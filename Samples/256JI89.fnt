<CN><EMB>OPINION AFTER TRIAL</EMB>
<Page 2>

<CN><EMB>I. INTRODUCTION</EMB>

<P20>This dispute is, at its core, about the parties blaming each other for the failure of their
longstanding business relationship.<fnr1> From 2006 to early 2018, Kavod Pharmaceuticals LLC<fnr2>
("Rising") and Tri Harbor Holdings Corporation<fnr3> ("Aceto") (collectively "Plaintiffs" or
"Rising/Aceto") and Sigmapharm Laboratories, LLC ("Sigmapharm" or "Defendant") were
parties to a Master Product Development and Collaboration Agreement (the "Agreement") to
develop, manufacture, and sell generic pharmaceutical products. For many years, the parties'
relationship was mutually beneficial and generally proceeded without incident. 

<P20>The parties' conflict began when Sigmapharm asked Rising/Aceto in May 2015 to
account for an increase in reported chargebacks, rebates and expenses against sales that reduced
the parties' shared net profits (which, under the Agreement, were generally paid 45% to
Rising/Aceto and 55% to Sigmapharm). Later that year, Sigmapharm requested an audit as
provided for under &sect; 8.6 of the Agreement. After the exchange of data (which took too long and
was incomplete, according to Sigmapharm), Sigmapharm sent Rising/Aceto a letter on
December 16, 2016 (the "December 16 Letter") that largely liquidated Sigmapharm's claims for
underpaid profits from April 2009 (the beginning of the productive life of the Agreement)
through March 31, 2016 ("Audit Period I") and reduced certain of those claims to invoices.<fnr4>
<Page 3>
From 2016 until early 2018, the parties continued to communicate and exchange at least some
information.<fnr5> Ultimately, on March 23, 2018, Sigmapharm sent Rising/Aceto a letter terminating
the Agreement based on alleged material breaches it asserts were described in the December 16
Letter.<fnr6>

<P20>This Court previously found, as part of its ruling on competing motions for summary
judgment, that Sigmapharm "unlawfully terminated and breached" the Agreement when it issued
the March 23, 2018 termination letter without providing the notice and opportunity to cure
required by the Agreement.<fnr7> The Court reserved for trial the issue of any damages resulting from
Sigmapharm's breach of the Agreement and the determination of the liability, if any, of
Rising/Aceto to Sigmapharm for any claimed breach of the Agreement by Plaintiffs.<fnr8> The Court
conducted a 33-day trial to determine the issues that remained after it granted partial summary
judgment. This Opinion sets forth the Court's resolution of those issues after trial.

<CN><EMB>II. JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT</EMB>

<P20>The Court has jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1334(b) and
the Standing Orders of Reference entered by the United States District Court on July 23, 1984,
and amended on September 18, 2012 (Standing Order 12-1), and as further amended on June 6,
2025 (Standing Order 2025-02). This is a core proceeding under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 157(b)(2)(A), (B),
(C) and (O). In its Answer, Sigmapharm admitted this Court's core jurisdiction.<fnr9> Venue is proper
<Page 4>
in this Court under 28 U.S.C. &sect; 1408. The Court issues the following findings of fact and
conclusions of law pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052. To the extent that any of the findings of
fact might constitute conclusions of law, they are adopted as such. Conversely, to the extent that
any conclusions of law constitute findings of fact, they are adopted as such.

<CN><EMB>III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</EMB>

<HN02><EMB>A. Pre-Bankruptcy Litigation and Subsequent Arbitration</EMB>

<P20>On March 23, 2018, the same day that Sigmapharm sent its Notice of Termination,
Sigmapharm commenced litigation against Rising/Aceto in the District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania (the "District Court Action")<fnr10> seeking various forms of relief,
including damages for breach of contract, a declaration that the Agreement had been validly
terminated, and to compel an audit.<fnr11> In the District Court Action, Sigmapharm filed a Motion to
Enforce an Audit, which Rising/Aceto opposed. Rising/Aceto then filed a Motion to Stay
Proceedings and Compel Arbitration based on the arbitration clause in the Agreement.<fnr12> By
Order and Opinion entered on October 26, 2018, the District Court granted Rising/Aceto's
Motion to Compel Arbitration; denied Sigmapharm's Motion to Compel an Audit (on the ground
that it was more properly considered in the context of the arbitration); and also ordered
Rising/Aceto to preserve records that could be relevant to the Plaintiff's audit.<fnr13> Sigmapharm
then moved to compel an audit in the Arbitration, which Rising/Aceto contested, at least
initially.<fnr14> That motion and the Arbitration itself were stayed by Rising/Aceto's bankruptcy filing
on February 19, 2019.
<Page 5>

<HN02><EMB>B. The Debtors' Bankruptcy Filing and the Shore Suven Sale</EMB>

<P20>Nine affiliated Debtors, including Plaintiffs, filed their voluntary Chapter 11 petitions for
reorganization on February 19, 2019.<fnr15> The Court granted the Debtors' motion to jointly
administer the cases.<fnr16> The Debtors promptly sold the components of their business operated
through Rising (the "Pharma Business") to Shore Suven Pharma, Inc. ("Shore Suven") pursuant
to a Sale Order entered on April 10, 2019 and the related Asset Purchase Agreements ("APA")
approved by that Order.<fnr17> That sale closed on April 19, 2019.<fnr18> Prior to the sale to Shore Suven,
the Pharma Business included Rising's relationship with Sigmapharm; however, the Agreement
between Rising/Aceto and Sigmapharm was not part of that sale.

<HN02><EMB>C. This Adversary Proceeding</EMB>

<P20>The Plaintiff commenced this adversary proceeding on July 18, 2019 by filing a nine-count
complaint against Sigmapharm.<fnr19> Sigmapharm filed its Answer and Counterclaims on
August 19, 2019.<fnr20>

<HN24><EMB>1. Pre-Trial Motion Practice</EMB>

<HN46><EMB>(a) Sigmapharm's Motion to Compel an Audit</EMB>

<P20>On December 23, 2020, Sigmapharm filed a Motion to Enforce the Audit Requirements
of the Agreement (the "Audit Motion"),<fnr21> which Rising/Aceto opposed.<fnr22> On June 7, 2021, after
extensive briefing and oral argument, this Court granted Sigmapharm's Audit Motion and
<Page 6>
entered an order mandating the audit (the "Audit Order").<fnr23> Among other things, the Audit Order
required Rising/Aceto to produce the documents that Sigmapharm's expert, Gregory Cowhey,
identified in his April 2, 2021 Report that were not previously produced.<fnr24> Following the
completion of any supplemental production(s), the Audit Order gave Sigmapharm the right to
make supplemental document/information requests and/or "sampling requests."<fnr25>

<HN46><EMB>(b) Discovery Disputes and Summary Judgment</EMB>

<P20>Prior to trial, there were numerous discovery disputes that required Court intervention.<fnr26>
Following discovery, the parties brought cross motions for summary judgment. On October 5,
2021, this Court issued an Opinion<fnr27> and accompanying Order<fnr28> denying in part and granting in
part the Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denying the Defendant's motion for
summary judgment.

<HN46><EMB>(c) Motions</EMB> <EMBI>in limine</EMBI>

<P20>The parties also filed multiple motions <EM>in limine.</EM><fnr29> Rising/Aceto filed a motion <EM>in limine</EM>
to limit or bar the testimony of Sigmapharm's expert, Gregory Cowhey, as to alleged lost profits
by Sigmapharm, <EM>i.e.,</EM> an alleged $9 million profit share underpayment for Audit Period I.<fnr30> The
Court granted in part and denied in part that motion, holding that Mr. Cowhey's opinion "with
respect to Audit Period I is improperly based and highly speculative," and "not a proper
<Page 7>
application of principles and methods to the facts of this case [.]"<fnr31> The other motions <EM>in limine</EM>
were all denied without prejudice pending trial.<fnr32>

<HN24><EMB>2. Trial</EMB>

<P20>The trial on the issues remaining after this Court's summary judgment ruling commenced
on February 23, 2023, and concluded on April 30, 2024, during which the Court heard 33 days of
testimony.<fnr33>

<HN46><EMB>(a) Damages Claimed</EMB>

<HN68><EMB>(i) Rising/Aceto</EMB>

<P20>Rising/Aceto asserts that as a remedy for Sigmapharm's unlawful termination of the
Agreement, it is owed expectation damages in the form of the lump-sum, net present value of the
future profits Rising/Aceto expected under the Agreement, measured by future Product sales
expected as of the March 23, 2018 date of breach. Rising/Aceto's expert witness, Laureen Ryan,
calculated those damages at between $10,041,270 to $12,683,777, as of August 19, 2024,
utilizing several different scenarios based on varying levels of price and unit erosion.
Rising/Aceto argues that Sigmapharm's actual sales of Products or Co-Owned Products
following its unlawful termination corroborate Rising/Aceto's expectation damages and, in fact,
prove that Ms. Ryan's estimates are conservative. As such, Rising/Aceto asserts that the Court
<Page 8>
should award lost profits damages to Rising/Aceto at the top of the range, <EM>i.e.,</EM> $12,683,777 (the
"Lost Profits").

<P20>As a separate and independent item of damage, Rising/Aceto claims that it is also owed
recovery of Sigmapharm's share of credits provided to customers for actual sales of Products
under the cost-and-profit-sharing formula of the Agreement. Rising/Aceto alleges that
Sigmapharm failed to pay or refund Rising/Aceto for its contractual share of over $9 million in
financial obligations owed to customers in the form of rebates, chargebacks, and various other
credits arising from pre-termination Product sales (the "Credit" or "Credit Refund" damages).
Finally, Rising/Aceto also claims an additional $668,802 in damages based on improper
calculation of the Costs of Goods Sold ("COGS") component of the profit share.

<HN68><EMB>(ii) Sigmapharm</EMB>

<P20>At trial, Mr. Kremer identified the following categories of damages: (i) $1.9 million claim
set forth in Exhibit A to the "Audit Results" Letter for Audit Period I; (ii) $1.1 million COGS set
forth in Exhibit C to that letter; (iii) $235,000 related to auditor fees; and (iv) "duplicate credit
memos" totaling approximately $300,000 arising from Mr. Hughes' analysis of Mr. Kremer's
claimed underpayments from Audit Period I.<fnr34> Sigmapharm also asserts that Rising/Aceto should
be denied any recovery based on its breaches of the Agreement.

<HN46><EMB>(b) Trial Witnesses</EMB>

<P20>Plaintiffs called the following fact witnesses: (i) Steven Rogers, Aceto's former Chief
Legal Officer and Secretary to Aceto's Board of Directors;<fnr35> (ii) Eugene Hughes, Rising's former
Senior Vice President of Finance;<fnr36> (iii) Rebecca Roof, Aceto's former Interim Chief Financial
<Page 9>
Officer;<fnr37> and (iv) Rajiv Hazaray, Aceto's former Senior Vice President of Strategic Planning.<fnr38>
Defendant called the following fact witnesses: (i) Bernard Katz,<fnr39> the Plan Administrator; and (ii)
Richard Kremer, Sigmapharm's former Vice President of Finance.<fnr40>

<P20>Each side called a single financial expert. Plaintiffs called Laureen M. Ryan, Managing
Director, Alvarez & Marsal ("A&M"), B.S. (Accounting), CPA, ABV, CDVB, CIRA, CFE ("Ms.
Ryan").<fnr41> Defendant called Gregory Cowhey, Principal, Financial Investigations and Dispute
Services, RSM US LLP ("RSM"), B.S. (Finance), MBA (Accounting), ASA, IBA, CVA, CFE,
NAFE ("Mr. Cowhey").<fnr42> Ms. Ryan proffered an opinion on Rising/Aceto's Lost Profits and also
gave rebuttal testimony regarding Mr. Cowhey's opinion concerning Sigmapharm's audit of
"Audit Period II" (defined as the period from April 1, 2016 to April 30, 2020). Mr. Cowhey
proffered an opinion regarding his firm's audit of Rising/Aceto's records for Audit Period II.
Sigmapharm did not present any rebuttal opinion testimony by Mr. Cowhey at trial (or
otherwise) relating to Rising/Aceto's alleged Lost Profits. Instead, Sigmapharm relied on the
cross-examination of Ms. Ryan and the testimony of Mr. Kremer.

<HN46><EMB>(c) Post-trial Submissions</EMB>

<P20>At the conclusion of the trial, the Court directed the parties to submit written Proposed
Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and to file replies. Over the objection of Sigmapharm,
the Court permitted limited further responses pursuant to a Second Amended Joint Order
<Page 10>
Scheduling Post-Trial Briefing.<fnr43> The parties submitted the following: (1) Plaintiffs' Post-Trial
Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law ("Pl's FoF");<fnr44>(2) Defendant's Findings of
Fact and Conclusions of Law ("Def's FoF");<fnr45> (3) Defendant's Reply Brief to Rising-Aceto's
Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law ("Def's Reply Brief");<fnr46> (4) Plaintiffs'
Response to Defendant's Post-Trial Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law ("Pl's
Response");<fnr47>(5) Plaintiffs' Further Response Pursuant to the Court's Second Amended Joint
Scheduling Order ("Pl's Further Response");<fnr48> and (6) Defendant's Response to Rising-Aceto's
December 3, 2024 Further Reply Brief ("Def's Further Response").<fnr49>

<CN><EMB>IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</EMB>

<HN02><EMB>A. Entering into the Agreement</EMB>

<P20>Sigmapharm and Rising entered into the Agreement at the center of this dispute on June
22, 2006.<fnr50> That was approximately three and one-half years before Rising was acquired by a
wholly owned subsidiary of Aceto (Sun Acquisition Corp.) in or about December 2010. That
subsidiary then changed its name to Rising, which assumed "old" Rising's obligations under the
Agreement.<fnr51>

<P20>Under the Agreement, Sigmapharm and Rising contracted to collaborate on the
development of generic pharmaceuticals, with Sigmapharm manufacturing, developing and
obtaining FDA approvals of the Products, and Rising doing the marketing and accounting for
<Page 11>
essential matters, such as "Net Sales" and "Net Profits" and serving as exclusive distributor of
"Co-Owned Products" (all as such terms are defined in the Agreement) for Sigmapharm.<fnr52>

<P20>The Agreement generally provided that: (i) Sigmapharm would be paid the cost of
manufacture plus 55% of the Net Profits; and (ii) Rising/Aceto would be paid for the cost of
distribution plus 45% of the Net Profits, all calculated in accordance with the Agreement.<fnr53>
Additionally, Rising/Aceto was entitled to an administrative fee for its services under the
Agreement pursuant to section 1.52 (the "Rising Fee"), which was subsequently amended.<fnr54>

<HN02><EMB>B. Key Provisions of the Agreement</EMB>

<P20>The crux of this dispute revolves around the requirements in Sections 1.37 and 8.6 of the
Agreement (the "Audit Provisions"), which mandate that Rising maintain "complete and
accurate records" and that its books and records "be transparent and readily available for
independent audit purposes." Section 1.37 of the Agreement states:

<B22>1.37 <EMB>"Net Sales"</EMB> shall mean, with respect to any Calendar Quarter, the gross amounts
invoiced by Rising or its Affiliates for Products sold to any Third Parties during such
Calendar Quarter less the sum of: (i) subject to Section 5.7 below [discounts/rebates],
chargebacks, cash and quantity discounts, returns, invoice adjustments, rebates (e.g.
customer and government) and other credits taken by customers or granted by Rising
with respect to such Product sales other than as a result of recalls; (ii) invoice adjustments
made for errors on invoiced sales included in previous calculations of Net Sales and not
yet accounted for; (iii) Freight; and (iv) marketing and advertising expenses (e.g., trade
journals, direct marketing, physician detailing, etc.) directly related to the marketing of
the Products. Subject to Section 8.6 [audit] below, all deductions listed in the above
articles (1.36 and 1.37) <EMBI>shall be transparent and readily available for independent audit
purposes.</EMBI> (emphasis added)

<P00>Section 8.6 of the Agreement states:

<B22>8.6. <EMB>Maintenance of Record; Audits.</EMB> During the term of this Agreement and for a
period of at least seven (7) years after the date of termination of this Agreement, each
Party shall <EMBI>keep complete and accurate records of all expenses incurred by it under this</EMBI>
<Page 12>
<EMBI>Agreement,</EMBI> which expenses are to be reimbursed by one or both of the other Parties. The
cost of audits shall be borne by each Party..., provided, however, that in the event such
audit by one Party of the other Party's records shows a discrepancy in excess of five
percent (5%) of the amount reported by such Party, the Party responsible for the
discrepancy will reimburse the auditing Party for the reasonable cost of such audit. Any
audit or inspection of books and records by a Party shall be conducted upon reasonable
written notice to the other Party, be conducted during normal business hours and will not
interfere materially with the business operations of the Party being audited or whose
books and records are being inspected .... (emphasis added)

<P00>Relatedly, the term "Net Profits" is defined in Section 1.36 of the Agreement as follows:

<B22>1.36 <EMB>"Net Profits"</EMB> (or losses as the case may be) shall mean, with respect to any
Calendar Quarter, the Net Sales obtained from the sale of Products in the Territory during
such Calendar Quarter, less the sum of: (i) Cost of Goods; (ii) Rising's Fee; (iii) amounts
repaid or credited by reason of recalls; (iv) pre-approved consulting and legal fees; (v)
Litigation Expenses; (vi) the cost of all Product(s) that are unsaleable or no longer
marketable; and (vii) any other costs or expense approved by the Parties.

<P20>The 55/45 division of the "Net Profits" is calculated and documented in accordance with
Sections 1.36, 1.37, 8.3, and 8.6 of the Agreement. Section 8.3 (Distribution of Net Profits),
required Rising to provide Sigmapharm with a profit-share statement 45 days after the end of
each quarter setting forth the calculation of Net Sales and Net Profits from the sale of Products
("Profit Share Statement").<fnr55> That calculation was performed using formulas that take into
consideration multiple factors and components based on the definitions described above, as well
as the gross-to-net accounting process utilized by Rising/Aceto.

<P20>Rising/Aceto maintained its books and records on an accrual basis and most of
Rising/Aceto's "partners" were provided Profit Share Reports that were calculated on an accrual
basis. However, Sigmapharm and at least one other partner, ThinQ, were on a cash basis.<fnr56> While
the Agreement itself is silent as to whether cash or accrual based accounting was to be used to
<Page 13>
calculate the profit share, both parties acknowledge that Sigmapharm's profit share was to be
calculated on a cash basis under the Agreement.<fnr57>

<HN02><EMB>C. Each Party's Roles Under the Agreement</EMB>

<P20>Under the Agreement, the parties agreed to "jointly collaborate" in, <EM>inter alia,</EM> the
manufacturing and marketing of certain generic pharmaceutical products ("Products" or "Co-Owned
Products").<fnr58> Sigmapharm assumed responsibility for developing, manufacturing, and
securing regulatory approvals for Products.<fnr59> Rising, in turn, assumed responsibility for
marketing, distributing, and selling Products.<fnr60> By its terms, the Agreement created a relationship
that "is intended to and shall be exclusive to the Parties."<fnr61>

<HN24><EMB>1. Joint Ownership of Products</EMB>

<P20>All Products subject to the Agreement were defined as "Co-Owned Products," meaning
that Rising/Aceto and Sigmapharm jointly owned the Products, including Abbreviated New Drug
Applications.<fnr62>

<HN24><EMB>2. Costs And Investments of Product Development</EMB>

<P20>As co-owners of the Products, Rising and Sigmapharm agreed to share both the costs and
investments necessary to bring Products to market, as well as the profits generated from their
sale.<fnr63> Sigmapharm manufactured and delivered Products to Rising, charging Rising a Transfer
<Page 14>
Price at the time of delivery. The Transfer Price represented an amount set forth in the applicable
Product Schedule to compensate Sigmapharm for the expense to manufacture the Product,
including a 15% premium.<fnr64>

<P20>The Agreement required Rising to pay to Sigmapharm 55% of the Net Profits realized
from its sale of Products, while Rising kept the remaining 45% as its share.<fnr65> Thus, the allocation
applicable to the distribution of Net Profits (under which Rising received the lower amount,
45%) is different than the allocation applicable to the payment of Development Costs (under
which Rising had to pay the higher amount, 55%). As was noted above, the calculation of Net
Profits and the issuance of quarterly Profit Share Statements, reflecting the profit share
calculations, was Rising's responsibility under the Agreement.

<HN02><EMB>D. Sigmapharm's Initial Audit Request</EMB>

<P20>During the relevant time period, Richard Kremer was Sigmapharm's Vice President of
Finance.<fnr66> Mr. Kremer had extensive experience in accounting and finance matters generally and
particularly as to the generic pharmaceutical business.<fnr67> He was the individual at Sigmapharm
primarily responsible for the accounting and financial aspects of Sigmapharm's business
relationship with Rising/Aceto.<fnr68> Mr. Kremer learned shortly after he started working at
Sigmapharm in February 2015 that it had never performed an audit of its financial relationship of
Rising/Aceto, which had started in 2009.<fnr69>
<Page 15>

<P20>Mr. Kremer testified that he first began to think an audit was necessary in May 2015,
when Rising/Aceto sent Sigmapharm calculations of the Net Profit splits that changed frequently
and, in his view, began including line-item costs that were required to be part of the Rising Fee
already deducted under the Agreement.<fnr70> In fact, Rising/Aceto's profits share number changed
four times in a 30-day period: on May 4, May 14, May 19, and June 1, 2015.<fnr71> These changes
impacted the Profit Share Statements by nearly $1.5 million.<fnr72> Through Mr. Kremer,
Sigmapharm's team discussed with Rising/Aceto's financial team, headed by Peter Licata
(Rising's then CFO), that Rising/Aceto needed to review a "number of elements" in its profit
share calculation.<fnr73>

<P20>Sigmapharm first asked for an audit at a November 20, 2015 meeting with
Rising/Aceto.<fnr74> Mr. Kremer, Dr. Spireas, and their team at Sigmapharm were in attendance at the
meeting along with Rising/Aceto's Satish Srinivasan and Mr. Licata to discuss the profit share
accounting issues being raised by Sigmapharm. During this meeting, Mr. Kremer "stated we
[Sigmapharm] wanted to perform an audit. Satish and Peter welcomed the opportunity."<fnr75>

<P20>One of the areas of concern discussed at the November 2015 meeting was the way in
which Rising/Aceto was calculating the COGS under the Agreement, which resulted in
<Page 16>
Sigmapharm being underpaid by $1.1 million, according to Mr. Kremer.<fnr76> Others areas of
concern included a new issue identified by Sigmapharm &mdash; negative accruals &mdash; and the
verification of profit share calculations.<fnr77> Soon thereafter, Mr. Kremer indicated that it appeared
that Rising/Aceto was calculating at least some aspects of the profit share on an accrual basis,
rather than the cash basis both parties acknowledged was required under the Agreement.<fnr78>
Accordingly, the parties discussed a "twofold" audit: (1) the calculation of COGS and (2)
verification of the profit share calculations. Sigmapharm indicated that it might seek an on-site
review with independent auditors.<fnr79>

<P20>On December 4, 2015, Sigmapharm's Mr. Kremer followed up with emails confirming in
writing its request for an audit. In the emails, Mr. Kremer described in detail the information
Sigmapharm needed to start the process "to keep our initial efforts confined to Bensalem," where
Sigmapharm is located, before "visiting and reviewing hard copy samples."<fnr80> Mr. Kremer
explained at trial that when Rising/Aceto started providing information in the first fiscal quarter
of 2015, it was in the form of an Excel spreadsheet with only total dollar and sales numbers. He
wanted more detail, so this request was for a "list of every invoice, every date, every customer,
every quantity, every SKU, and every invoice amount by or per unit that would support the total
dollar value they've claimed in this gross sales figure."<fnr81>

<P20>Mr. Kremer continued to seek information and send reminders in early 2016 (and
thereafter).<fnr82> During this period, Rising/Aceto, through Ms. Leslie Thomas, indicated that they
<Page 17>
would be available for an on-site audit the third week of any month.<fnr83> However, Mr. Kremer did
not believe that he had received the necessary information and back-up necessary before moving
to an on-site audit.<fnr84> As a result, Mr. Kremer indicated to Rising/Aceto that he first needed the
information electronically, and would then follow up with specific requests for hard copy
documents prior to a site visit.<fnr85> Mr. Kremer also followed up with Ms. Thomas to let her know
that Sigmapharm wanted to audit the years from the inception of the relationship in 2009<fnr86>
through 2015.<fnr87>

<P20>Shortly thereafter, on February 25, 2016, Mr. Kremer again followed up with
Rising/Aceto. His inquiry focused on COGS, because he believed that Rising/Aceto owed $1.1
million for its previous incorrect method of calculation, and the profit share calculations, which
he believed were being made on an accrual basis rather than on a cash basis.<fnr88> On March 1 and
again on March 9, 2016, Mr. Kremer followed up with emails asking when Sigmapharm would
receive the information that it had been requesting since November 2015.<fnr89> After Mr. Kremer
followed up again with Rising/Aceto's Scott Elian on March 15, 2016, Ms. Thomas provided
information for 2009 through 2014, although it was still not sufficient in Mr. Kremer's view to
<Page 18>
begin an audit because the information did not include key data fields he believed were
necessary to properly analyze the data.<fnr90>

<P20>Discovery and trial revealed that Rising/Aceto shared Mr. Kremer's concerns about the
integrity of Rising/Aceto's profit share data. In fact, immediately after Ms. Thomas sent
Rising/Aceto's historical data to Sigmapharm, Rising/Aceto's CFO Doug Roth asked Mr. Licata
and Mr. Elian if they vetted the numbers and checked the data against the statements actually
sent to Sigmapharm. Mr. Roth asked because he believed that "<EM>i[t] would be a miracle [i]f they
agreed or were in the same ballpark.</EM>"<fnr91> In the meantime, Mr. Kremer continued to follow up
with his requests during the middle of 2016.<fnr92>

<P20>By June of 2016, Sigmapharm was convinced that Rising/Aceto had been calculating and
paying net profits on an accrual rather than cash basis, resulting in a potential underpayment to
Sigmapharm of $2.5 million.<fnr93> According to Mr. Kremer, Mr. Licata admitted that Rising/Aceto
did, in fact, include accrued expenses in the Profit Share Statements which were supposed to be
on a cash basis.<fnr94> Sigmapharm then began seeking information relating to the accruals, as it had
an obvious impact on the profit share to which Sigmapharm was entitled. Similarly, the accrual
information was necessary for Sigmapharm to assess whether it should switch to accrual based
partnership accounting, as requested by Rising/Aceto.<fnr95> As discussed below, Rising/Aceto's
outdated accounting software or "architecture" made it extremely difficult for Rising/Aceto to
<Page 19>
maintain two sets of books &mdash; one based on accrual accounting and the other based on cash. These
deficiencies contributed significantly to the delays and errors in the information provided to
Sigmapharm in response to its audit requests.

<HN02><EMB>E. Rising/Aceto's Responses to Sigmapharm's Information Requests</EMB>

<P20>In response to Sigmapharm's complaints about delay and failure to provide the requested
information, Rising/Aceto asserts that it ultimately provided Sigmapharm with all of the detail
and information requested. In fact, on March 18, 2016, Rising/Aceto delivered detailed listings
of sales and credits in the form of Excel spreadsheets covering the period of 2009 to 2015.<fnr96>
After reviewing these spreadsheets, Mr. Kremer wrote back to request that Rising/Aceto provide
additional fields in the exported data (<EM>e.g.,</EM> the date of invoice or credit memo; customer name,
number, and facility; and quantity).<fnr97> On direct examination, Mr. Kremer made much of these
missing fields, claiming that these initial spreadsheets "didn't have enough information, enough
fields for [him] to do anything" and were "grossly... inadequate" and "not complete."<fnr98>

<P20>But that was not the full story, as Rising/Aceto worked to correct these issues. On March
31, 2016, Rising/Aceto provided revised spreadsheets containing the requested information for
three years: 2013,<fnr99> 2014,<fnr100> and 2015.<fnr101> As to the balance, Rising/Aceto advised that the older
<Page 20>
years (2009 through 2012) would require more time. On June 9, 2016, Rising/Aceto provided
revised spreadsheets for the period 2009 to 2012.<fnr102> After confirming receipt of this data, Mr.
Kremer asked for the same data in the same detail for 1Q 2016.<fnr103> Rising/Aceto delivered that
data a week later.<fnr104> Thus, notwithstanding his protests to the contrary, by mid-June 2016 Mr.
Kremer had received all of the listings of sales and credits that he requested for Audit Period I.<fnr105>

<P20>The spreadsheets provided Mr. Kremer with transaction-by-transaction detail regarding
the sale of each Product at the Gross Sale price and each credit given to that customer, including
chargebacks, rebates, and returns. For example, in the 1Q 2016 spreadsheet, Mr. Kremer received
a tab titled "1Q16 Sigmapharm Product Detail," showing each and every individual sale of
Product during the quarter, by National Drug Code number, name of Product, dosage form of the
Product, the customer who bought the Product, invoice number for the sale, date of the sale, and
amount of the sale (by units and by dollars).<fnr106> The same spreadsheet tab identifies all returns,
rebates, and other credits recognized during the quarter, again providing the same information.<fnr107>
Further tabs in the same spreadsheet<fnr108> identify each and every chargeback and rebate provided
in the quarter.<fnr109>

<P20>These spreadsheets provided Mr. Kremer with the detail he requested for his purpose of
comparing the transaction-level data to the Profit Share Statements. To aid that effort, Mr.
<Page 21>
Kremer compiled the many Excel spreadsheets Rising/Aceto provided into a single, all-encompassing
spreadsheet for the entire Audit Period I, which contained over 900,000 rows of
data with multiple columns.<fnr110> In this fashion, Mr. Kremer was able to determine whether there
were any duplicate credit memos or transactions in the data.<fnr111> And it allowed Mr. Kremer to
compare the Gross Sales and deductions to Gross Sales against the figures Rising/Aceto reported
in the Profit Share Statements.<fnr112>

<P20>During his direct examination, Mr. Kremer stated that he also wanted to request backup
documents on a sample basis to determine whether they corroborated the listings of sales and
credits. He did do so, but his actual requests were limited. On June 6, 2016, Mr. Kremer
requested six credit memos referenced in the underlying spreadsheets.<fnr113> Rising/Aceto provided
them and each of those credit memos supported the deductions listed in the spreadsheets, as Mr.
Kremer admitted on cross-examination.<fnr114> These six credit memos (plus an invoice) were the
only "backup" documents Sigmapharm requested to corroborate the transactions during Audit
Period I, as this Court recognized in its Summary Judgment Opinion.<fnr115>

<P20>On cross-examination, Mr. Kremer conceded that he ultimately received what he
requested through December 4, 2015 &mdash; specifically, the "listing[s]" of all invoices sent from
Rising/Aceto to its customers, reported as Gross Sales; and the "listing[s]" of all credit memos or
other customer credits, for each and every year in question.<fnr116> After reviewing each of these
<Page 22>
spreadsheets and supporting information in detail, Mr. Kremer acknowledged that Rising/Aceto
answered his requests for the period 2009-2015.<fnr117>

<P20>With respect to the third item requested by the December 4, 2015 email (linking
deductions to the specific Products), Rising/Aceto provided to Sigmapharm underlying data that
allocated all deductions (<EM>e.g.,</EM> chargebacks, rebates, returns, and cash discounts) to specific
Products. According to Rising/Aceto, it did not claim any deductions (such as general overhead)
that were not allocated to a specific Product. Thus, what Rising/Aceto produced in response to
Mr. Kremer's requests was all it had. Sigmapharm did not prove otherwise.

<P20>With respect to the request addressed to inventory, Mr. Kremer wanted to compare the
number of Product units that Sigmapharm delivered to Rising/Aceto with the Product units that
Rising/Aceto sold to customers, to determine if any inventory was unaccounted for.<fnr118> Because
the listings of sales were reported on a unit basis, this would allow Mr. Kremer to compare the
number of units sold against Sigmapharm's own records of the units it shipped to Rising/Aceto
and identify any missing Product units or other discrepancies.<fnr119> At trial, Sigmapharm did not
demonstrate why this response was insufficient, although it continued to state that Rising/Aceto
did not supply the requested information. But Sigmapharm certainly knew what Products it sold
<Page 23>
to Rising/Aceto so it easily could have done the comparison that way, even without receiving the
same information directly from Rising/Aceto.

<P20>Sigmapharm and Mr. Kremer also complained about not receiving source or original
documents and not being able to do an "on-site" review.<fnr120> However, the record reflects that Mr.
Kremer received the few "original" documents he requested (as confirmed by the December 16
Letter itself) and that he was offered the ability to conduct an on-site inspection the third week of
any month.<fnr121> Thus, Sigmapharm could have performed its on-site inspection or requested any
additional source documents during the six or so months from Sigmapharm's receipt of the
underlying data until it issued the December 16 Letter, but it did not do so.<fnr122>

<HN02><EMB>F. December 16 Letter</EMB>

<P20>Mr. Kremer sent to Mr. Licata at Rising/Aceto an email attaching the December 16, 2016
Letter, which summarized the results of his review of the sales and credit information provided
to him by Rising/Aceto.<fnr123> The subject line of the email read: "Profit Share Calculation
Audit/Review."<fnr124> The attachment line of the email read: "Audit Results Letter with attachments
Final 2016 12 16.pdf." The December 16 Letter itself contained the reference line "Review of
Profit Share Payment Support" and consisted of a cover page and twelve pages of exhibits.<fnr125>

<P20>Mr. Kremer began the cover page by stating that he had "<EMBI>concluded</EMBI> [his] review of the
documentation [Rising] provided to [Sigmapharm] in May, June and September 2016. The
submitted documentation covers the parties' business relationship, pursuant to their agreement
<Page 24>
dated June 22, 2006, and as amended subsequently ("Agreement"), from April 2009 through
March 2016."<fnr126> Thus, Mr. Kremer himself referred to the results of his efforts as an audit/review
of Rising/Aceto's profit share calculation for this period (referred to in this Opinion as "Audit
Period I") and stated that his work in this regard had "concluded." In other words, Sigmapharm's
claims that this was not an audit and that his review was not completed are contradicted by Mr.
Kremer's words and his description of his own letter.

<P20>In the December 16 Letter, Mr. Kremer provided a list of the documents and information
that he had reviewed (including certain original or "actual" documents) and attached five
exhibits (lettered A through E). Exhibits A (Underpaid Profit Share) and C (amount owed based
on reduction of COGS) were demands, with calculations for payment of specific amounts of
alleged underpayments. Exhibit E was a demand for a previously unpaid equipment invoice.
These three monetary demands (A, C, E) were reduced to new invoices. In sum, Sigmapharm's
monetary demands in the December 16 Letter were:

<B22>$1,905,110.38 Underpaid profit share (Q2-2009 through Q1-2016) (Exhibit A)
$1,109,491.91 Underpaid profit share based on reduction in COGS
(Q2-2009 through Q1-2016) (Exhibit C)
$225,000.00 Share of equipment cost for abandoned product (Exhibit E).

<P20>Exhibit B sought additional information as to cash discounts and CMS (Medicaid)
rebates, and Exhibit D sought additional information about a damaged shipment of Products.
Rising/Aceto provided the detailed information requested regarding the cash discounts and CMS
rebates.<fnr127> As to the damaged Products, Rising/Aceto provided Sigmapharm a credit in the
amount of $9,192, which resolved that issue as well.<fnr128> Rising also paid the $225,000,<fnr129> leaving
<Page 25>
open at this time only the invoices for allegedly underpaid profit share (Exhibits A and C).<fnr130>
These two remaining claims are resolved by this Opinion.

<HN02><EMB>G. Post-December 16, 2016 Activities</EMB>

<P20>Less than a week after the December 16 Letter, Mr. Kaczmarek of Rising/Aceto wrote to
Dr. Spireas of Sigmapharm inviting him to a meeting to discuss Rising/Aceto's response. A
month later, Mr. Kaczmarek followed that invitation up with a reminder email.<fnr131> On May 17,
2017, five months after the initial invitation, Dr. Spireas responded by apologizing for the delay,
but also indicating that the delay was the result of not receiving required data from Rising/Aceto.
Dr. Spireas's letter further stated that the parties were coming to a "pivotal moment" in their
relationship, that the issues outlined in the December 16 Letter "are unresolved since the end of
last year," and that last accounting and profit share report that was sent by Rising/Aceto for Q1
2017 "is very alarming and rather unacceptable."<fnr132> That report indicated to Sigmapharm that it
was being substantially underpaid. This led to Rising/Aceto's substantial "recast" of the profit
share described below.

<P20>On May 23, 2017, Mr. Kaczmarek and Mr. Hazaray on behalf of Rising/Aceto traveled to
Sigmapharm's offices in Pennsylvania to meet with Dr. Spireas and Mr. Kremer. The meeting
was supposed to focus on the December 16 Letter, but during that meeting Mr. Hazaray advised
that Rising/Aceto had become aware of potential problems in the calculation of Net Profits for
fiscal year ("FY") 2017 (July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017), which lay outside of Audit Period
<Page 26>
I.<fnr133> Mr. Hazaray told the parties that Rising/Aceto planned to engage EisnerAmper as outside
accountants to address Rising/Aceto's accounting issues.

<P20>On September 15, 2017, Rising/Aceto provided a file to Sigmapharm that contained the
results of Rising/Aceto's review of the December 16 Letter and preliminary findings of the FY
2017 recast.<fnr134> Those preliminary findings indicated that for FY 2017 Rising/Aceto should have
paid Sigmapharm $12,351,723 (later corrected to $12,629,930) but had paid only $3,564,490.32,
meaning Rising/Aceto owed Sigmapharm over $9 million. After this disclosure, Rising/Aceto
fully paid Sigmapharm the difference in installments over a period of approximately two months.

<P20>About a week later, on September 21, 2017, Rising/Aceto representatives again traveled
to Sigmapharm's offices for an in-person meeting to discuss Rising/Aceto's findings.<fnr135> Mr.
Hughes provided Sigmapharm with an updated version of the FY 2017 recast, which provided
for an adjustment of $1,399,160 on a total profit share of $12,629,930.<fnr136> In addition, Mr.
Hughes explained his investigation into the December 16 Letter.<fnr137>

<P20>After that, Sigmapharm continued requesting information. On November 14, 2017,
Rising/Aceto representatives Mr. Kaczmarek, Mr. Hazaray, and Mr. Hughes once again travelled
to Sigmapharm's offices for an in-person meeting.<fnr138> The meeting was attended by Dr. Spireas,
Mr. Kremer and others for Sigmapharm. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss historical
financial issues and the future business relationship.<fnr139> Rising/Aceto presented a PowerPoint to
<Page 27>
"review the entire portfolio" and discuss a business plan.<fnr140> This meeting apparently did not go
well because after it, Mr. Kaczmarek indicated to his colleagues that he thought Rising/Aceto
should focus its resources in directions other than Sigmapharm going forward.<fnr141> Subsequent to
that meeting, in late 2017 and early 2018, there were certain limited exchanges between the
parties that related principally to Audit Period II that Rising/Aceto admittedly did not fully
respond to.<fnr142>

<P20>That was the general state of affairs on March 23, 2018 when Sigmapharm sent
Rising/Aceto a letter titled "Notice of Termination" purporting to terminate the Agreement for
cause based on Rising/Aceto's failure to cure material breaches. As previously noted, on the
same day it sent the Notice of Termination, Sigmapharm initiated the District Court Action
against Rising/Aceto seeking various forms of relief, including damages for breach of contract, a
declaration that the Agreement had been validly terminated, and to compel an audit.<fnr143> As noted,
the District Court litigation was stayed in favor of the Arbitration. The Arbitration was then
stayed by Rising/Aceto's bankruptcy filing. Those issues were then rejoined, and new ones
raised when Rising/Aceto filed this adversary proceeding.

<CN><EMB>V. SUMMARY OF RULINGS</EMB>

<P20>In this case, both parties assert that the other materially breached the Agreement. As
previously noted, Rising/Aceto alleged, and this Court found, that Sigmapharm breached that
Agreement by terminating it on March 23, 2018, without giving Rising/Aceto the required prior
<Page 28>
written notice and opportunity to cure.<fnr144> By that same Order, this Court denied Sigmapharm's
Motion to Dismiss Rising/Aceto's Complaint in its entirety based primarily on Rising/Aceto's
alleged breach of the Audit Provisions of the Agreement because the underlying factual issues
could only be decided after trial.<fnr145> The Court has now conducted the trial of these and other
disputed issues, including the quantum of Rising/Aceto's alleged damages, and finds that
Rising/Aceto materially breached the Audit Provisions of the Agreement. As to quantum of
Rising/Aceto's alleged damages, the Court finds that Rising/Aceto is entitled to recover a portion
of its claimed damages but the Court will reduce and limit Rising/Aceto's damages based on
Rising/Aceto's breaches of the Agreement. Those breaches include:

<B24> &bull; Failing to "maintain transparent," "readily available" and "complete and accurate
records of all expenses incurred" under the Agreement. <EM>See</EM> &sect;&sect; 1.37 and 8.6 of the
Agreement. Trial revealed that Rising/Aceto's records were anything but transparent,
readily available or complete and accurate. Instead, in a process that was filled with
delays and obfuscations by Rising/Aceto, the documents provided to Sigmapharm in
its quest for an audit were often conflicting, inconsistent and opaque. The documents
and information included negative credit memos, duplicate credit memos, negative
accruals, and undefined "non-prod buckets" filled with millions of dollars of
unallocated or improperly allocated entries that resulted in, among other things, a
multimillion dollar "recast" of Sigmapharm's profit share.

<B24>&bull; Repeatedly delaying and obstructing Sigmapharm's efforts to obtain an "independent
audit," as permitted by the Agreement. After more than a year of pre-litigation delays,
it took another three plus years of litigation and arbitration proceedings before the
District Court in Pennsylvania, an arbitration tribunal, and this Court before
Sigmapharm could conduct its audit of Audit Period II. Even then, this Court was
required to enter the Audit Order to compel Rising/Aceto to allow the audit of Audit
Period II.

<B24>&bull; Failing to provide Sigmapharm with its profit share calculation on a cash basis, as
both parties acknowledge was required by the Agreement.

<B24>&bull; Failing to provide accrual balances and accrual calculation files that would allow
Sigmapharm to analyze and evaluate: (i) the accrual and assertedly cash based Profit
<Page 29>
Share Statements provided to Sigmapharm; and (ii) Rising/Aceto's request that
Sigmapharm move to accrual based profit share accounting.

<B24>&bull; Leading Sigmapharm to believe that Rising/Aceto engaged EisnerAmper to produce
an independent audit or report of Rising/Aceto's partner share accounting that would
be provided to Sigmapharm. After first telling Sigmapharm that the production of that
report was delayed for various reasons, Rising/Aceto then unilaterally decided to
abandon that independent review in favor of an "internal" one that was provided by
Rising/Aceto, all without advising Sigmapharm of this material change in advance. 

<P20>Having determined that both parties were in breach, the Court must decide how that
impacts the parties' damage claims. In this regard, Rising/Aceto claims total damages of up to
$26,945,848 as of August 19, 2024, plus post-judgment interest accruing thereafter, made up of
the following:<fnr146>

</T>
<P20>For the reasons that will be discussed in more detail below, the Court determines that a
fair and equitable result in these circumstances, with both parties in breach and Rising/Aceto in
severe financial distress, is to award Rising/Aceto damages in the amount of $9,096,273 for
"Credits" that Sigmapharm failed to provide as the result of its wrongful termination of the
Agreement. This amount represented actual losses to Rising/Aceto resulting from increased and
unreimbursed customer deductions incurred by Rising/Aceto after Sigmapharm improperly
terminated and breached the Agreement. These are "hard" costs and numbers that would have
<Page 30>
been shared with (and effectively reimbursed by) Sigmapharm if it had not improperly
terminated the Agreement. This amount will, however, be subject to a credit and offset based on 
the COGS damages awarded to Sigmapharm, as described below. 

<P20>The Court finds differently as to the "Lost Profits" claimed by Rising/Aceto, which is a
much "softer" calculation, especially for a failing business like Rising/Aceto, which declared
bankruptcy less than a year after the Agreement was terminated, immediately thereafter ceased
all ongoing business operations and did not include the Agreement in the assets it sold for a sharp
discount two months after filing for bankruptcy. Awarding Rising/Aceto 6 to 12 years of Lost
Profits damages in these circumstances would provide Rising/Aceto with what amounts to an
unwarranted windfall in the face of its own material and continuing breaches of the Agreement
and the imminent failure of its business. Accordingly, the Court will not award any damages to
Rising/Aceto for Lost Profits.

<P20>As to Sigmapharm's damage claims, the Court will not award any damages to
Sigmapharm for its claim in the amount of $1,905,110.38 based on what it asserted were
incorrect net sales and profit share calculations by Rising/Aceto for Audit Period I. As was
shown by Rising/Aceto, this aspect of Sigmapharm's claim was not included in Sigmapharm's
Proofs of Claim, even though it asserted claims of over $37 million.<fnr147> Additionally,
Rising/Aceto initially asserted that this claim was resolved by a payment of $277,101 to
Sigmapharm which Mr. Hughes calculated based on credits missing from Mr. Kremer's
analysis.<fnr148> Sigmapharm did not dispute this amount (or that payment) until after it terminated
the Agreement, a fact Mr. Kremer did not refute at trial.<fnr149>
<Page 31>

<P20>During trial, Rising/Aceto advised that the $277,101 amount was incorrect and that it
actually owed Sigmapharm an additional $330,000 for Audit Period I. This error was the result 
of credits that Mr. Hughes later recognized were already included in Mr. Kremer's analysis and
therefore should not have been included in Mr. Hughes' counter-analysis. Rising/Aceto's position
is that it voluntarily addressed this error by crediting the $330,000 against its overall damages
claims.<fnr150> The Court recognizes that Sigmapharm does not agree that the $277,101 payment and
the later $330,000 credit resolved this aspect of its claim. The Court finds otherwise based on the
omission of this claim from Sigmapharm's Proofs of Claim, the testimony of Mr. Hughes, and
the near match of the approximately $300,000 claim made by Mr. Kremer as to the double
counting of certain credits with the $330,000 adjustment for this same issue made by Mr.
Hughes.<fnr151>

<P20>As to the COGS damages claimed by both parties, the Court determines that Mr.
Kremer's calculation was correct, based on the terms of the Agreement itself and the parties'
prior dealings. Accordingly, Rising/Aceto's "Credit" damages will be reduced by the $1,109,492
in COGS damages claimed by Sigmapharm and the pro rata interest on that amount.
Rising/Aceto's claim for additional damages based on its version of the COGS calculation is
therefore denied.

<P20>In sum, the Court awards judgment in favor of Rising/Aceto against Sigmapharm in the 
amount of $7,986,781 ($9,096,273-$1,109,492), plus interest at the Federal Judgment Rate from
<Page 32>
March 23, 2018 (the date of Sigmapharm's breach) until fully paid.<fnr152> 

<CN><EMB>VI. LEGAL ANALYSIS</EMB>

<HN02><EMB>A. Rising/Aceto's Breaches of the Agreement</EMB> 

<HN24><EMB>1. Rising/Aceto Materially Breached the Agreement by Failing to Provide Transparent,
Accurate, Complete and Readily Available Records</EMB>

<P20>The Court finds that Rising/Aceto's protracted delays in responding to Sigmapharm's
audit and document requests, and the information provided by Rising/Aceto in response to those
requests, was in violation of the plain language and spirit of the Agreement's Audit Provisions.
The Agreement required Rising/Aceto to maintain complete, accurate and transparent records
that were readily available for independent audit. Instead, Sigmapharm got opaque, delayed, and
inconsistent information that ultimately required years, motion practice, and expert testimony to
obtain and decipher.

<P20>In other words, even if this Court were to find that Rising/Aceto maintained complete
records, Sigmapharm established, by more than a preponderance of the evidence, that these
records are neither accurate nor transparent, nor were they readily available for an independent
audit. Additionally, Rising/Aceto's Profit Share Reports to Sigmapharm were marred by often
inconsistent, confusing, constantly changing numbers, as well as documentation and information
that were provided only after repeated requests, delays, and even deception (as noted with
respect to EisnerAmper's involvement).
<Page 33>

<HN46><EMB>(a) Rising/Aceto's Outdated and Inadequate Accounting Systems Were Unable to
Handle the Cash Based Accounting Required Under the Agreement</EMB>

<P20>Sigmapharm alleges that Rising/Aceto did not have adequate accounting systems,
policies or procedures in place to provide transparent and readily available accounting records as
required under the Agreement, particularly as pertains to cash based accounting. Rising/Aceto
counters this argument with evidence that they maintained substantial accounting programs
which included an enterprise resource planning system (ERP); a revenue management system
(iContracts); and regular review by independent auditor, BDO USA, P.C. ("BDO").<fnr153> However,
when asked for copies of the written accounting policies and procedures it maintained, all
Rising/Aceto could point to was a flow chart that was actually produced by BDO (rather than
Rising/Aceto).<fnr154> A flow chart produced by an outside accounting firm does not constitute
internal accounting policies and procedures. The Court finds that Rising/Aceto did not have any
such written policies or procedures.

<P20>Even more significantly, the record is replete with evidence of Rising/Aceto's accounting
systems being unable to handle cash based accounting. Similarly, trial exposed the negative
accruals, non-prod issues, and duplicate and negative credit memos that led to ever-changing
accountings from Rising/Aceto and incomplete and delayed responses to Sigmapharm's
information requests.

<P20>The reasons for Rising/Aceto's accounting issues were varied but related in large part to
the outdated Great Plains accounting system Rising/Aceto used at the time and the fact that
Sigmapharm's profit share accounting was to be performed on a cash basis, while Rising/Aceto
was generally on an accrual basis. Rising/Aceto's witnesses, Mr. Hughes and Mr. Hazaray (both
<Page 34>
in Finance), candidly acknowledged the limitations in the Great Plains system, especially when it
came to maintaining its books on both an accrual and cash basis.<fnr155> In fact, during the latter part
of this period, after Rising/Aceto acquired certain product lines from Citron Pharma, LLC and
Lucid Pharma, LLC in December 2016 (the "Citron/Lucid Acquisition"), Rising/Aceto switched
to a more advanced and capable system called SAP in May 2018. However, the transfer took
longer than expected and was not completed until May of 2018, two months <EM>after</EM> Sigmapharm
terminated the Agreement.<fnr156>

<P20>Recognizing the deficiencies and difficulties they were facing in providing a cash basis
profit share to Sigmapharm, Rising/Aceto understandably asked Sigmapharm to move to accrual
based accounting. Sigmapharm indicated a willingness to consider this switch, but Mr. Kremer
repeatedly advised Rising/Aceto that he needed to "establish, audit and verify the beginning
balances of the accrued refunds and allowances figures" in order to do so.<fnr157> The Court agrees
that these beginning balances were necessary. However, as was acknowledged by Mr. Hughes,
these balances were never provided to Sigmapharm, even though Sigmapharm specifically asked
for them as part of the process to determine whether to make the switch to accrual accounting
(and its other information requests).<fnr158>

<P20>Relatedly, Rising/Aceto did not produce during the parties' relationship (or this litigation)
the "large partnership files" which would have included the beginning and ending estimates
<Page 35>
made by Rising/Aceto of its accrual balance with partners.<fnr159> According to Mr. Hughes, those
"large partnership files" also included information as to when accruals were reversed and a
checklist of "controls."<fnr160> Mr. Hughes also acknowledged that Sigmapharm would have to
review these files and Rising's related workpapers to audit Rising/Aceto's accrual calculations.<fnr161>
As noted, that did not happen, resulting in a breach of the Agreement.

<P20>In response to this admitted deficiency, Rising/Aceto argues that these documents were
produced during trial, and were referenced in an EisnerAmper report, and by Mr. Hughes in his
deposition.<fnr162> Rising/Aceto then characterizes this as a discovery dispute and argues that trial
was too late for Sigmapharm to raise this issue. But that argument misses the point.
Sigmapharm's position is that it needed those files while the parties were proceeding under the
Agreement in order to evaluate Rising/Aceto's proposal to switch to accrual accounting, as well
as part of Rising/Aceto's record-keeping obligations under the Agreement's Audit Provisions.<fnr163>
Rising/Aceto does not claim Sigmapharm received those files at that time, and Mr. Kremer's
unrebutted testimony was that Sigmapharm did not. Production of those records at trial was too
late and a passing reference to them in a deposition or report (that Rising/Aceto did not produce)
was not enough. Therefore, the failure to produce the "large partnership files" was another
breach of the Agreement.

<P20>Rising/Aceto also argues in response to these glaring and admitted deficiencies that: (i)
the accrual figures are irrelevant because Sigmapharm was on a cash basis and that as a result,
Sigmapharm's audit rights under the Agreement were limited to cash accounting; and (ii) in any
<Page 36>
event, Rising/Aceto "provided a complete cash basis accounting for the <EM>parties' entire
relationship.</EM>"<fnr164> The Court disagrees.

<P20>As to the first argument, because Rising/Aceto's books were admittedly prepared on an
accrual basis, those accruals had to be reviewed by Sigmapharm to determine whether the
alleged cash basis accounting Rising/Aceto provided was accurate. That need is obvious and is
further highlighted by the fact that in many instances, Rising/Aceto provided Sigmapharm with
accrual based profit share reporting. Put simply, Sigmapharm needed and was entitled to the
accrual information in exercising its audit rights, and to consider the proposed switch to accrual
accounting. The Court finds that these accruals, their reversals, and how the accrual/reversal
process was handled by Rising/Aceto was extremely relevant and, indeed, essential to
Sigmapharm's audit. That need was further highlighted by the many errors and deficiencies in
the information Rising/Aceto did ultimately provide, including negative accruals, negative credit
memos, duplicate credit memos, the non-prod buckets, the lack of policies and procedures, and
insufficient accounting software. In the context of this relationship in particular, Sigmapharm's
audit rights were not and could not be limited to cash accounting. In other words, there was no
way for Sigmapharm to determine whether Rising/Aceto's profit share accountings were correct
without having the underlying information that Rising/Aceto used to arrive at the allegedly cash
basis accountings it provided to Sigmapharm.

<P20>As to Rising/Aceto's assertion that it provided a complete cash basis accounting for the
parties' entire relationship, the Court again disagrees based on Rising/Aceto's candid
acknowledgements (through Mr. Hughes) that: (i) Rising never provided a cash basis accounting
for 2017; (ii) Rising/Aceto did not have sufficient processes and controls to allow Rising/Aceto
<Page 37>
to identify whether there were accounting and informational errors in the past profit share
accountings it provided, particularly as relates to accrual accounting; and (iii) that even
attempting to do so (which it did not) would be "very difficult."<fnr165>

<P20>Here, the Court notes that Mr. Hughes came to Rising at a time when it was in crisis, and
he was faced with multiple serious accounting and finance issues. Those issues included not only
the deteriorating relationship with Sigmapharm, one of its most "important" partners, and the
audit Sigmapharm requested, but also the failed transaction with Citron/Lucid that resulted in a
charge off of more than $250 million by Rising/Aceto and all the related accounting, audit, and
company-wide issues that had to be dealt with on an urgent basis. As the emails produced by
Rising/Aceto confirm, Mr. Hughes "was too busy doing the recast" and "too busy with the fire
hose pointing toward the building."<fnr166> Mr. Hughes simply had too much to do otherwise and
could not go back to review and correct Rising/Aceto's past accounting.<fnr167> Thus, contrary to
Rising/Aceto's argument, it did not provide Sigmapharm with a cash based accounting for the
parties' entire relationship and was simply unable or unwilling to do so prior to termination of
the parties' relationship. This is another breach of the Agreement's Audit Provisions.

<HN46><EMB>(b) Accounting Issues</EMB>

<HN68><EMB>(i) Negative Credit Memos</EMB> 

<P20>Rising/Aceto produced various documents during the course of this litigation and in
response to Sigmapharm's sampling requests in connection with the audit ordered by this Court.
The productions included multiple negative credit memos that showed, on their face,
<Page 38>
Rising/Aceto seeking payment from the customer, rather than the customer receiving a credit.<fnr168>
According to Mr. Cowhey, 28% of the audit samples included negative credit memos, which is
certainly a cause for concern and "doesn't make any sense ... at all."<fnr169> In fact, Mr. Hughes
could not explain why over 28% of the samples had negative credit memos, nor why, if these
negative credit memos were the result of a printing error, no one checked or tried to correct
them.<fnr170>

<P20>These negative credit memos instructed the customer to "Please Remit To" Rising/Aceto
a payment in a negative amount.<fnr171> Mr. Hughes explained that the credit memos were printed on
an incorrect template and should have stated "remit to" the customer, <EM>i.e.,</EM> a printing error.<fnr172> Yet,
at the same time, Rising/Aceto argues that a negative credit memo is an accurate way of
reflecting a credit owed to a customer. The Court disagrees. A "negative" credit memo that calls
for payment by a customer, but is really a credit to a customer, is not a complete, accurate or
transparent record.

<P20>Additionally, while Rising/Aceto did eventually produce evidence (in the form of a
general ledger) that indicated that the negative credit memos were actually properly accounted
for as credits and not debits, that was only after this Court ordered Rising/Aceto to do so at trial.
The facially contradictory and undeniably confusing negative credit memos produced during the
course of this litigation plainly did not comply with the Agreement's requirement to maintain
<Page 39>
complete and accurate records that are transparent and readily available for an independent audit.
Further, even giving credence to Rising/Aceto's printing error explanation, Rising/Aceto's failure
to print (or re-print) the credit memos on the proper template further evidences its failure to
maintain complete, accurate, and transparent records, as well as flaws in its accounting systems.

<HN68>(<EMB>ii) Duplicate Credit Memos</EMB>

<P20>Sigmapharm's review of a Rising/Aceto spreadsheet which was presented as audit
information to Sigmapharm at the September 17, 2017 meeting contained hundreds of thousands
of dollars of double counting of check payments and credit memos.<fnr173> Both RSM, Mr. Cowhey's
firm, and Rising/Aceto's litigation expert, A&M, found numerous instances of duplicate credit
memos which resulted in improper reductions against Sigmapharm's profit share.<fnr174> In fact,
A&M discovered (and Rising/Aceto reviewed) over $1.8 million dollars in duplicate and
improper credits in the second audit package.<fnr175> At trial, Mr. Hughes attributed the errors to
transactions incorrectly being entered as invoices rather than credit memos.<fnr176> Mr. Hughes
claimed the data was accurate in the general ledger, but when pulled from the system, some
invoices had negative signs creating the duplication.<fnr177> Mr. Hughes admitted he did not identify
the duplication error that A&M found in the first two iterations of the audit package (and which
Rising/Aceto removed from the third package, thereby reducing Rising/Aceto's Credit Refund
claim by that amount). Mr. Hughes also testified that no one checked the data further for other
<Page 40>
duplications.<fnr178> These many instances of duplicate and unaccounted for credit memos also
resulted in breaches of the Agreement's Audit Provisions.

<HN68><EMB>(iii) Negative Accruals</EMB>

<P20>In July of 2016, Rising/Aceto's accountants sent a letter asking Sigmapharm to confirm
the amount owed from Rising/Aceto as of June 30, 2016.<fnr179> Sigmapharm responded that it was
owed $3,429,019.09 on a cash basis; however, Rising/Aceto's final balance showed an amount
due of only $1,009,741, a difference of approximately $2.4 million.<fnr180> This gap obviously
needed to be reconciled, particularly for purposes of Rising/Aceto's profit share calculation.

<P20>Mr. Kremer testified credibly that he believed this difference was quite significant and
indicated that Rising/Aceto was actually erroneously including approximately $4 million in
chargebacks to its customers. This $4 million amount, which divided by the approximately 50%
profit share split between the parties, would roughly account for the approximate $2 million
difference between Sigmapharm's and Rising/Aceto's numbers. This deficiency again indicated
that Rising/Aceto was accounting for Sigmapharm's profit share on an accrual basis.<fnr181>

<P20>In Mr. Kremer's view, a negative accrual is improper terminology, as it is really an
adjustment or change in accruals. As was explained at trial, accruals are initially and necessarily
estimated based on historical expenses and then adjusted when the expense is actually paid.
Thus, according to Mr. Kremer, accruals should never be negative, a position with which Mr.
Hughes agreed.<fnr182> Rising/Aceto also acknowledged that millions of dollars in negative accruals
<Page 41>
would be material and raise questions for a Rising/Aceto partner.<fnr183> Mr. Kremer also credibly
testified that these large "negative accruals" led him to conclude that outside independent
accountants were needed to complete the audit.<fnr184>

<P20>Because Sigmapharm's profit share was supposed to be calculated on a cash basis, these
accrual charges, which Rising/Aceto referred to as negative accruals, were understandably
alarming to Sigmapharm. Then in 2017, when Rising/Aceto belatedly acknowledged millions of
dollars of underpayments to Sigmapharm (totaling over $9,000,000 of approximately
$12,000,000 owed) those alarms and concerns were heightened, and Sigmapharm continued to
push for its audit.<fnr185> This issue is further highlighted in CC-9, a spreadsheet created by Mr.
Kremer from Rising/Aceto data, in which Rising/Aceto showed a reduction in the accrual
balance of over $11.5 million.<fnr186> This means that Rising/Aceto "adjusted" their accruals by over
$11.5 million, which is obviously a very significant sum.

<P20>After considering these developments and what Sigmapharm viewed as the lack of a
complete or satisfactory response to Mr. Kremer's December 16 Letter, Sigmapharm's CEO, Dr.
Spireas, sent an email on May 16, 2017 to Rising/Aceto requesting a meeting because they were
arriving at "a pivotal moment" in their relationship.<fnr187> That email went on to describe the last
profit share report for Q1 2017, in which the substantial negative accruals were included, as
"very alarming and rather unacceptable."<fnr188> The parties then arranged a May 23, 2017 meeting,
<Page 42>
where Rising/Aceto, represented by Mr. Hazaray and Mr. Kaczmarek (Mr. Licata, Rising's
former CFO, had left by then), stated that:

<B24>&bull; Rising/Aceto "could very easily have had duplicate credit memos" that resulted in
"negative accruals";

<B24>&bull; outside accountants would be retained to review the Sigmapharm profit share
calculations, as well as Rising/Aceto's procedures that led to the duplicate credit
memos;

<B24>&bull; Rising/Aceto acknowledged that the negative accruals were alarming; and

<B24>&bull; Rising/Aceto would "get to the bottom of this" and that Mr. Licata had not advised
upper management of these issues.<fnr189>

<P20>At that same meeting, Mr. Hazaray also told Sigmapharm about a new "non-prod" issue
(referring to a non-product bucket where Rising/Aceto posted unallocated expenses) that would
be reviewed by the independent accounting firm they were retaining.<fnr190> Subsequently (on
January 19, 2018), Rising/Aceto's own internal auditor stated in a report that Rising "<EMBI>over the
past few years had been calculating Partner Shares incorrectly, an error which resulted in
lower than actual partner share payments.</EMBI>"<fnr191>

<P20>As will be discussed in more detail below, Rising/Aceto did retain EisnerAmper for
various purposes relating to partnership accounting, including with specific respect to
Sigmapharm. However, that independent review was never concluded and no EisnerAmper
reports were provided to Sigmapharm by Rising/Aceto at that time or at any time during the
course of this litigation. In any event, the multimillion dollar "negative accruals" booked by
Rising/Aceto, the apparent accrual based profit share reporting and calculations, the duplicate
credit memos, and the non-prod issues were all very legitimate concerns voiced by Sigmapharm
<Page 43>
and were never adequately addressed by Rising/Aceto until it was forced to do so in this
litigation. They also evidence Rising/Aceto's failure to keep accurate and complete books and
records, as well as a lack of transparency that resulted in a breach of the Agreement by
Rising/Aceto.

<HN46><EMB>(c) The "Non-Prod" Issue</EMB>

<P20>Rising/Aceto asserts that the "non-prod" issue that contributed to the multi-million dollar
FY 2017 "recast" was the result of accruals and reversals that should have been allocated to
partners (such as Sigmapharm), but were being inadvertently allocated to a "non-prod
category."<fnr192> Rising/Aceto further states that reversal transactions were improperly placed in an
"unallocated" bucket so that Sigmapharm did not receive the benefit of the reversal.<fnr193> The first
problem here appears to be that accruals were included in the Sigmapharm accounting even
though it was on a cash basis. The next problem is that the accruals had to be reversed for
Sigmapharm, but instead were placed in this unallocated "non-product" bucket that apparently
resulted in no allocation to any partner, including Sigmapharm.

<P20>This non-prod issue led to the 2017 recast which was briefly identified at the parties' May
17, 2017 meeting and then again discussed at a subsequent September 21, 2017 meeting. Shortly
before that meeting, on September 15, 2017, Rising/Aceto sent Sigmapharm a spreadsheet that
previewed the recast.<fnr194> 

<P20>In his responding email, Mr. Kremer observed that the 2017 "recast" figure was a new
one that Sigmapharm had not previously seen. He also noted that the recast number had changed
<Page 44>
from $1,120,953 to $1,399,160 and then to $1,565,440.<fnr195> Mr. Kremer understandably requested
an explanation for the changes. He did not get one.<fnr196> Instead, Mr. Hughes' response was a
summary table that was titled "FY 2017 Recast Accrual Method" that was calculated on an
accrual rather than a cash basis, as its title plainly indicates.<fnr197>

<P20>Rising/Aceto attempts to minimize the impact of these significant errors by noting that
the overall recast (which included all its partners) resulted in a total adjustment of approximately
$1.5 million. In turn, this resulted in certain partners owing Rising/Aceto money, while
Rising/Aceto owed money to others (like Sigmapharm). Rising/Aceto further argues that the $1.5
million number was a small percentage (.25%) of its overall gross sales of $600 million.<fnr198>
However, while that total "net" of the partnership recast may have been relatively small when
considered as to all Rising/Aceto's partners, the $9 million or so that was apparently not properly
allocated to Sigmapharm in one fiscal year was undeniably material to Sigmapharm. Just as
obviously, this was a very "alarming" issue that was never sufficiently or adequately explained to
Sigmapharm at any time prior the termination of the Agreement.

<P20>At trial, Mr. Hughes testified that the actual "recast" number or total adjusted amount
owed to Sigmapharm for FY 2017 was <EM>approximately $12 million,</EM> rather than the $3 million or
so Sigmapharm had been paid.<fnr199> This calculation was consistent with Mr. Hughes' internal
<Page 45>
analysis, made a month earlier, in which he determined that Rising owed Sigmapharm $11
million (ultimately increased to more than $12 million) on an accrual basis.<fnr200>

<P20>In sum, while it is true that Rising/Aceto ultimately paid the more than $12 million owed
to Sigmapharm as the result of its recast, it is also true and this Court finds that the payment was
late and based on accrual accounting. The Court also finds that the need for the "recast," which
was continually being revised upward, the non-prod issue, and the many other issues
Sigmapharm and EisnerAmper found with regard to Rising/Aceto's partnership accounting all
failed to satisfy the "transparency" and "complete and accurate" requirements of the Agreement,
resulting in its breach by Rising/Aceto.

<HN46><EMB>(d) Misleading Sigmapharm About the EisnerAmper Report Resulting in Further
Delays, Confusion and Breaches of the Agreement</EMB>

<P20>There is no dispute that Rising/Aceto repeatedly told Sigmapharm, beginning in May of
2017, that it had engaged EisnerAmper to independently audit and/or review Rising/Aceto's
partnership share accounting, including as it related to Sigmapharm.<fnr201> Notably, a May 23, 2017
internal Rising/Aceto email stated that:

<B22>We [Rising/Aceto] are in the process of engaging Eisner Amper and
Grant Thornton to review data feeds and buildup of partnership file,
and specifically look at Sigmapharm and ThinQ [another Rising/Aceto
partner on a cash basis].<fnr202>
<Page 46>

<P20>To that end, Rising/Aceto entered into (or exchanged drafts of) a series of engagement
letters with EisnerAmper to, among other things, "analyze/verify one of our partner's [December
16] audit of us (dates back to 2009 ...)."<fnr203> The work was also to include a review of
Rising/Aceto's gross-to-net process and, if necessary, to recast partnership accounting profit
share calculations.<fnr204> Another engagement letter related to developing a report specific to the
Sigmapharm relationship and the December 16, 2016 audit review.<fnr205>

<P20>EisnerAmper's work was originally to be completed in four to six weeks, <EM>i.e.,</EM> by the
middle or end of June 2017.<fnr206> Consistent with that timeline, on June 2, 2017, Rising/Aceto
confirmed to Sigmapharm that it had engaged EisnerAmper, who would "<EMBI>finish the audit</EMBI>" and
have the results to Sigmapharm in "two to three weeks."<fnr207>

<P20>Mr. Hazaray acknowledged that both Rising and Sigmapharm wanted EisnerAmper, an
independent accounting and auditing firm, to provide its "stamp of approval" on the analysis of
Rising/Aceto partnership share accounting.<fnr208> As was testified by Mr. Kremer, Rising/Aceto's
engagement of an outside, independent accounting firm to conduct that analysis was extremely
important as it would provide the independent review Sigmapharm had been seeking.<fnr209> As a
result of this commitment by Rising/Aceto, Sigmapharm decided not to engage their own
accountants.<fnr210>
<Page 47>

<P20>Despite Rising/Aceto's repeated promises, Sigmapharm never received the "stamp of
approval" both parties were seeking or any other report from EisnerAmper through Rising/Aceto
at any time before, during or after this litigation or after. In fact, Rising/Aceto produced no
discovery relating to EisnerAmper or its contemplated reports. As a result, Sigmapharm was
required to subpoena those documents from EisnerAmper itself, which produced many
documents relating to its work for Rising/Aceto in these regards, including specifically its
relationship with Sigmapharm.<fnr211>

<P20>Sigmapharm (through Mr. Kremer) followed up frequently as to the status of the
EisnerAmper report and was repeatedly told that EisnerAmper was working on it, but needed
more time.<fnr212> When Mr. Kremer followed up on June 27, 2017,<fnr213> Mr. Hazaray said "another
seven to ten days" were needed "for [EisnerAmper] to complete their study."<fnr214> On July 6, 2017,
the date was again pushed back to the "end of July to complete the study and respond to all open
items."<fnr215> At the end of July, after another follow-up, Mr. Hazaray reported that progress was
being made with EisnerAmper, but that they "are a bit away from the final conclusions."<fnr216> On
September 6, 2017, Mr. Kremer followed up again, but no EisnerAmper report was
forthcoming.<fnr217>

<P20>Relatedly, in an August 14 email, Mr. Kremer also asked when Sigmapharm could expect
to receive the 2017 Second Quarter profit share payment.<fnr218> Mr. Kremer followed up again on
<Page 48>
August 22. On August 25, Mr. Hughes responded that Mr. Kaczmarek had verbally promised
Sigmapharm that Rising/Aceto would wire an advance of $2.5 million while they "finalize our
analysis."<fnr219> Tellingly, during this time period, Rising/Aceto executives emailed each other
internally.<fnr220> Mr. Hazaray stated to Messrs. Kaczmarek, Hughes, CEO Sal Guccione and Mr.
Roth that:

<B22>I am a bit skeptical about sending out new statements and checks <EMBI>without
accompanying it with an Eisner report</EMBI> (unless Eisner is going to take another
2-3 weeks to deliver these reports) I think we should follow up with John and
get an expedited timeline commitment for key partners (Sigma, ThinQ, Biopharm).
Also, as regards Sigma Pharm, we need to address the outstanding issues that they
had raised after their audit. Eugene, do you have all the data you require from
Rick yet?<fnr221>

<P20>At some point during or after this time period, Rising/Aceto apparently determined that it
would not proceed with the EisnerAmper report or audit and that it would instead be handled
internally by them working with EisnerAmper. Rising/Aceto did not advise Sigmapharm of this
significant change in direction for months, at least. At trial, Mr. Hughes, who joined
Rising/Aceto in July of 2017, and Mr. Hazaray attempted to explain this undisclosed material
change by testifying they did not proceed with the audit or review because it would involve
"agreed upon procedures" that would require EisnerAmper to go to Rising/Aceto's customers;
the cost of the audit; and because only a few partners were interested but none of this was
conveyed to Sigmapharm. Another excuse was that Sigmapharm terminated the Agreement.<fnr222>
But that termination occurred in March of 2018, long after the decision not to provide any
EisnerAmper report to Sigmapharm was made.
<Page 49>

<P20>Neither Mr. Hughes nor Mr. Hazaray was able to say who at Rising/Aceto made the
determination not to proceed with the EisnerAmper audit or report.<fnr223> Nor did anyone at
Rising/Aceto recall advising Sigmapharm of its decision or its reasoning, according to the
testimony of Messrs. Hughes and Hazaray.<fnr224> In response, Rising/Aceto could only argue that the
switch should have been obvious based on the use of certain pronouns and their indication that
Mr. Hazaray was going to "spearhead the review of the audit results letter."<fnr225> The Court
disagrees. As noted above, Rising/Aceto made numerous statements that EisnerAmper was
proceeding with the audit/review in the context of advising Sigmapharm when EisnerAmper
would complete its work. The emails in no way state or even suggest, explicitly or implicitly, that
EisnerAmper was no longer preparing or providing to Sigmapharm a report relating to
Rising/Aceto's profit share accounting for Sigmapharm. Rising/Aceto financial employees
would be necessarily and understandably involved in the preparation of any such report, but that
certainly does not mean that EisnerAmper would not be issuing any report.

<P20>Although the Court generally found Mr. Hughes' testimony to be credible and detailed,
his inability to answer who made this decision with such an "important" customer at this crucial
phase of the parties' relationship was not convincing.<fnr226> As for Mr. Hazaray, his testimony on this
point was simply not credible or consistent, as he explicitly referred to EisnerAmper's work as
an "audit" and also stated, for example, that EisnerAmper was being hired by Rising/Aceto to
obtain its "stamp of approval." Obviously, that "stamp of approval" would provide the
<Page 50>
independence and comfort Sigmapharm was requesting. It would also avoid the need for
Sigmapharm to proceed with its own independent audit, which this Court finds Rising/Aceto was
seeking to avoid (and delay) whenever possible.

<P20>Further, as noted above, despite EisnerAmper's extensive involvement with these issues,
and Sigmapharm's requests for discovery relating to EisnerAmper, Rising/Aceto did not produce
in this litigation any report, emails or any other documentation involving EisnerAmper, even
though emails and reports (in draft form or otherwise) obviously existed.<fnr227> In sharp contrast,
EisnerAmper produced various and numerous documents in response to Sigmapharm's
subpoena, including at least one report regarding Rising/Aceto's gross-to-net process that was
apparently never finalized (the "Eisner Report").<fnr228>

<P20>Significantly, the Eisner Report that was produced, whether or not provided to
Rising/Aceto or Sigmapharm, was critical of various aspects of Rising/Aceto's "Gross to Net and
Partnership Payment Process," among many other things.<fnr229> The Eisner Report also noted
inconsistent allocation of gross-to-net deductions at the SKU level; inadequate review of
partnership payable process results, with significant variances and inadequate explanations for
"significant swings;" many inefficiencies, including manual undertakings that yielded
inconsistent results; and insufficient accounting software, to name a few.<fnr230>
<Page 51>

<P20>Rising/Aceto also makes much of the fact that the engagements contemplated by various
engagement letters that were produced by EisnerAmper were never completed. But that was
between Rising/Aceto and EisnerAmper. None of that was known by (or disclosed to)
Sigmapharm. Rising/Aceto also argues that it never said EisnerAmper was going to "audit"
anything<fnr231> &mdash; apparently attempting to draw a fine distinction between an audit and a review or
other analysis. However, that ignores the testimony and statements of its own officers that
specifically referred to EisnerAmper's work as an "audit" and/or "review" that EisnerAmper was
performing to independently analyze Rising/Aceto's partnership accounting, including as it
related to Sigmapharm and the December 16 Letter. It similarly ignores the essentially unrefuted
evidence showing that Rising/Aceto was going to provide the results of the analysis to
Sigmapharm, along with its "stamp of approval." That never happened.

<P20>Finally, Rising/Aceto also argues that EisnerAmper's work in support of the profit share
analysis and muti-million dollar "recast" was included in the information Rising/Aceto
ultimately provided through Messrs. Hughes and Hazaray. But that argument misses the point, as
it does not provide the independent "stamp of approval" that Rising/Aceto knew Sigmapharm
was looking for.

<P20>In sum, the Court finds that Rising/Aceto repeatedly represented that Sigmapharm would
be provided with a report and/or audit from EisnerAmper that independently analyzed its
partnership accounting with Sigmapharm and the December 16 Letter. It did not do so. This
course of conduct is the opposite of transparency and the maintenance of records that are readily
available for independent audit purposes. Instead, it is delay, deception, and the active
withholding of information which resulted in Sigmapharm being unable to conduct the
<Page 52>
independent audit it was entitled to until this Court ordered Rising/Aceto to provide it in this
litigation &mdash; years after Sigmapharm's repeated requests for that audit.<fnr232> This is another breach of
the Agreement.

<HN46><EMB>(e) Rising/Aceto's Failure to Provide Cash Basis Profit Share Reports to
Sigmapharm</EMB>

<P20>Besides the difficulties maintaining two sets of books would generally create, the
difficulties Rising/Aceto encountered in attempting to do so were particularly acute because
Rising/Aceto's systems could not accommodate maintaining its books on both a cash and accrual
basis. In an August 17, 2017 email to his CEO, COO and Aceto's CFO, Mr. Hughes, then
Rising/Aceto's Senior VP of Finance, confirmed that Sigmapharm was on a cash basis, and that
Rising/Aceto was not able to produce accurate cash basis reports because of deficiencies in its
accounting systems, stating as follows:

<B22>Sigmapharm is on the cash basis, not the accrual basis as most of the other partners
are. A big driver for the issues and difficulties for this account is the fact that Sigma-pharm
has elected and as I understand has not wanted to migrate away from being on
the cash basis. This causes finance to maintain two sets of books and <EM>our systems are
not able to handle this.</EM><fnr233>

<P20>Thus, to the extent that Rising/Aceto argues that the Agreement did not provide for cash
accountings, the Court disagrees. Both sides acknowledged and agreed that Sigmapharm was on
a cash basis. Even if it were not part of the Agreement, the parties' course of conduct and
testimony confirmed that Sigmapharm's profit share accounting was to be calculated on a cash
basis.<fnr234> Further, while Rising/Aceto asserts that it provided a sufficient cash basis accounting to
<Page 53>
Sigmapharm for Audit Period I, it also at least indirectly acknowledges that it did not provide a
cash basis accounting to Sigmapharm for Audit Period II until at least January of 2022.<fnr235> But
even that was years late &mdash; nearly four years after Sigmapharm terminated the relationship (albeit
wrongfully). In any event, and as noted, Mr. Hughes and others at Rising/Aceto acknowledged
that it was unable to accurately account for the parties' relationship on a cash basis in performing
the 2017 recast or otherwise.

<P20>In fact, and contrary to Rising/Aceto's arguments, Mr. Hughes admitted that the cash
basis Profit Share Statements Rising/Aceto sent to Sigmapharm while the Agreement was in
effect were wrong.<fnr236> Mr. Hughes also acknowledged it would be "very difficult" to verify the
prior allegedly cash based accounting after the fact, due to the insufficient capacity of
Rising/Aceto's accounting systems, which led to "a lot of errors."<fnr237> Then, even though
Rising/Aceto argues that it provided a cash basis accounting to Sigmapharm in 2017, the report
Rising/Aceto delivered to Sigmapharm describing its multimillion dollar "recast" of
Sigmapharm's profit share is titled "FY 2017 Recast <EMB>Accrual</EMB> Method," confirming that this
report was prepared on an accrual basis.<fnr238> During his trial testimony, Mr. Hughes also admitted
that even at the time of trial Rising/Aceto did not know what they owed Sigmapharm in FY 2017
on a cash basis and that it did not perform that calculation because it would require a "large
<Page 54>
effort."<fnr239> The Court thus rejects Rising/Aceto's argument that it provided the cash basis Profit
Share Reports to Sigmapharm that were required by the Agreement.

<P20>Finally, the Court also rejects Rising/Aceto's argument that it provided Sigmapharm with
the underlying data with which Sigmapharm could have performed its own profit-share
accounting on a cash basis. Providing that underlying data and performing the profit share
accounting were Rising/Aceto's obligations under the Agreement. It failed to provide that
accounting, resulting in yet another breach of the Agreement while the parties' relationship was
ongoing.

<P20>In sum, the Court finds that Rising/Aceto did not provide Sigmapharm with the cash
basis reporting that both parties acknowledge was required under the Agreement, principally
because it was unable or unwilling to do so.

<HN24><EMB>2. The "Audit Packages" Did Not Satisfy Rising/Aceto's Obligations Under the
Agreement</EMB>

<P20>In this case, Rising/Aceto often referred to the packages of information it provided to
Sigmapharm during Audit Period II in January 2019, May 2020 and January 2022 (after the
termination of the Agreement) as "audit packages."<fnr240> The Court intentionally places the words
"audit packages" in quotation marks because these packages of information are not and were not
complete audits, as contemplated by the Agreement or Sigmapharm. In other words, calling
something an "audit package" does not make it an audit or, more precisely, sufficient to
constitute all the information required for an audit.
<Page 55>

<P20>Rising/Aceto argues that in the arbitration, Sigmapharm requested and Rising/Aceto
agreed to provide Sigmapharm with an audit in the form of Rising/Aceto's own detailed review
of its profit share calculations for Audit Period II based on the information Rising/Aceto
provided.<fnr241> But, once again, that is not an audit, and certainly not an independent one, as the
Agreement permitted and Sigmapharm requested. Instead, it is an initial compilation of data
from which the audit process may begin. And, of course, the data was compiled by Rising/Aceto,
without any input from Sigmapharm or other third party. Additionally, the fact that Rising/Aceto
may have prepared similar "packages" for other partner audits<fnr242> does not mean that this
package was sufficient under the Agreement or for Sigmapharm's purposes, which included the
right to conduct an independent audit. As noted, Rising/Aceto did not provide that independent
audit until ordered to do so by this Court.

<P20>In fact, based on the numerous delays and substantive issues that had occurred by the
time of the parties' November 17, 2017 meeting, and the delay in responding to Sigmapharm's
follow-up information requests, Sigmapharm had determined to engage an independent audit
firm, RSM, LLP ("RSM"), where Mr. Cowhey was a member, to assist Sigmapharm in
proceeding with an audit. As Mr. Kremer testified, that audit would have included additional
information requests, sampling selections, and on-site visits.<fnr243> Consistent with that
contemplated audit, Mr. Kremer's January 12, 2018 follow up information request described
"additional information to be received prior to SPL visiting Rising and performing an <EM>on-site</EM>
<Page 56>
<EM>audit</EM> of physical documents."<fnr244> Sigmapharm's November 14, 2017 and January 12, 2018
information requests described what information Sigmapharm was looking for to proceed with
its audit.<fnr245> Mr. Hughes, who admitted he was dealing with various other pressing issues at the
time, acknowledged that Sigmapharm did not receive the information described in the January
12, 2018 information request.<fnr246>

<P20>Relatedly, on February 16, 2018, Sigmapharm notified Rising/Aceto that the Fourth
Quarter 2018 profit share payment was late and that it had still not received a response to the
November 17, 2017 and January 12, 2018 Information Requests.<fnr247> Rising/Aceto made a
payment the next day. However, Rising/Aceto realized almost immediately that it had made a
$262,000 error in that payment and another $319,000 error in the 2017 Third Quarter payment.<fnr248>
Then, on February 17, 2018, Rising/Aceto emailed another summary profit share calculation that
added exactly $500,000 to a previous $1,392,293 calculation for the same period, increasing it to
$1,892,293.<fnr249> That number then changed <EM>again</EM> to $2,211,764.<fnr250> Mr. Kremer summarized his
frustrations with the ever changing and often unsupported numbers as follows:

<B22>That's how they made their calculations. They would make calculations, they
would change them, they would modify them. I never received reconciliations
from one to the next. That seems like a repeat theme which is why we wanted
an audit, which is why we wanted to see all of the figures, which is why we
wanted to make sure that we had all of the data so that we could then create
sample testing, go onsite, look at hard copy evidence and all the normal things
<Page 57>
that one would do in an audit.<fnr251>

<P20>The Court agrees that Rising/Aceto's ever-changing numbers (and financial department
personnel) amply demonstrated the need for a full-fledged audit of Audit Period II &mdash; not an
"audit package" prepared by Rising/Aceto that was not independently reviewed by an auditor
and tested through appropriate protocols and procedures. Thus, although admissible as evidence
(as the Court finds in the next section), the "audit packages" did not satisfy Rising/Aceto's
document production obligations under the Agreement's Audit Provisions. Those packages may
be the beginning but are certainly not the end of a process that would include further agreements
on samplings, protocols, and the like.

<P20>Finally, and as previously noted, Rising/Aceto resisted Sigmapharm's repeated efforts to
obtain that independent audit through litigation in the District Court, the subsequent arbitration
proceeding, and this litigation. Even then, Rising/Aceto did not allow the audit by Sigmapharm
until it was ordered to so by this Court in June of 2021,<fnr252> almost four years after Sigmapharm's
multimillion dollar "recast" in 2017. Thus, Sigmapharm was unnecessarily required to go to
great lengths to obtain the independent audit specifically permitted under the Agreement,
resulting in its breach.

<HN24><EMB>3. The Audit Packages/Profit Share Reports Prepared by Rising/Aceto Are Admissible
Evidence</EMB>

<P20>Rising/Aceto delivered three (3) post-termination Profit Share Reports (also called audit
packages by Rising/Aceto from time to time).<fnr253> The first was in January 2019, before the
<Page 58>
Chapter 11 case was filed (in February 2019), but after the Agreement was wrongfully
terminated by Sigmapharm in March of 2018, and covered the period from April 1, 2016 (the
start of Audit Period II) to December 31, 2018.<fnr254> This document and the next two audit
packages were prepared by Mr. Hughes and his team at Rising/Aceto.<fnr255>

<P20>The second audit package was prepared and delivered to Sigmapharm in May 2020.<fnr256> As
Rising/Aceto's customers continued to take credits against prior sales of Products, this updated
document included transactions from January 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020.<fnr257> The third and final
"package" from Rising/Aceto's point of view was provided and then delivered to Sigmapharm in
January 2022.<fnr258> This last document removed transactions that were "inadvertently coded in the
earlier version as a credit rather than a debit."<fnr259> Rising/Aceto represents that a relatively small
percentage of transactions (72 transactions out of thousands) were required to be recoded.<fnr260>

<P20>Of course, the need to recode credits as debits is further evidence of the problems with
Rising/Aceto's bookkeeping; however, according to Rising/Aceto, these corrections resulted in a
<EM>reduction</EM> in the amount Sigmapharm owed Rising/Aceto of approximately $900,000.<fnr261> Thus,
this also represents a later correction of Rising/Aceto errors years after the Agreement terminated
and the necessary updating of the records produced by the Debtors during the course of this
litigation. Second, Rising/Aceto removed from the January 2022 "package" all transactions after
the Shore Suven closing on April 19, 2019. Rising/Aceto states that it did so because these
<Page 59>
transactions were processed and addressed (but not necessarily fully paid for) by Shore Suven
after the closing. Those also necessarily reduced the amount due Sigmapharm.

<P20>As Mr. Hughes testified at trial, he and his team were responsible for all accounting
audits and profit share accountings at Rising/Aceto.<fnr262> These audits/accountings included the
preparation of profit share or audit packages for all Rising/Aceto partners requesting or entitled
to them.<fnr263> Mr. Hughes testified that he utilized Rising/Aceto's business records, principally in
the form of electronic data that was entered into Excel spreadsheets with thousands of rows and
multiple columns reflecting individual transactions. Those transactions were then aggregated into
a summary spreadsheet.<fnr264> Mr. Kremer prepared his summary spreadsheets for Audit Period I in
the same fashion.<fnr265>

<P20>Sigmapharm claims these profit share or quarterly statements or audit packages are
inadmissible hearsay and "litigation tools."<fnr266> The Court disagrees and finds that they are
admissible as business records maintained by Rising/Aceto in the ordinary course. By Order and
Opinion entered on November 22, 2022,<fnr267> this Court preliminarily denied, without prejudice,
Sigmapharm's Motion <EM>In Limine</EM> to Preclude Rising-Aceto's "Audit Packages."<fnr268> The Court
deferred its final ruling on this issue until trial based principally on the substantial precedent to
the effect that the determination of admissibility of business records should await trial.<fnr269> Now
<Page 60>
that trial has occurred, the Court will deny Sigmapharm's Motion to Preclude with prejudice, as
the Court finds that the audit packages/Profit Share Statements are admissible as unquestionably
relevant "business records" under FRE 803(6) and as "summaries to prove content" under FRE
1006.<fnr270>

<P20>As was noted above and as was testified competently and candidly by Mr. Hughes, he
and his team prepared the "audit packages" in the regular course of business using
Rising/Aceto's business records maintained substantially contemporaneously and in the same
normal course of business. The packages included a master or lead sheet summarizing the
underlying information that included the profit and loss calculations shown in the Profit Share
Statement<fnr271> and an additional eight spreadsheets with the underlying transactional data
supporting the master spreadsheet.<fnr272> This was the same kind of transactional level detail
Sigmapharm requested &mdash; and was satisfied with &mdash; as part of its audit of Audit Period I.<fnr273>

<P20>At trial, Mr. Hughes explained in detail how the package was created using mostly
electronic data derived from Rising/Aceto's accounting systems that were maintained and
utilized in the normal course of Rising/Aceto's business<fnr274> and from various other sources also
maintained in the ordinary course of its business.<fnr275> He further testified as to how gross-to-net
deductions were treated and managed in Rising/Aceto's accounting systems in the normal
<Page 61>
course.<fnr276> These packages included hundreds of thousands of rows of individual transactions.<fnr277>
The audit packages or Profit Share Statements are therefore admissible as business records.

<P20>As to the lead sheets summarizing this extremely voluminous data in the Profit Share
Reports, the Court finds those were also prepared in the normal course.<fnr278> In this Court's view,
this summary was not only appropriate, but also necessary based on the extremely voluminous
data being presented. Accordingly, the summary information in the packages is also admissible
under FRE 1006.

<P20>As to the business records exception and summary rule, and Court's ruling that the
packages are admissible as such, the Court relies on Mr. Hughes' essentially (or completely)
unrebutted testimony and cases such as <EM>United States v. Leo</EM><fnr279> in which the Third Circuit held
that summaries of data prepared in connection with an audit are admissible as business records,
and <EM>United States v. Blackwell</EM><fnr280> in which the District Court found that a company's audit was
admissible as business record, even though it was part of an investigative report.

<P20>The Court also rejects Sigmapharm's argument that the audit packages are inadmissible
because they were prepared after the litigation started (in 2018 in District Court, then moved to
arbitration, and finally this adversary proceeding). There is no such rule and, if there were, it
<Page 62>
would render a party such as Rising/Aceto, which was out of business but still involved in
litigation, unable to prove damages because the underlying Agreement was terminated
(wrongfully, as the Court has held) and the breaching party (Sigmapharm) commenced litigation.
That would not be fair or appropriate in this Court's view. As the Third Circuit held in <EM>United
States v. Casoni,</EM> FRE 803(6) itself does not limit the admissibility of business records to those
prepared before litigation begins.<fnr281>

<P20>In sum, Rising/Aceto satisfied its burden of showing at trial that the audit packages/Profit
Share Reports were admissible as business records, with the lead sheets also admissible as
business records and summaries. Thus, <EM>Sigmapharm's Motion In Limine To Preclude Rising-Aceto's
"Audit Packages"</EM><fnr282> is now dismissed with prejudice. To the extent not waived,
<EM>Sigmapharm's Motion In Limine To Preclude Documents Rising-Aceto Created Post-Litigation</EM><fnr283>
is now also denied with prejudice.

<HN24><EMB>4. The Remaining In Limine Motions Are Also Denied With Prejudice</EMB>

<P20>The parties made several other <EM>in limine</EM> motion that the Court denied without prejudice
pending trial. They include: (i) <EM>Plaintiffs' Motion In Limine To Exclude Video Recording Of
Deposition Of Plaintiffs' Expert (the "Exclude Video Motion");</EM><fnr284> (ii) <EM>Sigmapharm's Motion In
Limine To Preclude Evidence Of "Lost Profits" After Rising-Aceto Rejected The Master
Agreement And Sold Its Assets To Shore Suven</EM> (the "Preclude Evidence of Lost Profits
Motion");<fnr285> and (iii) <EM>Sigmapharm's Motion For Sanctions For Spoliation Of Evidence And For</EM>
<Page 63>
<EM>An Evidentiary Hearing</EM> (the "Spoliation Motion").<fnr286> Except for the Spoliation Motion, the
parties did not press these motions at trial or in their post-trial submissions; therefore, any further
challenge based on these motions is waived.<fnr287> Even if not waived, the Court will also deny these
motions on the merits.

<P20>As to Plaintiffs' Exclude Video Motion, neither party sought to use that video testimony
at trial. Therefore, that motion is now moot. As to Sigmapharm's Preclude Evidence of Lost
Profits Motion, the Court has determined not to award Lost Profits to Sigmapharm for the
reasons stated in this Opinion. Therefore, that Motion is also moot. However, the Court also
found that the evidence of Lost Profits submitted by Rising/Aceto was admissible; therefore, the
to the extent the Lost Profits Motion sought to exclude this evidence, it is denied.

<P20>As to Sigmapharm's Spoliation Motion, Sigmapharm argues that while Rising/Aceto may
not have destroyed evidence, it failed to retain certain evidence relating to its return transactions
and did not produce the "large partnership files" referred to earlier or its general ledger.<fnr288> As to
the return transactions, Rising/Aceto admittedly was able to recover only three years of records.
However, there was no evidence of destruction of the prior years' records. Further, as this Court
previously found, those returns were amply supported by other records Rising/Aceto did retain
and produce.
<Page 64>

<P20>Central to a finding of spoliation is a determination that a party acted in bad faith.<fnr289>
Here, there was no showing at trial of bad faith or even gross recklessness by Rising/Aceto
relating to these documents. In fact, as Rising/Aceto notes, the general ledger that was produced
confirmed its profit share calculations. Further, these categories of information were objected to
by Rising/Aceto during trial and were not made the subject of a motion to compel by
Sigmapharm. Thus, the bad faith element is missing as Sigmapharm could have made that
motion. And finally, the Court has found Rising/Aceto in breach of the Agreement for failure to
preserve documentation such as the large partnership files and denied Rising/Aceto's Lost Profits
claims based on that breach. In this Court's view, that is the appropriate remedy for
Rising/Aceto's failure to produce documentation it was required to produce pursuant to the
Agreement.

<HN24><EMB>5. Rising/Aceto Ultimately Provided Sigmapharm With All the Information It
Requested or Required for Audit Period I</EMB>

<P20>For the reasons stated in the Factual Background, this Court determines that Rising/Aceto
answered in full, or at least sufficiently, all of the requests made in Mr. Kremer's December 4,
2015 letter. As noted, this information allowed Mr. Kremer to prepare his detailed December 16
Letter describing Sigmapharm's claims against Rising/Aceto and describing the additional
information he requested. Thus, the Court disagrees with Sigmapharm's assertions that it never
concluded its audit of Audit Period I or that Rising/Aceto failed to provide Sigmapharm with the
information it requested for that period. As to the latter argument, Mr. Kremer was forced to
acknowledge on cross-examination that he was provided with all the information he requested in
his December 4, 2015 audit request.<fnr290> Thus, as previously stated, while Mr. Kremer referred to
<Page 65>
the data produced by Rising/Aceto on March 16, 2016 as "grossly inadequate" and
"incomplete,"<fnr291> Rising/Aceto corrected those deficiencies over the next three months.

<P20>The proofs at trial and Sigmapharm's subsequent activity further support the conclusion
that Sigmapharm was provided with the information it requested (or required) to complete its
audit for Audit Period I. First, with this information, Mr. Kremer was able to prepare his
December 16 Letter which he called an "Audit Results Letter" and noted that he had
"concluded" his review of the information provided.<fnr292> Additionally, Mr. Kremer referred to the
information contained in the latest Audit Period I "spreadsheets" as the standard by which
Rising/Aceto should provide future information and which allowed Mr. Kremer to preface his
own cumulative spreadsheets.<fnr293> Finally, Mr. Cowhey's sampling requests and expert opinions
were limited to Audit Period II.<fnr294> This limitation at least implicitly confirms that the audit of
Audit Period I was complete.

<P20>In sum, the record reveals that Sigmapharm did ultimately receive the information it
requested or required for Audit Period I, albeit only after Mr. Kremer repeatedly followed up on
prior requests that had not been fully answered and many months had passed. As to Audit Period
II, however, Sigmapharm requested an independent audit, but as previously noted, that was never
provided to Sigmapharm until Rising/Aceto was ordered to do so by this Court.

<HN02><EMB>B. The Long-Delayed Audit of Audit Period II</EMB>

<HN24><EMB>1. Sigmapharm's Expert, Mr. Cowhey</EMB>
<Page 66>

<P20>Sigmapharm retained Mr. Cowhey, of the RSM firm, to conduct the court-ordered audit
of Audit Period II. Mr. Cowhey is not a CPA, but has been retained as an expert in similar
matters many times and has extensive experience in conducting similar audits. Initially, the Court
notes that Rising/Aceto seems to challenge Mr. Cowhey's expert qualifications, but stops short of
actually doing so. Nor did Rising/Aceto move to preclude his proposed expert testimony as to the
audit or otherwise disqualify him.<fnr295> The Court will not credit this implicit argument and will
consider Mr. Cowhey's testimony as to the audit his firm conducted.

<P20>Rising/Aceto also challenges Mr. Cowhey's independence. This is significant for various
reasons, including that the Agreement allows for an "independent audit." Rising/Aceto's
challenge is based at least in part on Mr. Cowhey's testimony that he participated in privileged
strategy sessions with legal counsel as early as November 2017, which was four months before
Sigmapharm improperly terminated the Agreement and began the District Court litigation.<fnr296>
Further, he was hired by counsel, not Sigmapharm directly. The Court agrees that this pre-litigation
involvement causes concerns about Mr. Cowhey's independence and has considered
this involvement in evaluating Mr. Cowhey's opinions. With this background, the Court will
analyze Mr. Cowhey's audit and related testimony as to Audit Period II.

<HN24><EMB>2. Audit Protocol and Sampling Requests</EMB>

<P20>Following the entry of the Audit Order, Rising/Aceto continued its efforts to collect and
produce the information identified by Sigmapharm and also sent subpoenas to its customers.<fnr297>
<Page 67>
Sigmapharm did not make any supplemental document requests or sampling requests after the
entry of the Audit Order.<fnr298>

<P20>On June 10, 2020, Sigmapharm served its Audit Protocol, through which Mr. Cowhey
sought to sample transactions in the audit package.<fnr299> The Audit Protocol and sampling requests
were limited to Audit Period II.<fnr300> It identified 393 transactions to test from six categories of
gross-to-net deductions (<EM>i.e.,</EM> chargebacks, CMS, rebates, returns, product costs, and Rising
Fee).<fnr301> Cowhey later added an additional category seeking three credit memos from Audit
Period I.<fnr302> He determined not to audit sales for reasons that are not clear to the Court.<fnr303> In any
event, the audit proceeded. On October 1, 2020, Sigmapharm identified the specific transactions
it wished to sample for its audit.<fnr304> Sigmapharm did not send any formal document requests with
its sampling requests; however, in an email from counsel, Sigmapharm indicated that the support
"may take the form of original source documents, contracts, screenshots from iContracts, etc."<fnr305>

<P20>By this time, Rising/Aceto was no longer operating. Therefore, Rising/Aceto engaged
A&M, including Ms. Ryan and her staff, all of whom were CPAs, to address the sampling
requests.<fnr306> Mr. Hughes assisted in the process.<fnr307> Both A&M and Mr. Hughes were involved in
responding to the sample requests by collecting documents, including third-party documents
<Page 68>
(some of which were obtained by subpoena), and reviewing other information relating to the
sampling transactions to determine whether they could be validated.<fnr308>

<HN46><EMB>(a) Rising/Aceto Reasonably Validated All the Sampling Transactions</EMB>

<HN68><EMB>(i) Independent Audits Look for Reasonable Assurance that a Transaction
Occurred, Not Perfection</EMB>

<P20>When conducting an audit under a contract like the Agreement, parties normally agree
upon the governing procedures and documents that will be produced to support samples.<fnr309> In
this case, that happened only after the Audit Order was entered, although perhaps without all the
details and protocols that would typically be agreed upon in this type of audit.<fnr310> As a result, the
parties and the Court look to the applicable professional accounting standards to evaluate the
audit.

<P20>In the absence of an agreement, CPAs operate under the consulting standards
promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA"), which
require auditors to obtain "sufficient relevant data to afford a reasonable basis" for opinions.<fnr311>
Mr. Cowhey testified he was applying a standard similar to Generally Accepted Auditing
Standards ("GAAS") for audits, under which auditors look for "reasonable assurance."<fnr312> As
both Mr. Cowhey and Ms. Ryan testified, the standard in either case is one of reasonableness, not
perfection.<fnr313> The GAAS guidelines provide that "`[r]easonable assurance is not an absolute level
of assurance,'" with "`most of the audit evidence on which the auditor draws conclusions and
<Page 69>
bases the auditor's opinion being persuasive rather than conclusive.'"<fnr314> Given these standards,
the ultimate goal of the sampling process is to "reasonably validate that the sample transactions,
the sample credits, actually occurred[.]"<fnr315> Mr. Cowhey advanced a similar conclusion, saying he
wanted to "verify the transaction occurred."<fnr316>

<HN68><EMB>(ii) Rising/Aceto Reasonably Validated the Sampling Transactions</EMB>

<P20>Through Ms. Ryan and Mr. Hughes, Rising/Aceto provided substantial evidence in
various forms that the Court finds were more than sufficient to reasonably validate the sampling
transactions.<fnr317> Mr. Hughes helped Rising/Aceto prepare the demonstrative exhibit that identified
the supporting documents for the sample requests (the "Audit Demonstrative") and confirmed its
accuracy.<fnr318> Ms. Ryan prepared graphic charts regarding the samples.<fnr319>

<P20>Ms. Ryan and Mr. Hughes provided substantial testimony based on various forms of
supporting evidence that validated the seven categories of sampling transactions.
Notwithstanding the legitimate issues Mr. Cowhey raised about things like duplicative or
negative credit memos and negative accruals, Mr. Cowhey acknowledged that Rising/Aceto
validated four of the seven categories of deductions he sampled, specifically CMS rebates, Cost
of Goods, Rising's Fee, and credit memos from Audit Period I (admitting those credits were
properly billed during Audit Period I).<fnr320> Thus, there is no need for the Court to further analyze
those categories of credits or their validity.

<HN68><EMB>(iii) Rising/Aceto Reasonably Validated the Remaining Three Categories &mdash;
Chargebacks, Rebates, and Returns &mdash; that Mr. Cowhey Challenged</EMB>
<Page 70>

<HN46><EMB>(a) Chargebacks</EMB>

<P20>To identify documents to reasonably support a transaction, auditors consider the
processes employed by the company and documentation maintained in the ordinary course of
business.<fnr321> Chargebacks came into Rising/Aceto daily through a process that was mostly
electronic from start to finish.<fnr322> Rising/Aceto's transactions with the Big 3 wholesalers
(McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and Cardinal Health) were conducted
via Electronic Data Interchange ("EDI"), which was often the primary or exclusive evidence of
a transaction.<fnr323>

<P20>Customers made chargeback claims to Rising/Aceto directly via an EDI feed into
iContracts, which validated the claim.<fnr324> Once validated, Rising/Aceto sent a credit memo to the
customer via EDI feed.<fnr325> The EDI feeds are strictly electronic data.<fnr326> Additionally, chargebacks
were paid when the customer deducted those charges from payments; no check was issued.<fnr327>
When customers remitted monies to Rising/Aceto, they included Excel spreadsheets that
identified the gross-to-net charges (<EM>e.g.,</EM> chargebacks, rebates, etc.) that were being deducted
from the payment ("Cash Application Documents").<fnr328> Some customers, including McKesson,
uploaded Cash Application Documents to their portal, allowing Rising/Aceto to download and
save them onto its network.<fnr329>
<Page 71>

<P20>Using chargebacks sample number 1 as an example, Rising/Aceto produced internal and
third-party documents to support the essential components of the charge and process, including
documents proving the following facts:

<B22>a. <EMU>The customer requested the chargeback</EMU>. This was demonstrated by extracts from
iContracts with EDI data showing the customer's chargeback claim ("iContract
Reports").<fnr330> Mr. Cowhey admitted that iContract Reports are third-party
documents that consist of EDI data.<fnr331>

<B22>b. <EMU>The chargeback amount was accurate</EMU>. This was shown by pricing documents with
customers.<fnr332> These also are third-party documents.<fnr333> Rising/Aceto also provided
iContracts historical pricing tables that confirmed the accuracy of the
information.<fnr334>

<B22>c. <EMU>Rising/Aceto validated and authorized the chargeback</EMU>. This was shown by credit
memos that also confirmed the accuracy of the information.<fnr335>

<B22>d. <EMU>The customer deducted the chargeback from payments made to Rising/Aceto</EMU>.
This was shown by Cash Application Documents.<fnr336> Mr. Cowhey acknowledged
that a Cash Application Document for a sample evidences the customer deducting
charges.<fnr337>

<B22>e. <EMU>Rising/Aceto's general ledger also confirmed the transaction</EMU>. After this Court
ordered their production, Rising/Aceto also produced general ledgers to
corroborate that the chargebacks were requested, validated, and given.<fnr338>

<P20>Additionally, Rising/Aceto demonstrated that certain documents produced directly from
the customers in response to subpoenas, which are third-party documents, supported the validity
<Page 72>
of the credit.<fnr339> This same level of overall proofs, or substantially similar proofs, were provided
by Rising/Aceto as to each of the chargeback and other transactions tested through the audit. The
Court is satisfied that these proofs provided reasonable assurances that the transactions occurred
as reported by Rising/Aceto.

<HN46><EMB>(b) Rebates</EMB>

<P20>To make a rebate claim, Rising/Aceto's customers sent invoices.<fnr340> Some customers sent
invoices by email (<EM>e.g.,</EM> AmerisourceBergen), while others uploaded invoices into a portal (<EM>e.g.,</EM>
McKesson and Cardinal).<fnr341> The invoices usually included a summary document in PDF format
and an itemization of charges in Excel format.<fnr342> Once validated, Rising/Aceto authorized a
credit via a credit memo.<fnr343> Customers generally deducted rebate charges from payments.<fnr344>
Here, Rising/Aceto again produced internal and third-party documents to support the essential
components of this process, as illustrated by the Audit Demonstrative.

<P20>Using rebate sample number 1 as an example,<fnr345> Rising/Aceto produced documents
proving the following facts:

<B24>a. <EMU>The customer made the rebate claim</EMU>. This was shown by the invoice from the
customer.<fnr346> This is a third-party document. Mr. Cowhey admitted customer invoices
and the Excel support are third-party evidence of the customer claiming rebates.<fnr347>

<B24>b. <EMU>The accuracy of the rebate price calculation</EMU>. This derives from the contract with the
customer.<fnr348> This is also a third-party document.<fnr349> Rising/Aceto also provided the
<Page 73>
iContracts Rebate Master Report to confirm the transactions.<fnr350>

<B24>c. <EMU>Rising/Aceto validated and authorized the customer to take the rebate</EMU>. This appears in
Rising/Aceto credit memos.<fnr351>

<B24>d. <EMU>The customer deducted the rebate from the payments made to Rising/Aceto</EMU>. This
appears in the Cash Application Document.<fnr352> This is also a third-party document.<fnr353>

<B24>e. Rising/Aceto also produced general ledgers to corroborate the rebate was requested,
validated, and given.<fnr354> In fact, Mr. Cowhey's demonstrative exhibit showed ledger
support for every sample.<fnr355>

<P20>The Court is satisfied that these and similar proofs Rising/Aceto submitted in support of
the rebate sampling transactions provided reasonable assurances that the sampled transactions
occurred as reported by Rising/Aceto.

<HN46><EMB>(c) Returns</EMB>

<P20>Rising/Aceto's returns were handled by third-party vendors, first Inmar and then
Qualanex.<fnr356> Rising/Aceto received information concerning returns from those vendors, <EM>i.e.,</EM>
return reports confirming customers returned products to the vendor.<fnr357> Initially, Rising/Aceto
received return reports from the vendor via EDI feed. Then, Qualanex created a portal from
which Mr. Hughes' team downloaded return reports onto Excel.<fnr358> Rising/Aceto did not pay
returns with a check; instead, Rising/Aceto issued credit memos.<fnr359>
<Page 74>

<P20>Rising/Aceto produced internal and third-party documents to demonstrate the essential
components of this process and its accuracy, including documents proving the following facts:

<B24>a. <EMU>The customer made the return claim</EMU>. This was shown by the return reports from the
vendors. In 2021, Mr. Hughes downloaded all available return reports directly from
Qualanex's portal. Nearly half of the sampling transactions were supported with return
reports downloaded directly from Qualanex.<fnr360> For prior periods, Rising/Aceto produced
the individual return reports available on its systems.<fnr361> The return reports are third-party
documents.<fnr362>

<B24>b. <EMU>Rising validated and authorized the customer to take the return credit</EMU>. This was shown by
Rising/Aceto credit memos.<fnr363>

<B24>c. <EMU>The customer deducted the return credit from payments due Rising/Aceto</EMU>. This was
shown by the Rising/Aceto general ledgers.<fnr364>

<P20>As illustrated by the Audit Demonstrative chart, this process and evidence was repeated for
other sampling transactions in this category. Based on this evidence and the testimony of Ms.
Ryan and Mr. Hughes, the Court is satisfied that Rising/Aceto also appropriately and reasonably
validated the sampling requests as to returns.

<HN68><EMB>(iv) Cowhey's Audit Standards Were Too High and Essentially Required Perfection</EMB>

<P20>In his analysis, Mr. Cowhey failed every chargeback, rebate, and return transaction he
sampled.<fnr365> In reaching these conclusions, Mr. Cowhey not only appeared to demand perfection,
which is not the standard, but also failed to credit the persuasive evidence and the testimony
provided by Ms. Ryan and Mr. Hughes that provided various forms of support for these
<Page 75>
transactions. Mr. Cowhey's position was that if Rising/Aceto did not provide every document
identified on his Audit Demonstrative, the transaction failed his audit.<fnr366> Mr. Cowhey asserted
that he did not consider the alternative support offered by Rising/Aceto because that would
modify the audit protocol.<fnr367> However, the AICPA and GAAS guidelines cited by both sides
require an audit or to perform alternative procedures.<fnr368> Mr. Cowhey did not do this.

<P20>In his trial testimony, Mr. Cowhey often did not credit even third-party evidence,
including documentation that came directly from customers in response to subpoenas.<fnr369> In fact,
none of the documents customers produced in response to subpoenas are identified in his Audit
Demonstrative.<fnr370> In this Court's view, Mr. Cowhey's refusal to consider alternative support,
including third-party evidence, detracted materially from Mr. Cowhey's opinions and
conclusions that each of these categories of transactions failed on every occasion. Accordingly,
the Court rejects his conclusions.

<P20>The Court also rejects Mr. Cowhey's claim that Rising/Aceto did not produce certain
documents he requested regarding the sampling transactions.<fnr371> For example, the testimony and
evidence at trial showed that neither he nor Sigmapharm requested the "WAC" (Wholesale
Acquisition Cost) Invoices to Rising/Aceto customers and that this information was publicly
available in any event.<fnr372> Rebate Sample 63 is telling in these regards. Mr. Cowhey failed this
transaction because Rising/Aceto did not provide the WAC invoice, even though Sigmapharm
<Page 76>
did not ask for it and Rising/Aceto provided: (i) an email from the customer attaching an invoice
for the rebates that included an itemized breakdown of the credits, including the rebates; (ii) a
Rising/Aceto credit memo authorizing the credit; and (iii) a remittance form from the customer
showing it took the credit.<fnr373> Further, Mr. Cowhey acknowledged that he reviewed external
calculation files that came directly from the customer, which are also third-party documents.<fnr374>
As Ms. Ryan explained, with that third party information (and the other evidence supporting the
transaction) there would be no need for an "internal" calculation to reasonably validate the
transaction.<fnr375>

<P20>A similar problem arose with Mr. Cowhey's complaints about missing documents such as
WAC invoices or Internal Pricing Letters relating to chargebacks, even though Sigmapharm did
not ask for them.<fnr376> In this regard, chargeback sample 10, which Mr. Cowhey failed, is
illustrative. At trial, Mr. Cowhey testified that he failed this transaction because Rising/Aceto did
not provide an Internal Pricing Letter. However, on cross-examination, Mr. Cowhey confirmed
that Rising/Aceto <EM>did</EM> provide the actual pricing letter signed by a customer &mdash; a third-party
document.<fnr377> Yet, even that was not good enough. It was, however, sufficient for Ms. Ryan along
with the other support provided.<fnr378>

<P20>Similarly, for returns, the evidence showed that Sigmapharm did not request customer
Contracts, Internal Calculation Files, WAC Invoices, or confirmed Customer Payments.<fnr379> Yet
<Page 77>
these transactions were failed because Rising/Aceto did not provide them, and even though
alternative support was available for those transactions.<fnr380>

<P20>In sum, the Court rejects Mr. Cowhey's failure of all the rebate, chargeback, and return
transactions that he audited. Based on the testimony of Ms. Ryan and Mr. Hughes, and the
supporting evidence they relied on, this Court finds that these categories of credits were amply
supported in the course of the audit and provided at least reasonable assurances that the
underlying transactions did in fact occur.<fnr381>

<HN02><EMB>C. Sigmapharm's Failure to Provide Notice and Opportunity to Cure to Rising/Aceto Does
Not Preclude Its Breach of Contract Claim and Defenses</EMB>

<HN24><EMB>1. Sigmapharm Failed to Prove That Giving Notice of the Breach Would be Futile</EMB>

<P20>As noted by this Court's Opinion and October 6, 2021 Order,<fnr382> Sigmapharm unlawfully
terminated and breached the Agreement on March 23, 2018 by failing to provide the prior notice
and an opportunity to cure required under the Agreement.<fnr383> In seeking to avoid or reduce any
recovery by Rising/Aceto, Sigmapharm argues that its failure to comply with the termination
provisions should be excused because providing notice and opportunity to cure would have been
futile.<fnr384> However, as is set forth in more detail below, Sigmapharm did not provide any persuasive
evidence (as opposed to speculation) that Rising/Aceto's breaches were "impossible" to fix<fnr385> or
<Page 78>
"incurable."<fnr386> To the contrary, as is noted elsewhere in this Opinion, the Court is persuaded that
Rising/Aceto's breaches of the Audit Provisions were curable and that some (but by no means all)
were, in fact, ultimately cured, albeit after years of delays, obstruction and litigation.

<P20>As Rising/Aceto has pointed out, the Agreement provides for an initial cure period of 90
days for termination based on material breach which may be extended for an additional 90 days.<fnr387>
A key component of notice and cure provisions is that it gives the breaching party the right to cure
a default, as well as identifying the default that needs to be cured.<fnr388> In arguing that giving notice
would have been futile, Sigmapharm is asking the Court to speculate that Rising/Aceto could <EM>never</EM>
have cured its breaches, without offering any persuasive evidence in support. Contrary to
Sigmapharm's arguments, it is entirely possible that once formally notified of a breach,
Rising/Aceto may have taken advantage of the up to six-month cure period to do so. Mr. Hughes
demonstrated Rising/Aceto's desire to cure the FY 2017 discrepancy by saying "this needs to get
resolved ASAP, this is my focus."<fnr389> Further, as is found elsewhere in this Opinion, Rising/Aceto
did ultimately provide the underlying data needed to audit Rising/Aceto's profit share accounting,
even though it required longer than Sigmapharm wanted with respect to Audit Period I and years
of litigation as to Audit Period II.<fnr390>
<Page 79>

<P20><EM>Young Travelers Day Camps, Inc. v. Felson,</EM><fnr391> the primary case Sigmapharm relies on for
its futility argument, and cases that follow it, are based on breaches that went to the essence of the
parties' agreement and rendered the requirement to give notice futile and inapplicable.<fnr392> In <EM>Young
Travelers,</EM> the initial breaching party was "as close to anticipatory repudiation of the contract as
possible," and then failed to perform, rendering a cure immaterial or impossible, <EM>i.e.,</EM> futile.<fnr393> The
other cases cited by Sigmapharm for this proposition (often franchise cases) also found that the
breach went to the essence or fundamental purpose of the parties' agreement.<fnr394> While the Audit
Provisions were certainly material terms of the Agreement, they did not go to the Agreement's
essence or purpose. That essence was the development, marketing and sale of generic
pharmaceuticals. Therefore, the <EM>Young Travelers</EM> line of cases is distinguishable on this basis.
Further, as noted above, the Court is not at all convinced that Rising/Aceto could not have cured
any breaches within the time limits of the Agreement.

<P20>Next, as Rising/Aceto argues, compliance with the Agreement's notice provision was not
optional; thus, the "futility" exception does not apply.<fnr395> Rather than being a mere "formality,"
<Page 80>
the notice provisions of the Agreement were obviously material terms, as there were "two tiers"
of notice and the breaching party was given a period of up to six months to cure a material
breach <EM>after</EM> proper notice was issued. As was argued by Rising/Aceto, and found by this Court,
the purpose of these carefully crafted provisions was to give notice of the alleged breach and a
potentially extended opportunity to cure.<fnr396> Thus, compliance was not optional.

<P20>Additionally, even though this Court has found that Rising/Aceto was in breach of the
Audit Provisions of the Agreement, Sigmapharm waived the "futility" defense and argument by
continuing to perform under the Agreement for more than a year after it issued its alleged
"Notice of Breach" on December 16, 2016. The New Jersey Supreme Court has held that
following a breach "any action indicating an intention to perform will operate as a conclusive
choice, <EM>not indeed depriving him of a right of action for the breach which has already taken
place, but depriving him of any excuse for ceasing performance on his own part.</EM>"<fnr397> Thus, by
continuing to perform, Sigmapharm waived its right to terminate the Agreement based on
Rising/Aceto's alleged breach. It did not, however, waive its right to sue for damages based on
that breach. For all these reasons, the Court rejects Sigmapharm's futility argument.

<HN24><EMB>2. Effect of Sigmapharm's Failure to Comply with the Notice and Cure Provisions of
the Agreement When Both Parties Are in Breach</EMB>

<P20>The parties' arguments regarding the effect, if any, of Sigmapharm's failure to provide the
required notice and an opportunity to cure required under the Agreement also inform the Court's
decision as to whether Sigmapharm can assert a breach of contract claim or defense against
Rising/Aceto notwithstanding that failure. Rising/Aceto argues that this failure precludes such a
<Page 81>
claim or defense. Sigmapharm disagrees. Both parties focus on cases where the issue was
whether one party's failure to comply with an agreement's notice provisions precluded that party
from terminating the contract.<fnr398> As these authorities indicate, there is a fairly wide split of
authorities and diverging views on this issue.

<P20>While these cases certainly provide some guidance on certain of the issues before it, the
Court finds that they are distinguishable because they did not generally involve scenarios where
the issue was the appropriate remedy when parties were in breach; instead, the focus was on
whether notice was required before terminating. Here, the Court has found that both parties are
in breach and that Sigmapharm waived its right to terminate based on Rising/Aceto's breach.
However, the Court did not and does not find that Sigmapharm waived its breach of contract
claim or defenses when it failed to give the required notice. Accordingly, this Court looks to the
cases cited by the parties (and others) not for the proposition that a party that elects to continue to
perform waives its right to terminate their agreement, but rather for the corollary of that
proposition; <EM>i.e.,</EM> the party that elects to continue to perform in the face of the other party's breach
loses its right to terminate, but retains its right to sue for damages or seek other appropriate
relief.<fnr399>

<P20>For example, Rising/Aceto cites to <EM>Aetrex Worldwide, Inc. v. Sourcing for You, Ltd.,</EM><fnr400>
which involved alleged breaches by both parties. The <EM>Aetrex</EM> court determined (in the context of a
preliminary injunction application) that even though both parties may have been in breach,
because both continued to perform under their agreement rather than electing to terminate, the
<Page 82>
plaintiff was not precluded from seeking damages against the defendant notwithstanding the
plaintiff's alleged breach of the agreement.<fnr401> In so holding, the <EM>Aetrex</EM> court relied on the
language of the New Jersey Supreme Court in <EM>Stamato,</EM> where the Court held that:

<B22>The fact that the defendant has been guilty of substantial breaches of essential
obligations under the contract would ordinarily give the plaintiff the right to deem
itself discharged from further performance and to sue the defendant for damages
under the contract. <EM>But this is not always the injured party's only course of action.</EM>
In a case of `a material breach of contract which does not, however, indicate
any intention to renounce or repudiate the remainder of the contract ... the injured
party has a genuine election offered him of continuing performance or of ceasing to
perform, and any action indicating an intention to perform will operate as a conclusive
choice, <EM>not indeed depriving him of a right of action for the breach which has already
taken place, but depriving him of any excuse for ceasing performance on his own part.</EM>'<fnr402>

<P00>Here, the issue is not about continuing performance but rather about whether a breaching party is
foreclosed from seeking damages for the other party's breach.

<P20>In <EM>VoterLabs, Inc. v. Ethos Grp. Consulting Servs., LLC,</EM><fnr403> a case analogous to this one,
the plaintiff argued that the defendant was foreclosed from countersuing for breach of contract
because it had failed to provide the notice and opportunity to cure required by the parties'
agreement.<fnr404> After noting that Delaware courts generally enforce pre-suit notice provisions, the
District Court still permitted the breach of contract claim to go forward because the parties'
agreement did "not address consequences for failure to comply or otherwise tie the parties' right
to sue for breach of contract to the requirement for notice and opportunity to cure."<fnr405> By
<Page 83>
contrast, when a contract does expressly limit remedies when a party fails to comply with notice
and cure provisions, then courts will enforce that term of the contract. For example, in <EM>Ophrys
LLC v. OneMain Fin. Inc.,</EM><fnr406> the Third Circuit enforced a notice of claim provision that it found
to be clear and unambiguous. The provision in <EM>Ophrys</EM> provided that "failure to provide a Notice
of Claim with respect to any claimed breach ... shall terminate and waive any rights [a party]
may have to any remedy for breach."<fnr407> No such clear and unambiguous provision was contained
in the Agreement at issue here.

<P20>Where, as here and as in <EM>VoterLabs,</EM> a contract does not expressly provide that there must
be compliance with the notice and cure provisions prior to bringing an action for breach, then
"compliance with the notice provision is not a precondition to maintaining suit."<fnr408> Nothing in
the Agreement tied either parties' rights to sue for damages or to any other remedy to compliance
with the notice and cure provisions of the Agreement. So, Sigmapharm is not precluded from
bringing its counterclaim and defenses for breach of contract despite its failure to properly notify
Rising/Aceto of the alleged breaches of the Agreement.

<HN02><EMB>D. In Light of the Parties' Mutual Breaches, Allowing Rising/Aceto's Credit Refund Claims
and Disallowing its Lost Profits Damages Provides a Balanced and Fair Remedy</EMB>

<P20>The Court has found that Rising/Aceto breached the Audit Provisions of the Agreement
and that Sigmapharm is not precluded from asserting its breach of contract claims and defenses
as the result of its own breach. The Court must now determine what the remedy is for that
breach. As a court of equity, a bankruptcy court is directed to reach a fair and equitable result,
<Page 84>
which of course must be guided by appropriate legal principles.<fnr409> Included among those
principles is the ability to fashion an appropriate remedy based on the particular facts and
circumstances of the case.<fnr410> For the reasons that follow, the Court will award Rising/Aceto
Credit Refund damages in the full amount sought ($9,096,273), less the award the Court is
granting to Sigmapharm on the COGS issue ($1,109,492), for a total award of $7,986,981, plus
post-judgment interest at the Federal Judgment Rate from March 23, 2018 (the date of
Sigmapharm's breach). The Court will not, however, award Rising/Aceto any Lost Profits.

<P20>As detailed in this Opinion, Rising/Aceto's books and records were not complete and
accurate, nor were they transparent and readily available for independent audit. As the result of
those issues, Sigmapharm understandably determined (internally) that Rising/Aceto was in
breach of its obligations under the Agreement and decided to terminate its relationship with
Rising/Aceto as a result. Unfortunately for Sigmapharm, it did so prematurely, without giving
Rising/Aceto notice of breach and an opportunity to cure. The issue for the Court is how to
address Rising/Aceto's breaches in the face of Sigmapharm's own breach.

<P20>In this case, Sigmapharm argues that as the result of its breaches, Rising/Aceto should be
denied any recovery at all as to the Lost Profits and Credit Refund damages.<fnr411> In sharp contrast,
Rising/Aceto also argues that Sigmapharm should not be allowed any recovery based on its
<Page 85>
breach of the notice provisions of the Agreement and urges the Court to award more that $26
million (with interest) in damages, including Lost Profits of $12 million to $15 million.
However, those asserted Lost Profits would be awarded to an entity that was not only in material
breach of the Agreement, but also on the path to bankruptcy, cessation of operations, and
complete liquidation approximately one year after Sigmapharm wrongfully terminated the
Agreement in March of 2018.<fnr412> In this Court's view, awarding the full relief sought by each
party would result in an unjustified windfall and unfair advantage to one breaching party and the
equivalent of a forfeiture by the other. This Court will not countenance such inequitable results.
Instead, what the Court believes is fair is to award each party a portion of the relief that they
seek.

<HN24><EMB>1. Credit Refund Damages</EMB>

<P20>Notwithstanding Rising/Aceto's notice to its customers that it was terminating their
agreements relating to Sigmapharm Products, Rising/Aceto's customers continued to claim
credits from pre-termination sales (<EM>e.g.,</EM> chargebacks, returns and rebates) and deduct them from
payments made to Rising/Aceto.<fnr413> Thus, Rising/Aceto had to effectively finance or pay
Sigmapharm's share of the credits after the wrongful termination, even though they were
Sigmapharm's responsibility.<fnr414> While disclaiming any liability, Sigmapharm knew that "there
was an accumulating debt based upon the various credits Rising/Aceto had to honor on a cash
<Page 86>
basis after termination which were not offset by ongoing sales."<fnr415> As Mr. Kremer
acknowledged, Rising/Aceto was left "holding the bag" on these credits, but nonetheless
"expected" Rising/Aceto to continue to honor them.<fnr416> Sigmapharm's financial expert, Mr.
Cowhey, also acknowledged this.<fnr417>

<P20>Rising/Aceto's Credit Refund damages (also sometimes referred to as "Credit" damages
in this Opinion) are discreet, readily ascertainable and expected costs of doing business that were
built into the profit share calculation under the Agreement. They were also fully supported by the
testimony of Mr. Hughes, Ms. Ryan and the evidence on which they relied. Rising/Aceto actually
incurred those costs or credits without Sigmapharm paying or contributing its share. At the same
time, after the wrongful termination, Sigmapharm was selling Co-Owned Products without
paying shared expenses or deductions owed to Rising/Aceto and keeping the profits for itself.
Precluding Rising/Aceto from recovering these "hard," liquidated costs would result in an
unwarranted and substantial windfall to Sigmapharm, which also materially breached the
Agreement. Thus, for these reasons and those that follow, Rising/Aceto is entitled to recover the
Credit Refund costs.

<P20>Rising/Aceto argues, and this Court agrees, that Sigmapharm was obligated to pay its
share of the expenses under section 8.3 of the Agreement, notwithstanding its improper
termination. According to the January 2022 audit package/profit share accounting provided to
Sigmapharm by Rising/Aceto, the portion of these credits paid by Rising/Aceto that should have
been paid by Sigmapharm was $9,096,273.<fnr418>
<Page 87>

<P20>Sigmapharm's arguments in response to this claim are essentially tri-fold. First, that the
audit packages/profit share accounting provided by Rising/Aceto are inadmissible hearsay as
"litigation fueled" documents that this Court may not rely upon. Next, that even if the Court
finds them admissible, they should not be credited for various reasons, including Mr. Cowhey's
opinion testimony as to the deficiencies in Rising/Aceto's profit share accounting. Next,
Sigmapharm appears to argue, though not as forcefully or clearly, that Rising/Aceto is not
entitled to recover any actual damages because of Rising/Aceto's breach of the Audit Provisions
of the Agreement. The Court rejects each of these arguments.

<P20>The Court already addressed the first two arguments and found that the "audit packages"
provided by Rising/Aceto were admissible business records and summaries. Further, the Court
found that the Credit Refund amounts as set forth by Rising/Aceto were accurate and fully
supported by the testimony of Ms. Ryan and Mr. Hughes and the evidence they relied on. In
contrast, the Court found Mr. Cowhey's testimony on the reasonableness of those calculations
and numbers based on his audit to be unpersuasive. The Court also previously addressed
Sigmapharm's third argument and finds that Rising/Aceto's breach of the Audit Provisions of the
Agreement does not prevent it from recovering the Credit Refund damages.

<P20>Finally, this Court finds it would be unfair for Sigmapharm to obtain an unwarranted
windfall in the form of not paying for its share of millions of dollars of credits that Rising/Aceto
paid to its customers in the form of Credit Refunds, and also retain all the profits from the Co-Owned
Products sold after the wrongful termination of the Agreement.
<Page 88>

<HN24><EMB>2. Lost Profits Damages</EMB>

<P20>Rising/Aceto seeks Lost Profits that it was projected to have earned over a 6-12 year
period.<fnr419> However, at the time the Agreement was wrongfully terminated in March 2018,
Rising/Aceto was in the throes of the disastrous Citron/Lucid transaction.<fnr420> Less than a year
later, Rising/Aceto filed for bankruptcy protection, ceased all ongoing operations, and liquidated
all its assets. Accordingly, the Court believes that awarding Rising/Aceto Lost Profits over an
extended 6-12 year period would result in an unfair and unwarranted windfall to Rising/Aceto,
particularly when Rising/Aceto was also in breach of the Agreement. In making this
determination, the Court simply cannot ignore and will consider the significant events that were
occurring at and around the same time the Agreement was wrongfully terminated by
Sigmapharm and in the 12-13 months thereafter. Nor can this Court ignore Mr. Hughes' candid
testimony that the profit share accountings provided to Sigmapharm were calculated (mostly, if
not exclusively) on an accrual basis, rather than on a cash basis as required. These material
breaches go directly to Audit Provisions of the Agreement and the profit share accountings it
required.

<P20>In this regard, the Court agrees with Rising/Aceto's citations to case law to the effect that
expectation damages are generally measured as of the date of the breach<fnr421> and that the rights of
the parties to a "deemed" rejected contract are generally preserved; <EM>i.e.,</EM> the Debtor retains its
<Page 89>
claims and defenses, as does the counterparty to the rejected contract.<fnr422> However, those
principles are not as absolute or clear as Rising/Aceto argues.

<P20>For example, Rising/Aceto relies on the Delaware Supreme Court case of <EM>SIGA Techs.,
Inc. v. PharmAthene, Inc.</EM><fnr423> for the general proposition that damages are incurred as of the date
of breach or "<EM>ex ante.</EM>" According to <EM>Black's Law Dictionary,</EM> "<EM>ex ante</EM>" means "based on
assumption and prediction, on how things appeared beforehand, rather than in hindsight."<fnr424>
However, the Delaware Supreme Court in <EM>SIGA</EM> approved of the Chancery Court using post-breach
evidence on remand "to aid in its determination of the proper expectations as of the date
of the breach."<fnr425> Other cases cited by Rising/Aceto reach the same conclusion and find that
limited use of post-breach events is proper in determining the reasonable expectations regarding
future profits at the time of the breach.<fnr426> Thus, pre- and post-breach events may be considered in
defining the parties' expectations at the time of breach.

<P20>Relatedly, the rejection of an agreement in bankruptcy undeniably impacts the underlying
rights and obligations of the partes (<EM>e.g.,</EM> debtor rejecting a lease cannot assert a continued right
to possession), but "it does not rescind the lease or defeat any pending claims or defenses that the
debtor had in regard to that lease."<fnr427>
<Page 90>

<P20>In this case, the events surrounding and soon after Sigmapharm's March 2018 breach are
significant and certainly would impact Rising/Aceto's profit expectations as of the time of the
breach. These events include the approximately $250 million write-off driven by the failed
Citron/Lucid transaction, the negative guidance being provided to the public and the retention of
bankruptcy/restructuring professionals. All of these events occurred at or around the time period
Sigmapharm terminated the Agreement, and all served to dim if not shatter Rising/Aceto's future
expectations of not only profits, but even of remaining in business. In fact, Rising/Aceto filed for
bankruptcy protection in February 2019, less than a year after the termination, and sold the
Pharma Business in April 2019 for a fraction of what it paid. The Court will not and cannot
ignore these realities<fnr428> in assessing Rising/Aceto's Lost Profits claims and finds that
Rising/Aceto's expectations at the time Sigmapharm breached were bleak and worsening, with
its long-term prospects limited at best.

<P20>For all these reasons, the Court finds that awarding Rising/Aceto Lost Profits that would
have been earned over a 6-12-year period (depending on the Product and its estimated remaining
life),<fnr429> would be contrary to Rising/Aceto's reasonable and realistic expectations at the time of
Sigmapharm's breach and would result in an unwarranted windfall to Rising/Aceto. Precluding
Rising/Aceto from recovering these projected profits is also, in this Court's view, an appropriate
(and proportionate) remedy for Rising/Aceto's breach of the Audit Provisions of the Agreement,
particularly when considered in connection with the Court's award of the Credit Refund damages
<Page 91>
to Rising/Aceto, even though it was also in breach. The same is true in the opposite direction as
the award of Credit Refund damages to Rising/Aceto prevents Sigmapharm from obtaining a
windfall (in the form of the hard and measurable costs Rising/Aceto incurred and Sigmapharm
did not pay), even though Sigmapharm was also in breach.

<HN24><EMB>3. Rising/Aceto's Lost Profits Claims Would be Limited to One Year in any Event</EMB>

<P20>The Court also notes for the record that it was generally satisfied with the manner in
which Ms. Ryan calculated Lost Profits, notwithstanding Sigmapharm's challenges to her
credibility (the Court finds her to be credible) and forecasting methodology. Those calculations
were fully supported by detailed testimony describing the methodology she used and the
conservative sales assumptions that were made based on past sales history. Further, those
assumptions were at least roughly borne out by Sigmapharm's actual sales <EM>after</EM> its wrongful
termination of the Agreement. With the assistance of Mr. Hughes and other A&M employees,
Ms. Ryan was able to gather the necessary supporting data, make adjustments and corrections
where appropriate, and make reasonable and adequately supported projections on Rising/Aceto's
profit share.<fnr430> However, even accepting Ms. Ryan's projections, if this Court were to award lost
profit damages (and it is not) this Court would limit Rising/Aceto's Lost Profits damages to one
year after the March 2018 termination, for the following reasons, as well as those described
above.

<P20>First, as this Court previously found, the Agreement was executory at the time
Rising/Aceto filed for bankruptcy protection and deemed rejected under Rising/Aceto's Plan.<fnr431>
<Page 92>
As a result, Rising/Aceto's breach was deemed to have occurred on February 18, 2019, the day
before its bankruptcy filing.<fnr432> That date is 11 months, just shy of a year, after the wrongful
termination. Second, Rising/Aceto essentially stopped operating shortly after its bankruptcy
filing in February 2019 and focused its efforts on liquidating all its assets. As noted, the Pharma
Business was sold at a steep discount shortly thereafter, in April of 2019, which is thirteen
months after the March 2018 termination. In other words, Rising/Aceto was in bankruptcy, no
longer operating, and liquidating within 11-13 months of the Agreement's termination. This was
no surprise, but rather a consequence that could have been reasonably expected by Rising/Aceto
in March of 2018.

<P20>Thus, even if this Court would have determined that the award of Lost Profits to
Rising/Aceto was appropriate (and it did not), the Court would have limited that claim to one
year (at the low end of the range calculated by Ms. Ryan).

<HN02><EMB>E. Rising/Aceto is Not Entitled to Recover for the Alleged Reduction in the Shore Suven
APA Purchase Price</EMB>

<P20>Rising/Aceto's damages claims include $913,761 for the alleged reduction in the
purchase price Shore Suven paid for the acquisition of Rising/Aceto's generic pharmaceuticals
assets (the "Pharma Assets").<fnr433> According to Rising/Aceto, this amount represents
Sigmapharm's 55% share of the $1,490,939 total "dollar for dollar" reduction in the purchase
price attributable to the return of Rising/Sigmapharm Co-Owned Products.<fnr434> The Court rejects
this aspect of Rising/Aceto's damages claim for several reasons.
<Page 93>

<P20>First, Rising/Aceto asserts that in its original letter of intent dated January 15, 2019,
Shore Suven offered a gross purchase price for Rising/Aceto's pharmaceutical business of $89.28
million, without the assumption of any liabilities.<fnr435> Here, the Court notes that pursuant to the
Citron/Lucid Acquisition in December 2016, Rising/Aceto acquired certain product lines from
Citron and Lucid for $260 million in cash, plus a deferred payment to the seller of $50 million in
December 2021 and the issuance of 5.122 million shares of Aceto common stock beginning in
December 2019.<fnr436> These assets were a substantial portion of the assets that were the subject of
the January 15, 2019 letter of intent and that were sold back to Shore Suven for $15 million in
cash along with the assumption of certain unspecified and unliquidated liabilities in April
2019.<fnr437>

<P20>As the greatly diminished sale price for the Pharma Assets shows, the Citron/Lucid
Acquisition quickly proved disastrous for Rising/Aceto. This significant disparity in price in
such a short period (about two years) by itself demonstrates that there were multiple factors that
may have contributed to the reduced purchase price besides any Rising/Aceto liabilities Shore
Suven may have assumed.

<P20>As was stated by Rising/Aceto in an April 2018 press release, soon after this acquisition,
it began experiencing "persistent adverse conditions in the generics market" and was forced to
negotiate financial covenant waivers from its lenders.<fnr438> That same press release advised the
public that Rising/Aceto's financial guidance issued on February 1, 2018 should no longer be
relied upon and that Rising/Aceto anticipated taking substantial "impairment charges, including
<Page 94>
goodwill, in the range of <EM>$230 million to $260 million</EM>" relating to the generic products business,
a substantial portion of which came about as the result of the Citron/Lucid Acquisition.<fnr439>
Additionally, Rising/Aceto received notice from the U.S. government that 11 generic products
Rising/Aceto acquired in the Citron/Lucid Acquisition were not in compliance with certain
important Federal Trade Agreement Act country-of-origin provisions in the government supply
contracts acquired from Lucid.<fnr440> Finally, in a press release issued in May 2018, Rising/Aceto
advised that it was taking a "goodwill and intangibles" charge "in the third quarter of fiscal 2018
(ended March 31, 2018) of $256.3 million, all of which related to Rising."<fnr441>

<P20>Returning to Rising/Aceto's damages claim, Rising/Aceto relies on Ms. Roof's trial
testimony where she stated "the purchase price would be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis for
such liabilities," including customer returns, etc., and that after extensive negotiations Shore
Suven agreed to assume all gross-to-net liabilities (e.<EM>g.,</EM> chargebacks and returns) that Rising
owed to customers.<fnr442> But the purchase price that Shore Suven and Rising/Aceto ultimately
agreed to on March 7, 2019, less than two months after the $89.28 million letter of intent, was
just $15 million in cash with the assumption of certain of Rising/Aceto's accrued liabilities to
customers, including gross to net reductions.<fnr443> Here, it bears noting that these assets (and others)
were sold back to an entity owned or controlled by the principal of Citron/Lucid, at a greatly
reduced price, after a substantial portion of those assets had been sold to Rising/Aceto only two
years before for $270 million or so.<fnr444> That same principal was a member of Rising/Aceto's
<Page 95>
Board of Directors until November 14, 2018, which was apparently when he began negotiating
for the repurchase &mdash; at a substantial discount &mdash; of many of the same assets he sold to
Rising/Aceto for about $270 million just two years before.<fnr445>

<P20>Even Rising/Aceto had trouble defining the purchase price of the Pharma Assets.
Rising/Aceto's motion to approve the sale of those assets indicated that the purchase price was
$27 million, excluding Assumed Liabilities, plus Cure Costs that <EM>could</EM> total $125 million.<fnr446> In
contrast, Rising/Aceto's Proposed Findings of Fact indicate that "Rising received only $15
million in cash for its assets," with "the most significant part of the consideration being Shore
Suven's agreement to assume Rising's liabilities to its customers."<fnr447> This Court initially
understood this statement to refer to Cure Costs, not some undisclosed and undefined liabilities
not associated with Cure Costs, as Rising/Aceto now asserts.

<P20>As both parties repeatedly note, Cure Costs are not the same as the cost of assuming
Rising/Aceto's liabilities to its customers. Further, Rising/Aceto's Agreement with Sigmapharm
was <EM>not</EM> assumed by Shore Suven; therefore, there could be no "Cure Costs" associated with the
acquisition relating to Sigmapharm.<fnr448> Thus, it appears that the assumption of Rising/Aceto's
liabilities to customers was a separate part of the transaction that was not fully disclosed to
Sigmapharm or the Court when it was approved. Based on that lack of disclosure and the frankly
inconsistent or conflicting information as to the nature and amount of liabilities being assumed
by Shore Suven, there is no way for this Court or Sigmapharm to determine how much, if any, of
the purchase price was directly attributable "on a dollar for dollar basis" (or otherwise) to Shore
<Page 96>
Suven's assumption of certain liabilities relating to Rising/Aceto's customers, including any
individual customer such as Sigmapharm.

<P20>Additionally, the math here simply does not work. The difference between the $89.28
million letter of intent purchase price, without assuming any liabilities, and the $15 (or $27)
million in cash Shore Suven paid cannot be reconciled for various reasons, even with the
assumption of certain undefined and unliquidated liabilities. First, Sigmapharm was not
Rising/Aceto's only partner in the pharmaceutical business, and there was no indication or
evidence submitted at trial as to how much of these other liabilities Shore Suven assumed
relating to other customers (if any) or how those liabilities were treated.

<P20>Similarly, any liabilities relating to Sigmapharm Co-Owned Products were not part of the
Cure Costs, as noted above. So, there is no way to reconcile the $27 million plus up to $125
million in Cure Costs referenced in the Sale Motion with the $15 million plus unidentified and
unliquidated amounts attributable to Shore Suven's agreement to assume Rising/Aceto's liability
to certain of its customers, as referenced in Rising/Aceto's Proposed Findings of Fact.

<P20>Significantly, there were no documents that evidenced or described this dollar-for-dollar
reduction. Thus, based on the evidence submitted at trial (or the lack thereof), there is no way for
this Court to determine how much of any asserted reduction in the purchase price was attributed
to any specific liabilities assumed by Shore Suven on a dollar-for-dollar basis (or otherwise). The
fact that Ms. Roof may have attempted to "isolate" the accrued liabilities attributable to the Co-Owned
Products is not sufficient evidence to connect those specific amounts to any specific
reduction or adjustment of the purchase price. Instead, that reduction and the final purchase price
were obviously subject to various and numerous other factors that make these types of precise
calculations or attributions difficult, if not impossible. Finally, there was no testimony from
<Page 97>
anyone at Shore Suven (or Rising/Aceto) that corroborated Ms. Roof's testimony or conclusions
in this regard (with any testimony as to what Shore Suven may have said about the dollar-for-dollar
reduction being inadmissible and unreliable hearsay in any event). The Court finds that
omission significant.

<P20>Further, as Sigmapharm points out, the APA between Rising/Aceto and Shore Suven
makes clear that any asset or liability not specifically assumed is excluded. This Court's Order
approving the Pharma Assets Sale confirms that exclusion.<fnr449> No schedule attached to the filed
and approved APA listed any Sigmapharm liabilities assumed by Shore Suven. The schedule
Rising/Aceto refers to in support of its arguments to the contrary (Schedule 1.3(c)) was not
attached to the APA approved by the Court or made available to the other parties-in-interest, such
as Sigmapharm.<fnr450> Neither was Schedule 1.1(b), which Rising/Aceto also refers to, attached to
the APA when it was submitted to and approved by this Court.<fnr451> Nor was there any testimony as
to how and to what extent the purchase price was impacted by the specific Pharma Assets being
acquired or any other liabilities being assumed by Shore Suven (besides those allegedly relating
to Sigmapharm). Thus, neither Sigmapharm nor this Court had any notice of this purported
separate assumption of liabilities, as this Court found at trial.<fnr452>

<P20>In sum, the amount and components of consideration that made up the reduced purchase
price for the Pharma Assets changed dramatically over a few short months and that purchase
price was necessarily based on a number of interrelated factors, such as the drastic decline in
<Page 98>
Rising/Aceto's Pharma business, the disastrous Citron/Lucid Acquisition, its regulatory issues
with certain contracts acquired from Citron/Lucid, and Rising/Aceto's general financial
condition, all of which led to its bankruptcy filing. The Court simply is not convinced that there
was such a direct correlation between the Pharma Assets purchase price and Shore Suven's
assumption of Rising/Aceto's liabilities related to Sigmapharm. Accordingly, this Court will not
award damages to Rising/Aceto based on the alleged reduction of the Shore Suven purchase
price as the result of Shore Suven's asserted assumption of certain undisclosed and unidentified
liabilities of Rising/Aceto to Sigmpharm customers.

<HN02><EMB>F. The COGS Dispute</EMB>

<P20>As previously noted, at the November 20, 2015 meeting between Sigmapharm and
Rising/Aceto executives, Sigmapharm indicated its belief that Rising/Aceto had improperly
changed its COGS calculations and that, as a result, Rising/Aceto owed Sigmapharm
approximately $1.1 million.<fnr453> At the time, it was also Sigmapharm's position that Rising/Aceto
was improperly calculating COGS on an accrual instead of cash basis.<fnr454> Sigmapharm therefore
wanted its audit to include an inquiry into the COGS calculation, as well as verification of
Rising/Aceto's profit share calculations.<fnr455>

<P20>Subsequently, in October 2016, a new Rising/Aceto employee, Lisa Matthews, began
calculating COGS based on the product's Transfer Price, without considering Rising/Aceto's
portion of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API"), which was inconsistent with the method
of calculating COGS that Mr. Kremer and Mr. Licata had agreed upon more than a year
<Page 99>
earlier.<fnr456> As a result, Sigmapharm's December 16 Letter included an invoice for $1,109,491.81
based on Rising/Aceto's assertedly improper calculation of COGS.<fnr457> There, Mr. Kremer stated
that "COGS should be the Transfer Price of product sold by Sigmapharm to Rising/Aceto, less
Rising/Aceto's share of API cost where Rising has contributed to the purchase of a product's
API," which was "consistent with Rising/Aceto's own calculation of COGS from April 2015 to
current."<fnr458>

<P20>At or around this time, Mr. Licata, who had been Rising's CFO, left Rising. In July 2017,
Mr. Licata was replaced by Mr. Hughes. On August 2, 2017, Mr. Hughes asked Mr. Kremer to
provide his support for his COGS calculation and invoice.<fnr459> Mr. Kremer responded on August
14, 2017 by citing to various provisions of the Agreement, repeating that his calculation method
was the same as Mr. Licata's and was the way which COGS was being calculated by
Rising/Aceto at that time.<fnr460> Both sides acknowledged that this issue was left open and
unresolved at the time the Agreement was terminated, but was then being calculated as Mr.
Kremer believed appropriate. However, Rising/Aceto subsequently changed the calculation to
exclude Rising/Aceto's share of the API that was included it in its final profit share report in
2022.<fnr461> Mr. Hughes acknowledged that he made this change after being told to do so by
counsel.<fnr462>
<Page 100>

<P20>By email dated September 15, 2017, Rising/Aceto explained the basis of its disagreement
with Sigmapharm's COGS calculation. Rising/Aceto stated that: (i) the gross invoice amount
should include the entire API cost (not 50%) and (ii) since Rising paid for 50% of the API, the
credit is on the invoice as reimbursement for the advance payment of API.<fnr463> In the September
17, 2017 email, Rising/Aceto also requested that Sigmapharm send to them the Schedules to the
Agreement that Mr. Kremer had referred in his August 14, 2017 email.<fnr464> Thus, by definition,
Rising/Aceto had not reviewed the information contained in those schedules prior to reversing its
COGS calculations.

<P20>Sigmapharm argues that its calculation of COGS is not only consistent with the language
of the Agreement, but also the manner in which Rising/Aceto calculated COGS for the two years
prior to Mr. Hughes' arrival, and how it was being calculated at the time the Agreement was
terminated. In further support of its position, Sigmapharm cites to the "plain language" of the
Agreement which states that "COGS is the price contingently charged by Sigmapharm" for the
purchase of Products, "which amount shall not exceed Sigmapharm's Transfer Price."<fnr465> Thus,
the price "contingently charged" by Sigmapharm could be the Transfer Price but could not
exceed it. Transfer Price is separately defined by the Agreement as "Sigmapharm's fully
absorbed manufacturing cost" which includes "the direct Unit Cost of Raw Materials."<fnr466> Raw
Materials includes the "active pharmaceutical ingredients" for the Products. Sigmapharm argues
that since Transfer Price is a defined term, the Agreement would have said the COGS includes
the Transfer Price rather than the price contingently charged by Sigmapharm if that was what
<Page 101>
was intended.<fnr467> Instead, it refers to a contingent charge to take into account things like the 50%
advance by Rising/Aceto for the active pharmaceutical ingredients. Sigmapharm also relies on
Mr. Licata's asserted agreement with the method of COGS calculation advanced by Sigmapharm.

<P20>In response, Rising/Aceto argues that its COGS calculation is appropriate as a matter of
common sense, is consistent with the plain language of the Agreement and that it should include
all raw material costs, without giving effect to the Rising/Aceto advance. According to
Rising/Aceto, this calculation results in an additional $616,779 owed to Rising/Aceto rather than
the $1,109,491.81 Sigmapharm says it is owed from Rising/Aceto for the period prior to March
31, 2016.<fnr468>

<P20>The Court agrees with Sigmapharm's calculation and interpretation of the Agreement. In
this Court's view, the Agreement's language regarding the amount "contingently charged by
Sigmapharm" contemplates that there may be changes from the Transfer Price to the actual
amount ultimately charged by Sigmapharm.<fnr469> That amount did change when Rising/Aceto paid
or advanced to Sigmapharm 55% of the cost to acquire API and later received a credit for that
advance against the Transfer Price upon delivery of the finished Products, as is acknowledged by
Rising/Aceto.<fnr470> And that amount is not the Transfer Price. It is hornbook law that a contract is to
be interpreted so as to give effect to all its provisions.<fnr471> If Rising/Aceto's interpretation is
<Page 102>
adopted, the "contingently charged" language would have no meaning. Also, if the entire
Transfer Price was to be deducted, this defined term would (or should) have been used in the
COGS definition. Finally, including the entire API cost as initially charged by Sigmapharm
without acknowledging the credit Rising/Aceto received for the payment results in double-counting
of expenses and a reduction of the amount due Sigmapharm.

<P20>Accordingly, the Court will award Sigmapharm $1,109,491.81 in damages for the
improper calculation of COGS during the periods prior to March 31, 2016 based on its
calculation of COGS. This amount will be offset against Rising/Aceto's Credit Refund damages.

<CN><EMB>VII. CONCLUSION</EMB>

<P20>The Court finds that both sides materially breached the Agreement. Sigmapharm
breached the Agreement by improperly terminating it without providing notice and an
opportunity to cure. Rising/Aceto breached the Audit Provisions by failing to timely provide
Sigmapharm with "complete and accurate records" that were "transparent and readily available
for independent audit purposes." Based on these mutual breaches and the proofs at trial, the
Court awards judgment in favor of Rising/Aceto against Sigmapharm in the amount of
$7,986,781 for net Credit Refund damages after offsetting the award to Sigmapharm on the
COGS claim ($9,096,273-$1,109,492), plus interest at the Federal Judgment Rate from March
23, 2018 (the date of Sigmapharm's breach) until fully paid. The Court will enter a Judgment in
accordance with this Opinion.

of an "independent audit" are (1) "identifying all of the level of detail that you need,
accumulating that detail;" (2) "making sure that you have one hundred percent of the detail;" (3)
"taking that detail and identifying sample selections that you want to support for," which he
described as "best.... is third party support;" and (4) "going on site[, looking] at hard copy
documents..." Day 17, Kremer, 24:2-20; CC-364.

Mr. Kremer acknowledged that he did not know how to "pivot" to certain
information that Rising/Aceto provided in electronic spreadsheet format and incorrectly thought
that the information had not been provided. Day 22, Kremer, 118:3-11, 119:15-19, 130:11-20.
(Mr. Kremer testifying that he had not heard of and did not know how to use pivot tables in an
Excel spreadsheet). Thus, Rising/Aceto provided the information requested, but Sigmapharm
simply did not know how to access it.

Rising/Aceto's accountings sometimes showed that Sigmapharm was owed more on a cash basis
than on an accrual basis, when that situation would typically and logically be in reverse, as
expenses are deducted before they are actually paid when accounted for on an accrual basis. <EM>See</EM>

tellingly does not cite any record evidence for that proposition. As is discussed later,
Sigmapharm argues that the audit packages are not admissible or reliable. Thus, it plainly does
not agree that the audit packages satisfied Rising/Aceto's obligations under the Agreement.

breach of the Agreement. As to Audit Period II, the Court finds that Rising/Aceto's failure to
provide Sigmapharm with the independent audit it was requesting was a material breach, as it
required several years of requests and litigation to obtain that audit.
