<P20>[&para;1] George E. Gooley appeals, and Danielle
L. Fradette cross-appeals, from the
District Court's (Portland, <EM>French, C.J.</EM>)
judgments on the parties' post-divorce and
post-trial motions. Because we conclude
that appellate review cannot meaningfully
be undertaken without specific findings on
the provisions regarding parent-child contact,
we vacate those portions of the judgment
and remand for further findings.
Similarly, we vacate and remand for further
findings on the computation of Gooley's
income, the determination of Gooley's
imputed income, and the award of Fradette's
attorney fees. We affirm the judgments
in all other respects.

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<HN00><EMB>A. Procedural History</EMB>

<P20>[&para;2] On August 19, 2016, the court
(<EM>Cashman, J.</EM>) entered a judgment granting
Gooley and Fradette a divorce and
determining parental rights and responsibilities
as to their two minor children. That
judgment was modified on November 14,
2016, changing the schedule of parent-child
contact to three days with one parent and
four days with the other parent, on a
weekly rotating basis so as to provide the
parents with equal time with the children.
On August 18, 2017, the court (<EM>J. French,
J.</EM>) entered a judgment that again modified
the divorce judgment, by, inter alia, allocating
to Fradette the right of decision-making
for the children's education; allocating
to Gooley the rights to be informed
of the children's significant educational issues
in advance and to comment on them,
and to have access to the children's educators;
maintaining the rotating, split-week
schedule of parent-child contact; and
awarding Fradette attorney fees.

<P20>[&para;3] On July 16, 2020, Gooley filed a
motion for contempt, alleging that Fradette
was willfully failing or refusing to
obey the schedule of parent-child contact
that was set by the November 2016 and
August 2017 judgments. On August 3,
2020, Fradette filed a motion for post-judgment
relief, requesting that the court
modify the parental rights and responsibilities
of the parties and award Fradette
attorney fees associated with her motion.
On March 9, 2021, Fradette moved to
amend her motion for post-judgment relief
to add her post-filing decision to move
from Maine to Massachusetts as a basis
for modification. The court (<EM>French, C.J.</EM>)
approved the amendment of the motion for
post-judgment relief in an order dated October
5, 2021.

<P20>[&para;4] On October 5, 2021, the court also
issued a scheduling order in this matter,<fnr1>
and thereafter held a four-day hearing on
<Page 4>
the parties' post-judgment motions on November
29 and 30, and December 1 and 2,
2021.<fnr2> On April 23, 2022, the court entered
its findings of facts, conclusions of law, and
judgment on the parties' post-judgment
motions. The court denied Gooley's motion
for contempt after finding that he had
failed to establish by clear and convincing
evidence that Fradette had not complied
with the contact schedule under the existing
court order. The court found that Fradette
met her burden of demonstrating
that there had been a substantial change
in circumstances due to, inter alia, Fradette's
plan to relocate to Massachusetts,
and granted, in part, her motion for post-judgment
relief. The court also awarded
Fradette primary residency of the children
and the right of final decision-making for
the children's education, and awarded the
parties shared parental rights and responsibilities
in all other respects. The court
awarded Gooley contact with both children
on the first, third, and, when applicable,
fifth weekends of each month; on Wednesday
evenings from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.;
and on Father's Day weekend. The court
also provided Gooley with additional contact
time with the younger child on the
fourth weekend of every month. The court
further ordered that if Fradette lived in
the greater Portland area, she would be
responsible for transporting the children
to Gooley at the beginning of his contact
period and Gooley would be responsible for
transporting the children back to Fradette
at the end of his contact period. However,
if Fradette relocated outside of the greater
Portland area, the court ordered that she
would be solely responsible for transporting
the children to and from Gooley for his
scheduled parent-child contact. Finally, the
court ordered Gooley to pay Fradette attorney
fees of $30,000.

<P20>[&para;5] On May 3, 2022, Fradette filed a
motion to alter or amend the divorce judgment,
pursuant to M.R. Civ. P. 59(e),
which sought clarity on, inter alia, whether
she was permitted to relocate with the
children to Massachusetts and, if she does
relocate, whether the court-ordered schedule
of parent-child contact and the transportation
obligations for that contact would
still apply. In her motion, Fradette also
requested, inter alia, that the court modify
its April 2022 judgment by eliminating the
Wednesday evening parent-child contact if
Fradette relocates to Massachusetts; requiring
that Fradette provide all transportation
necessary for Gooley's scheduled
parent-child contact only if she relocates
somewhere that is over fifty miles away
from Portland; and eliminating Gooley's
separate fourth-weekend contact and
week-on, week-off summer contact with
the younger child so that the children are
<Page 5>
always together when with Gooley. On
May 6, 2022, Gooley filed a motion for
additional findings of fact and conclusions
of law.<fnr3>

<P20>[&para;6] On June 20, 2022, the court (<EM>J.
French, J.</EM>) entered its order on the parties'
post-trial motions. The court clarified
that, regardless of whether Fradette resides
in Massachusetts or Maine, it was in
the children's best interests to primarily
reside with Fradette and to have frequent
and continuing contact with Gooley, including
on Wednesday evenings. The court also
clarified that the schedule of Wednesday
evening parent-child contact remains in effect
regardless of whether Fradette relocates
to Massachusetts.<fnr4> The court's post-trial
order denied all of the parties' other
post-trial motions and all other requests
for relief that were not expressly addressed
in the order.<fnr5>

<P20>[&para;7] Gooley appealed,<fnr6> and Fradette
cross-appealed.<fnr7> <EM>See</EM> 19-A M.R.S. &sect; 104
(2023); M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(2)(B), 2C(2). On
November 7, 2022, Fradette moved, pursuant
to M.R. App. 3(b), to permit the District
Court to enter a judgment on her
motion for an award of prospective attorney
fees in anticipation of this appeal. We
granted Fradette's motion on November 8,
2022, and denied Gooley's motion to reconsider
our order. The District Court awarded
Fradette $4,000 in prospective attorney
fees on January 3, 2023.

<HN00><EMB>B. Factual Findings</EMB>

<P20>[&para;8] The factual findings below are taken
from the District Court's judgments on the
parties' post-judgment motions and order
on the parties' post-trial motions. The
court's findings, except where indicated,
are supported by competent evidence in
the record. <EM>See Boyd v. Manter,</EM> 2018 ME
25, &para;&para; 5-6, 9, 179 A.3d 906.

<HN24><EMB>1. The Children's Best Interests</EMB>

<P20>[&para;9] The court made competent
findings to support its conclusion that
there has been a substantial change in
circumstances that is sufficient to justify a
modification of the custody arrangement,
and the following findings provide a sufficient
basis for the court's determination
that it is not in the children's best interests
to award the parties shared primary
residence of the children.<fnr8> <EM>See Kelley v.
McKee,</EM> 2019 ME 155, &para; 7, 218 A.3d 753.
<Page 6>

<P20>[&para;10] There is conflict between Gooley
and Fradette, and the older child has expressed
a meaningful preference to have
limited contact with Gooley and to not
stay overnight at Gooley's home. The parents
have very different communication
styles and have not followed their agreement
or the court's order to use a parent-communication
application. Fradette is
highly anxious regarding her interactions
with Gooley. Gooley can be overbearing
and is relentlessly demanding of Fradette
and the professionals involved with the
family. Gooley has a problem respecting
and recognizing boundaries with the children
and Fradette, and he is loud and
intense in communicating with them.

<P20>[&para;11] The children are doing well and
thriving in Maine; however, Fradette intends
to relocate to Massachusetts. The
children are appropriately and emotionally
attached to Fradette and obtain their emotional
and physical stability in her home.
Gooley lacks insight into how his behavior
has affected the children and his relationship
with them.

<HN24><EMB>2. Imputed Income and Attorney
Fees</EMB>

<P20>[&para;12] The court found that Fradette is a
registered nurse and is voluntarily unemployed.
Because no evidence of employment
available to Fradette was offered,
the court, looking to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics for the median income for registered
nurses in Maine, imputed her income
to be $69,510. Fradette has real estate
valued at $462,000, with a mortgage of
$106,395, and a retirement plan with a
value of $178,313.<fnr9> Fradette submitted an
affidavit from her attorney stating the anticipated
fees in this litigation would exceed
$56,000. The record also contains an
updated fee affidavit from Fradette's attorney
that sets forth an amount in excess
of $120,000. The court found Fradette's
attorney fees in this post-judgment litigation
were $69,084. Ultimately, the court
awarded Fradette attorney fees in the
amount of $30,000.<fnr10>

<P20>[&para;13] The court did not find Gooley's
testimony regarding his financial circumstances
to be credible, found that Gooley is
voluntarily underemployed, and imputed
an annual income of $137,000.<fnr11> The court
found that, in 2020, Gooley had an income
of $208,000, which comprised his earnings
of $68,000 from his employment and a
$137,000 payment from selling his business.
As a result of selling his business,
Gooley received a payment of $137,000 in
2021 and is scheduled to receive payments
of $80,000 annually in 2022, 2023, and 2024.
The court also found that Gooley sold real
estate during the pendency of the post-judgment
motions and received cash proceeds
of at least $80,000, owns other real
estate valued at $170,000 with a mortgage
of $59,862, has a retirement account with a
value of $403,326, and incurred $137,925 in
attorney fees in this matter.

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<HN02><EMB>A. Fradette's Relocation and Gooley's
Wednesday Evening Parent-Child
Contact</EMB>

<P20>[&para;14] In her cross-appeal, Fradette argues
that the court abused its discretion
<Page 7>
by denying her motion to alter or amend
the judgment and thereby requiring contact
between Gooley and the children on
Wednesday evenings even if Fradette relocates
to Massachusetts. Fradette argues
that such parent child contact would require
hours of driving to facilitate, limiting
Fradette's Wednesday work availability;
would interfere with the children's homework
assignments; and would interfere
with the children's ability to participate in
after-school activities.

<P20>[&para;15] We review for an abuse of
discretion a "court's grant or denial of a
motion seeking clarification and amendment
of a judgment." <EM>Theberge v. Theberge,</EM>
2010 ME 132, &para; 21, 9 A.3d 809. In
doing so, we consider "(1) whether factual
findings, if any, are supported by the record
pursuant to the clear error standard;
(2) whether the court understood the law
applicable to its exercise of discretion; and
(3) given the facts and applying the law,
whether the court weighed the applicable
facts and made choices within the bounds
of reasonableness." <EM>Violette v. Violette,</EM>
2015 ME 97, &para; 30, 120 A.3d 667 (quotation
marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;16] To start, we conclude, as noted
<EM>supra,</EM> that the court correctly applied the
best interest analysis in this case, and that
there is competent evidence in the record
to support nearly all of the court's findings.
The court also evidently understood
the law applicable to its exercise of discretion
and "evaluated the evidence with the
best interest factors in mind," <EM>cf. In re
Paige L.,</EM> 2017 ME 97, &para;&para; 35-39, 162 A.3d
217 (explaining that "the court [is] not
required to address each best interest factor
in its decision").

<P20>[&para;17] Turning to the final prong of
our review for an abuse of discretion, we
recognize that Fradette intends to relocate
to Massachusetts and acknowledge that
requiring Fradette to transport the children
from Massachusetts to Portland each
Wednesday <EM>could</EM> negatively impact the
children's best interests. For example,
pursuant to the court's judgments, if Fradette
moves outside of the greater Portland
area, Fradette must transport the
children to and from Gooley for two hours
of parent-child contact from 5:00 p.m. to
7:00 p.m. each Wednesday. Requiring that
Fradette make these midweek trips from
Massachusetts to Portland could impact
Fradette's employment opportunities; the
stability of Fradette's housing, especially if
economic constraints result from her employment
opportunities being limited by
the contact and transportation obligations;
the children's adjustment to their new
community and their schooling; the parties'
capacity to communicate and co-parent;
and the parties' capacity to encourage
and maintain Gooley's parent-child contact.
<EM>See, e.g.,</EM> 19-A M.R.S. &sect; 1653(3)(E), (H), (I),
(N); <EM>see also supra</EM> n.8. The court's factual
findings, however, are silent as to these
considerations, and we cannot determine
from the record before us whether the
court considered them. We therefore conclude
that the findings are insufficient to
reasonably support the decision to couple
Gooley's midweek, evening parent-child
contact with Fradette's obligation to provide
all of the interstate transportation
required by that contact.

<P20>[&para;18] We appreciate the daunting challenge
before the court and recognize its
efforts to provide Gooley with regular parent-child
contact while maintaining the
children's supportive primary residence
with Fradette; however, given the court's
limited factual findings, we are unable to
review the basis for its decision. We therefore
vacate the portion of the court's post-trial
order, and the court's underlying determinations,
requiring that Fradette
transport the children to Gooley for his
Wednesday parent-child contact even if
<Page 8>
she relocates to Massachusetts; and we
remand for the court to, in its discretion,
either make additional findings to support
its conclusion or modify the parent-child
contact.

<HN02><EMB>B. Imputed Income and Attorney Fees</EMB>

<P20>[&para;19] Gooley argues that the
court erred by imputing his income to be
$137,000 and by awarding Fradette
$30,000 in attorney fees. We review for
clear error a court's determination of a
party's income in a post-divorce judgment
proceeding, <EM>see Ehret v. Ehret,</EM> 2016 ME
43, &para; 14, 135 A.3d 101, and review for an
abuse of discretion a court's decision to
award attorney fees, <EM>Atkinson v. Capoldo,</EM>
2021 ME 27, &para; 10, 250 A.3d 1099.

<P20>[&para;20] We have consistently required
a clear explanation of the factual
basis for imputing income or awarding attorney
fees. <EM>See, e.g., Ehret,</EM> 2016 ME 43,
&para; 14, 135 A.3d 101; <EM>Capoldo,</EM> 2021 ME 27,
&para; 10, 250 A.3d 1099. For example, if a
"court finds that a party is voluntarily
underemployed, the court may impute income
to that party" but "its judgment
should contain findings regarding the
amount of <EM>and basis for</EM> the income imputed."
<EM>Ehret,</EM> 2016 ME 43, &para; 14, 135 A.3d 101
(emphasis added). Likewise, the court has
statutory authority to award reasonable
attorney fees, <EM>see</EM> 19-A M.R.S. &sect; 105
(2023), but it "must provide <EM>a concise but
clear explanation of its reasons</EM> for grant
or denial of the attorney fee award," <EM>Capoldo,</EM>
2021 ME 27, &para; 10, 250 A.3d 1099
(emphasis added) (quotation marks and alteration
omitted).

<P20>[&para;21] Here, there is competent evidence
in the record to support the court's
finding that Gooley is voluntarily underemployed
and the court, therefore, acted
within its discretion in imputing Gooley's
income. It is unclear, however, what factual
basis the court used to impute Gooley's
income to be $137,000. For example, the
court may have based Gooley's imputed
income on the fact that he received a
payment of $137,000 in 2021 due to the
sale of his business. Yet this basis is contradictory
to the court's finding that, due
to the sale of his business, Gooley is entitled
to further payments of only $80,000 in
2022, 2023, and 2024. Because Gooley's
motion for further findings of fact and
conclusions of law on this issue was denied,
<EM>see supra</EM> n.3 and accompanying text, we
cannot infer that the court intended to
base Gooley's imputed income on the
$137,000 payment he received in 2021. <EM>See
Capoldo,</EM> 2021 ME 27, &para; 10, 250 A.3d 1099.
We therefore vacate the portion of the
post-trial order determining Gooley's income
and the underlying findings, and remand
for the court to make sufficient findings
that inform the parties of the
amount<fnr12> of and basis for his imputed
income.

<P20>[&para;22] Given our conclusion that
Gooley's imputed income must be vacated,
and because Gooley's motion for further
findings of fact and conclusions of law on
this issue was denied, we must also vacate
the court's award of Fradette's attorney
fees. A party's income constitutes a necessary
factual basis that the court must consider
when it awards attorney fees. <EM>Cf.
Ehret,</EM> 2016 ME 43, &para;&para; 17-18, 135 A.3d 101.
Because the court did not provide the parties
with a sufficient factual basis for its
imputed income for Gooley, the factual basis
supporting the award of Fradette's attorney
fees is also insufficient. Similarly,
our conclusion applies to the court's January
3, 2023, order awarding Fradette prospective
attorney fees in anticipation of
this appeal. On remand, after determining
<Page 9>
the amount of and basis for Gooley's imputed
income, the court should consider
what attorney fees, if any, are appropriate
to award Fradette and provide a clear
explanation of its reason for its determination.<fnr13>

<P20>[&para;23] We affirm the judgments in all
other respects.<fnr14>

<P20>The entry is:

<B22>Judgment on post-divorce motions and
order on post-trial motions vacated in
part as indicated in this opinion. Judgment
and order affirmed in all other
respects. Remanded to the District
Court to make further findings of fact
and conclusions of law consistent with
this opinion and to amend the judgment
or order, or both, as it deems appropriate
based on the further findings and
conclusions.
<FN>
<fnt1> The court's detailed scheduling order provided
for a four-day hearing, with regular
scheduled breaks. The court stated that the
parties were each permitted ten and a half
hours to present their cases, including direct
and cross-examination. The court allocated
three hours for the guardian ad litem to do
the same. The court also provided detailed
directions for the parties regarding identifying
witnesses and admission of various items
of evidence, including depositions of experts.
Prior to trial, the court (<EM>Woodman, J.</EM>) denied
Gooley's motion for adequate trial time,
which asserted that the scheduled four days of
trial was inadequate for Gooley to present
evidence and witnesses.

<fnt2> At the beginning of the fourth day of trial,
Gooley again moved for additional trial time.
Gooley represented that he needed additional
time to call the following witnesses: Gooley's
father, two of Gooley's therapists, an expert
regarding a therapeutic family intervention
program for alienated children, and Gooley
himself. Prior to Gooley's motion, Gooley had
allocated a significant portion of his trial time
to the direct and re-direct examination of his
expert witness on parental alienation. The
court (<EM>French, C.J.</EM>) denied Gooley's motion,
reasoning that it had given the parties fair
notice about the time limitations, which it had
instituted after considering the nature of the
matters before the court. The court also noted
that it had encouraged the parties to discuss
the possibility of written stipulations and that
the parties, with no criticism from the court
regarding their choices, decided to go forward
with their own strategies. Finally, the
court stated that a substantial amount of the
parties' allocated time had been spent by the
parties' attorneys arguing with one another
and that the court had "done its best to move
things along." Despite its denial of Gooley's
motion, the court provided each party with an
additional fifteen minutes and, separately, additional
time to examine the guardian ad litem.
The court later denied Gooley's January
18, 2022, motion to reopen evidence.

<fnt3> Gooley's motion requested that the court
make 220 additional findings of fact and conclusions
of law, which included additional
findings regarding Gooley's income.

<fnt4> The court noted that Gooley's summer contact
schedule with the younger child superseded
the weekend and Wednesday evening
contact schedule that is in effect during the
school year.

<fnt5> The court's order on the parties' post-trial
motions thus, in effect, denied Fradette's motion
to alter or modify the divorce judgment
and Gooley's motion for additional findings of
fact and conclusions of law.

<fnt6> After filing his notice of appeal, Gooley personally,
and not through counsel, filed multiple
motions, which we strike as improper
briefing. <EM>See</EM> M.R. App. P. 7A(a)-(d).

<fnt7> Gooley's appeal was timely as he filed his
motion for post-judgment relief within the
time permitted by the standing order pertaining
to the Family Division Rules. <EM>See</EM> Standing
Order Regarding Motions for Findings of Fact
and Conclusions of Law in Family Matters
(clarifying M.R. Civ. P. 120 effective Mar. 10,
2023) https://www.courts.maine.gov/rules/text/mr_civ_p_120_standing_order_2023-03-09.pdf.
Fradette's cross-appeal was also timely
filed.

<fnt8> In its finding of additional facts, the court
stated that it had fully considered each best
interest factor and that the most important
factors to this matter were 19-A M.R.S.
&sect; 1653(3)(A)-(E), (G)-(I), (L) (2023).

<fnt9> Fradette's updated child support affidavit
indicates that the value of her retirement plan
is $183,000. Fradette did introduce in evidence
her social security earnings; however,
it is not apparent from where in the record
the court obtained its assigned value of
$178,313.

<fnt10> The court did not explain its reasoning or
which evidence it relied on to determine the
award of attorney fees to Fradette.

<fnt11> The court did not explain its reasoning or
which evidence it relied upon to impute Gooley's
income to be $137,000.

<fnt12> The court may, in its discretion, adjust
Gooley's imputed income on remand.

<fnt13> We wish to make clear that the court need
not resolve <EM>all</EM> disputes regarding its factual
findings or conclusions of law in this case; it
correctly denied <EM>most</EM> of Gooley's 220 requests
for factual findings. <EM>See supra</EM> n.3, <EM>infra</EM>
n.14; <EM>but see infra</EM> &para;&para; 19-22. The court therefore
need make only the additional findings
called for in this opinion. <EM>Cf. Cyr v. Cyr,</EM> 432
A.2d 793, 797 n.2 (Me. 1981).

<fnt14> The remainder of Gooley's arguments are
unpersuasive. We conclude that Gooley had
an opportunity to be heard that was adequate
to safeguard his parental rights. <EM>Compare supra</EM>
nn.1-2, <EM>with Geary v. Stanley,</EM> 2007 ME
133, &para; 12, 931 A.2d 1064, <EM>and Bank of Am.,
N.A. v. Camire,</EM> 2017 ME 20, &para;&para; 7-8, 155 A.3d
416; <EM>cf. In re Child of Brooke B.,</EM> 2020 ME 20,
&para;&para; 2, 4, 224 A.3d 1236 (holding that the court
did not violate a party's due process rights by
imposing a time limitation on the parties after
it made clear "to all parties throughout the
hearing that the time available was limited,
... interjected at several points to remind all
parties of the need to focus their presentations,"
and equally split the two-day hearing
between the parties). Further, the remaining
factual findings that Gooley challenges are all
supported by competent evidence in the record.
<EM>See Boyd v. Manter,</EM> 2018 ME 25, &para; 5, 179
A.3d 906; <EM>Ehret v. Ehret,</EM> 2016 ME 43, &para; 9, 135
A.3d 101. With respect to the court's other
findings and conclusions regarding children's
best interests, the court "articulated the specific
best interest factors that were important
to this case ... and made findings as to each
that are supported by substantial record evidence."
<EM>Riemann v. Toland,</EM> 2022 ME 13,
&para; 18, 269 A.3d 229. Finally, we conclude that

<P20>[&para;1] John M. Carter and Christine C.
Carter (the Carters) appeal from a judgment
entered by the Business and Consumer
Docket (<EM>Murphy, J.</EM>) after a bench
trial on a variety of claims and counterclaims
concerning the use and ownership
of certain property in the Holiday Beach
neighborhood in Owls Head. Michael A.
Voncannon and N. Kermit Voncannon (the
Voncannons) and Zachary Rogers and Kathryn
Rogers as Trustees of the Nancy C.
Rogers Irrevocable Trust (the Rogerses)
cross-appeal from the same judgment regarding
the court's determination that the
Carters have superior title to Austin Avenue,
a "paper street" appearing on plans
depicting the Holiday Beach neighborhood.
We affirm the judgment.

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<P20>[&para;2] This case involves a dispute over
the ownership and boundaries of two proposed,
unaccepted ways&mdash;known as "paper
streets"<fnr1>&mdash;that transect several lots of land
in the Holiday Beach neighborhood of
Owls Head. The lots are owned by the
Carters, the Voncannons, and the Rogerses.<fnr2>

<P20>[&para;3] The first of the two paper streets,
Austin Avenue, runs roughly north to
south and lies between the eastern boundary
of the Carter lot and the western
boundaries of the Voncannon lot and the
Rogers lot. The Voncannon lot and the
Rogers lot abut opposite sides of the second
paper street, referred to as "the Reserved
Way," which runs east to west. The
Voncannon lot and the Rogers lot are
<Page 17>
bounded to the east by Holiday Beach
Road. Provided here for illustrative purposes
only, <EM>Figure 1</EM> depicts the locations
of the lots and the paper streets.

<P00><IMAGE></IMAGE>

<P20>[&para;4] In its November 12, 2022, judgment,
the court found the following facts, which
are supported by competent record evidence.
<EM>See Fissmer v. Smith,</EM> 2019 ME
130, &para; 40, 214 A.3d 1054.

<HN00><EMB>A. Chain of Title</EMB>

<P20>[&para;5] The Holiday Beach neighborhood
was created out of a forty-acre tract that
was originally acquired by Daniel Pierce
via a deed (the Pierce deed) from Sarah
Perry on June 23, 1866. The Pierce tract
was bounded to the east by the high-water
mark of Owls Head Harbor, and to the
north by the line separating the neighborhood
from land formerly owned by Harrison
Emery, known as the Emery line.<fnr3> In
the 1880s, Pierce subdivided his property
and sold many of the resulting lots.

<P20>[&para;6] Pierce first conveyed a lot by deed
to J.H. Flint (the Flint deed) on July 3,
1884. Other lots in the area were later
located using references to the Flint lot.
The Flint lot is now part of the Voncannon
lot. The Flint deed described the northeast
corner of what is now the Voncannon lot as
located

<B22>[a]t a stake and stones in an angle
formed by the junction of two reserved
roads[,] one running on the westerly
shore of Owls Head [H]arbor, the other
running westerly from said shore road
parallel with the Harrison Emery line,
the point of junction being three hundred
and sixty[-]six feet from the Emery
line and two rods from the edge of the
bank; thence North 77 degrees West, or
parallel with the Emery line on the
south side of the second named reserved
street one hundred and three feet....

<P00>The road "running on the westerly shore"
is now Holiday Beach Road, and the reserved
<Page 18>
road "running westerly from said
shore road" is the Reserved Way.

<P20>[&para;7] Pierce later conveyed parcels by
deed to Benjamin Williams on August 22,
1884 (the 1884 Williams deed), and April
13, 1885 (the 1885 Williams deed). The
1884 Williams deed describes the southern
boundary of the Williams lot, which is now
part of the Rogers lot, as running "[e]asterly
by said reserved street [running parallel
to the said Emery line] one hundred
feet to first bound," with the first bound
being "three hundred and thirty-three feet
from the Emery line at the junction of two
reserved streets." The reserved street described
as running parallel to the Emery
line is the Reserved Way, meaning the
southern boundary of the Williams lot was
the northern edge of the Reserved Way,
located thirty-three feet, or two rods,
north of what is now the Voncannon lot.
Neither Pierce nor his successors in title
ever conveyed Austin Avenue or the Reserved
Way.

<P20>[&para;8] The Carters purchased their lot in
2010. The language in their deed describing
the lot originated in a deed dated
October 29, 1969, by which Sam Pipicello
conveyed parcels to Nelson R. and Dolores
K. Ells (the Ells deed).<fnr4> In relevant part,
the Ells deed conveyed

<B22>Lot[s] #4, #5, and the southwesterly
portion of Lot #6 as delineated on plan
of O.H. Tripp, C.E., entitled "Plan of
Cottage Lots at [Holiday] Beach, South
Thomaston, Maine, for sale by F.M.
Smith." [the Tripp plan]

<B22>....

<B22>ALSO, all my right, title and interest in
and to that portion of Austin Avenue,
said reserve for a way not being opened
and used, fronting and lying southeasterly
of the parcel of land hereinabove
conveyed. ALSO, all my right, title and
interest in and to a reserve for a way
delineated on the aforesaid O.H. Tripp
plan[,] which extends from Austin Avenue,
at a point opposite the line dividing
Lot #4 and Lot #5 aforesaid, to [Holiday
Beach Road] and the shore, said
reserve not being opened and used.

<P00>The Tripp plan referenced by the Ells
deed is a generalized schematic drawing of
much of the Holiday Beach neighborhood
and is reproduced in relevant part in <EM>Figure
2.</EM><fnr5>
<Page 19>

<P00><IMAGE></IMAGE>

<HN00><EMB>B. Usage of the Reserved Way</EMB>

<P20>[&para;9] Since 1980, the Voncannons and
their predecessors-in-title have used the
half of the Reserved Way abutting their
property as a driveway and the only entrance
to their property. Similarly, since
1934, the Rogerses and their predecessors-in-title
have used the half of the Reserved
Way abutting their property as a
driveway and the only entrance to their
property. The gravel driveways abut each
other at the Reserved Way's intersection
with Holiday Beach Road and then diverge
to provide access to the Voncannons'
and Rogerses' respective garages. Since
purchasing their lots, the Voncannons and
the Rogerses have always parked their
cars on, and maintained the gravel surface
on, their respective driveways.<fnr6> Since they
purchased their lot in 2008, the Voncannons
have also kept a backup generator on
land adjacent to their house that is designated
as the Reserved Way.

<P20>[&para;10] Since at least the 1960s, the Voncannons,
the Rogerses, and their predecessors
have used the western portion and
nongraveled eastern portion of the land
designated as the Reserved Way as part of
their yards, including by planting trees,
pruning tree limbs, installing and mowing
lawns, landscaping, planting and maintaining
flower and vegetable gardens, composting,
and using the area for picnics and
storage. On plans of the area dating back
to the late nineteenth century, the Voncannon
house appears to slightly encroach on
the Reserved Way. The Voncannons' and
the Rogerses' predecessors-in-title did not,
nor did they believe they needed to, seek
permission of the Carters or the Carters'
predecessors-in-title for these uses, and
they openly spoke and behaved as if they
each owned half of the Reserved Way.

<P20>[&para;11] In 1999, the Rogerses' predecessor
placed cinderblocks in the middle of the
Reserved Way to demarcate what she and
the Voncannons' predecessor considered to
<Page 20>
be the approximate boundary between
their properties; more recently, the Voncannons
and the Rogerses' predecessor
agreed to a precise centerline based in
part on land surveys. In 2019, the Carters
helped replace the cinder blocks that demarcated
the boundary line with stones.

<P20>[&para;12] The Carters regularly interacted
with the Voncannons' and Rogerses' predecessors
prior to purchasing their lot in
2010.<fnr7> In his youth, when John Carter was
in the area, he often mowed the lawn on
the part of the Reserved Way that the
Rogerses' predecessor believed was hers.
After purchasing the Carter lot, the Carters
requested the Rogerses' predecessor's
permission before clearing brush or trimming
the trees located on the Reserved
Way and stopped doing so when that permission
was withdrawn. Over the last ten
years, the Carters also made some limited
use of the Reserved Way as a path, mostly
after being invited to do so by the Voncannons'
or the Rogerses' predecessors-in-title.

<HN00><EMB>C. Usage of Austin Avenue</EMB>

<P20>[&para;13] Austin Avenue has been, for most
of its existence, an overgrown, natural
hedge between various properties. The
Ells deed described Austin Avenue as "not
being opened and used." As far back as the
late 1960s, the Voncannons' and the Rogerses'
predecessors considered Austin Avenue
their property to the centerline. Beginning
in 2016, the Voncannons' and the
Rogerses' predecessors cleared some of
the brush so that they could use their part
of Austin Avenue for planting lawns,
shrubs, and flowers. Prior to these improvements,
the Voncannons had made
some use of Austin Avenue by mowing
portions of it and maintaining a fenced-in
compost pile.

<P20>[&para;14] When the Carters began clearing
the hedges, also in 2016, they marked the
centerline of Austin Avenue with stakes
and directed their son to clear the brush
only to the west of those stakes. The Carters
asked for the Rogerses' predecessor's
permission before trimming trees beyond
the center line of Austin Avenue. The Carters
also assisted their neighbors in locating
the centerline, as John Carter had
measured it, and marked it with stones
and stakes. Then, in 2020, the Carters
claimed that they owned the entirety of
Austin Avenue.

<HN00><EMB>D. Procedural History</EMB>

<P20>[&para;15] The Carters filed a complaint in
the Superior Court on August 10, 2020,
and the case was transferred to the Business
and Consumer Docket on January 8,
2021. The Carters' second amended complaint,
filed on September 5, 2020, named
the Voncannons, the Rogerses, and two
other families as defendants and set forth
five counts. The second amended complaint
included a petition for declaratory
relief, a claim for trespass, a claim for
slander of title, a petition to quiet title, and
a claim for nuisance. The defendants filed
an answer and counterclaims on November
19, 2020, and filed an amended answer and
numerous counterclaims on February 5,
2021. The counterclaims included a petition
to quiet title and requests for declaratory
relief as to the ownership of the Reserved
Way and Austin Avenue, claiming that
they owned portions of those streets based
on the doctrines of adverse possession,
boundary by acquiescence, boundary by
parol agreement, boundary by practical location,
prescriptive easement, implied
<Page 21>
easement, or some combination of these
doctrines. In a second amended counterclaim
filed on May 20, 2021, the defendants
added another counterclaim seeking a
judgment declaring that they had deeded
title to portions of the paper streets.

<P20>[&para;16] The Carters settled their claims
against the parties other than the Voncannons
and the Rogerses at a judicial settlement
conference on February 22, 2022.
The court then held a five-day bench trial
on March 21-25, 2022, to address the remaining
claims. After receiving post-trial
briefs from the parties, the court issued its
judgment, entering judgment in part on
the Carters' claims and entering judgment
in part on the Voncannons' and Rogerses'
counterclaims.

<P20>[&para;17] The Court made several findings.
First, the court determined that the Carters
had full record title to Austin Avenue
and that the Voncannons' and Rogerses'
activities on Austin Avenue constituted
trespass. Second, after noting that the precise
location of the Emery line is ambiguous
and, consequently, so is the location of
the northeast corner of the Voncannon lot
(which is also the intersection of Holiday
Beach Road and the Reserved Way), the
court found that a survey by James Dorsky<fnr8>
accurately reflects the location of the
record Emery line, which was a straight
line, and the Voncannon lot. Third, after
concluding that the Carter deed is ambiguous
as to the terminus of the Reserved
Way, the court determined that the Reserved
Way terminates at Holiday Beach
Road and does not extend to the high-water
mark of Owls Head Harbor. Finally,
the court concluded that the Carter deed
conveyed the Reserved Way to the Carters,
but that the Voncannons and the
Rogerses had acquired title to the Reserved
Way by adverse possession.<fnr9> The
court declared that the Voncannons acquired
title to the southern half of the
Reserved Way and that the Rogerses acquired
title to the northern half of the
Reserved Way.

<P20>[&para;18] The Carters filed a notice of appeal
on August 31, 2022, and we dismissed the
appeal for lack of a final judgment. The
court later granted the Carters' motion for
entry of final judgment on December 12,
2022. The Carters timely appealed, alleging
that the trial court erred by concluding
that the Reserved Way does not extend to
the high-water mark of Owls Head Harbor
and by awarding title to half of the Reserved
Way to the Voncannons and the
other half to the Rogerses based on a
theory of adverse possession. The Voncannons
and Rogerses timely cross-appealed,
alleging that the trial court erred by denying
their claims for title to half of Austin
Avenue based on alternate theories of
boundary by parol agreement, practical location,
or acquiescence.

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<HN02><EMB>A. Southwestern Corner of Holiday
Beach Road and the Reserved Way
(Northeastern Corner of Voncannon
Lot)</EMB>

<P20>[&para;19] The Voncannons and Rogerses
contend that the court clearly erred in
determining the location of the southwestern
corner of Holiday Beach Road and the
<Page 22>
Reserved Way, which now serves as the
northeastern corner of the Voncannon lot.
They argue that the court misapprehended
the location of the record Emery line when
it concluded that the Emery line extends
straight along a single bearing from its
point of beginning at the intersection with
Holiday Beach Road.

<P20>[&para;20] "Determination of where
the boundary lies on the surface of the
earth is a question of fact that we review
for clear error. A finding of fact is clearly
erroneous when[] (1) no competent evidence
supporting the finding exists in the
record; (2) the fact-finder clearly misapprehended
the meaning of the evidence; or
(3) the force and effect of the evidence,
taken as a whole, rationally persuades us
to a certainty that the finding is so against
the great preponderance of the believable
evidence that it does not represent the
truth and right of the case." <EM>Wells v. Powers,</EM>
2005 ME 62, &para; 2, 873 A.2d 361 (citation
omitted).

<P20>[&para;21] The court thoughtfully weighed expert
testimony, examined language in the
Pierce deed, and reviewed historical documents
to support its conclusion that the
Dorsky Survey, as revised March 1, 2022,
accurately reflects the location of the record
Emery line and, consequently, the
southwestern corner of Holiday Beach
Road and the Reserved Way. Contrary to
the Voncannons and Rogerses' argument,
we discern no clear error in the court's
determination.

<HN02><EMB>B. Terminus of the Reserved Way</EMB>

<P20>[&para;22] The Carters claim that the Carter
deed's description of the Reserved Way
unambiguously includes the land up to the
high-water mark, and that even if the Carter
deed is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence
of the grantor's intent&mdash;namely the grantor's
description, in an unrelated deed, of
the Reserved Way's terminus&mdash;supports
their position. The Voncannons and Rogerses
contend that the Carter deed contains
a patent ambiguity because the deed
indicates that the Reserved Way ends at
two different points&mdash;"Ocean Drive" and
"the shore"&mdash;and urge the use of extrinsic
evidence, in particular the Tripp plan and
the Flint deed, to conclude that the Reserved
Way ends at the western boundary
of Holiday Beach Road.

<P20>[&para;23] We "review de novo the
interpretation of a deed and the intent of
the parties who created it, including
whether the deed contains an ambiguity."
<EM>Mabee v. Nordic Aquafarms Inc.,</EM> 2023
ME 15, &para; 26, 290 A.3d 79 (quotation marks
omitted). "When interpreting a deed whose
terms are not ambiguous, we do not speculate
about the grantors' actual or probable
objectives; rather, we focus on what is
expressed within the four corners of the
deed." <EM>Sleeper v. Loring,</EM> 2013 ME 112,
&para; 16, 83 A.3d 769. The "four corners of the
deed" includes the entirety of plans referenced
by the deed. <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 13.

<P20>[&para;24] A deed is patently ambiguous
if, within the four corners of the deed,
there are multiple reasonable interpretations
of the language. <EM>Beckerman v. Conant,</EM>
2017 ME 142, &para; 13, 166 A.3d 1006.
We may resolve a patently ambiguous
deed by examining the deed itself, the
circumstances of the grant, and the intentions
of the parties. <EM>See Barron v. Boynton,</EM>
137 Me. 69, 71-72, 15 A.2d 191, 193
(1940).

<P20>[&para;25] The language conveying the Reserved
Way in the Carter deed states,

<B22>ALSO, all my right, title and interest in
and to [the Reserved Way] delineated on
the aforesaid O.H. Tripp plan which extends
from Austin Avenue, at a point
opposite the line dividing Lot #4 and
Lot #5 aforesaid, <EM>to [Holiday Beach</EM>
<Page 23>
<EM>Road] and the shore,</EM> said reserve not
being opened and used.

<P00>(Emphasis added.)

<P20>[&para;26] "`To' is a word of exclusion.
A line running `to' an object excludes that
object." <EM>Mabee,</EM> 2023 ME 15, &para; 32, 290 A.
3d 79 (quotation marks, citation, and alteration
omitted). The term "shore" refers to
"the land lying between the lines of the
high water and low water over which the
tide ebbs and flows." <EM>Almeder v. Town of
Kennebunkport,</EM> 2019 ME 151, &para; 8, 217
A.3d 1111 (quotation marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;27] We first review whether
the Carter deed's description of the Reserved
Way is ambiguous. The deed describes
the Reserved Way as beginning at
Austin Avenue and extending "to [Holiday
Beach Road] and the shore." The deed
language is ambiguous&mdash;that is, subject to
multiple reasonable interpretations&mdash;because
it is unclear whether the Reserved
Way ends at the eastern boundary of Holiday
Beach Road or extends over Holiday
Beach Road to terminate at the eastern
boundary of the shore. Because the deed
language is ambiguous as to the terminus
of the Reserved Way, we must construe
the grant. <EM>See McLellan v. McFadden,</EM> 114
Me. 242, 246, 95 A. 1025, 1028 (1915). "In
construing the grant we are to give effect,
if possible, to the intention of the parties,
so far as it can be ascertained in accordance
with legal canons of interpretation."
<EM>Id.</EM> Here, the grantor's intent is manifested
most clearly in the first clause of the conveyance:
"ALSO, all my right, title and
interest in and to [the Reserved Way]
delineated on the aforesaid O.H. Tripp
plan...." Our interpretation of the grant
terminating at the western side of Holiday
Beach Road coheres with the conveyor's
intent to convey land for a road that would
connect what is now the Carter lot with
Holiday Beach Road; any interpretation of
the deed as conveying land <EM>beyond</EM> Holiday
Beach Road to the high-water mark would
be contrary to an ordinary reading of the
language of the transfer.

<P20>[&para;28] Two pieces of historic extrinsic
evidence support this interpretation: first,
the deed's reference to the Tripp plan,
which depicted the Reserved Way as a
planned road extending from the Carter
lot toward Holiday Beach Road; and second,
the Flint deed, which included the
first recorded description of the Reserved
Way and described the road as "running
westerly from [Holiday Beach Road]."<fnr10>
The court therefore correctly determined
that the Reserved Way terminates at its
intersection with Holiday Beach Road and
does not extend to the high-water mark.

<HN02><EMB>C. Adverse Possession of the Reserved
Way</EMB>

<P20>[&para;29] The Carters argue that the court
erred as a matter of law by determining
that the Voncannons and Rogerses had
each obtained title by adverse possession
to the centerline of the Reserved Way
adjacent to their respective properties.

<P20>[&para;30] "Adverse possession
presents a mixed question of fact and law."
<EM>Fissmer,</EM> 2019 ME 130, &para; 40, 214 A.3d
1054. We "review a trial court's factual
findings regarding adverse possession for
clear error and will affirm those facts if
they are supported by competent record
evidence." <EM>Id.</EM> In cases like the one before
us, where no party has moved for additional
findings of fact pursuant to M.R. Civ. P.
52(b), "we will infer that the court made all
findings necessary to support its conclusions."
<Page 24>
<EM>Weeks v. Krysa,</EM> 2008 ME 120, &para; 11,
955 A.2d 234; <EM>D'Angelo v. McNutt,</EM> 2005
ME 31, &para;&para; 6, 8, 868 A.2d 239.<fnr11> Whether
the express findings and the inferred findings
necessary to the court's conclusions,
supported by competent record evidence,
constitute adverse possession is an issue of
law that we review de novo. <EM>See Fissmer,</EM>
2019 ME 130, &para; 40, 214 A.3d 1054; <EM>Weeks,</EM>
2008 ME 120, &para; 11, 955 A.2d 234.

<P20>[&para;31] "A party claiming title by
adverse possession has the burden of proving,
by a preponderance of the evidence,
that possession and use of the property
was (1) actual; (2) open; (3) visible; (4)
notorious; (5) hostile; (6) under a claim of
right; (7) continuous; (8) exclusive; and (9)
for a duration exceeding the twenty-year
limitations period." <EM>Fissmer,</EM> 2019 ME 130,
&para; 41, 214 A.3d 1054 (quotation marks omitted).
"The elements of adverse possession
must be established by clear proof of acts
and conduct sufficient to put a person of
ordinary prudence, and particularly the
true owner, on notice that the land in
question is actually, visibly, and exclusively
held by a claimant in antagonistic purpose."
<EM>Weeks,</EM> 2008 ME 120, &para; 13, 955 A.2d
234 (quotation marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;32] The dispute in this case is
whether the Voncannons' and Rogerses'
uses of the Reserved Way were actual,
hostile, under a claim of right, and exclusive;
if any one of these elements is not
met, their claim of adverse possession fails.
<EM>See Fissmer,</EM> 2019 ME 130, &para; 41, 214 A.3d
1054; <EM>Me. Gravel Servs., Inc. v. Haining,</EM>
1998 ME 18, &para; 3, 704 A.2d 417 (requiring
that all elements of possession and use be
satisfied "for a period of at least twenty
years" to prove adverse possession).

<P20>[&para;33] In the context of adverse
possession, "`[h]ostile' simply means that
the possessor does not have the true owner's
permission to be on the land, and has
nothing to do with demonstrating a heated
controversy or a manifestation of ill will, or
that the claimant was in any sense an
enemy of the owner of the servient estate."
<EM>Dombkowski v. Ferland,</EM> 2006 ME 24, &para; 12,
893 A.2d 599 (quotation marks omitted).
Hostile activities by a possessor must be
undertaken to dispossess the true owner of
property rights. <EM>See Cent. Me. Power Co.
v. Rollins,</EM> 126 Me. 299, 301-02, 138 A. 170,
172-73 (1927). However, any use that falls
within a possessor's legal entitlement is
not considered hostile for the purpose of
proving adverse possession. <EM>See Mill Pond
Condo. Ass'n v. Manalio,</EM> 2006 ME 135,
&para; 9, 910 A.2d 392.

<P20>[&para;34] The conduct that constitutes
hostile use is specific to the land in
question and the attendant circumstances.
<EM>Weeks,</EM> 2008 ME 120, &para; 13, 955 A.2d 234.
For instance, using a true owner's undeveloped
land for recreational activities and
access to a stream and to other lots is not
sufficient to prove hostility. <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 17.
"[S]easonal playing on and crossing over a
[disputed] lot" and occasionally gardening
on a disputed lot are not hostile activities
because they do not put a true owner on
notice that the owner's property rights are
in jeopardy. <EM>See id.</EM> &para;&para; 17-18; <EM>Falvo v.

<P20>[&para;35] The Carters contend that
the Voncannons and the Rogerses hold an
implied access easement over the Reserved

Way.<fnr12> <EM>See Beckwith v. Rossi,</EM> 157

...." <EM>Hamlin v. Niedner,</EM> 2008 ME 130,
&para; 12, 955 A.2d 251. Thus, an implied easement
for the benefit of the Voncannons
and the Rogerses to use and maintain the
Reserved Way for access to their lots
would not be hostile to the Carters. <EM>See
Mill Pond Condo. Ass'n,</EM> 2006 ME 135, &para; 9,

<P20>[&para;36] "We have recognized two
types of implied easements: implied easements
by necessity and implied easements
created by, or arising from, a prior quasi-easement."
<EM>Northland Realty, LLC v.
Crawford,</EM> 2008 ME 92, &para; 12, 953 A.2d 359.
An easement by necessity is created when

<B22>a grantor conveys a lot of land from a
larger parcel, and that <EM>conveyed</EM> lot is
"landlocked" by the grantor's surrounding
land and cannot be accessed from a
road or highway. Because of the strict
necessity of having access to the landlocked
parcel, an easement over the
<EM>grantor's remaining land</EM> benefitting
the landlocked lot is implied as a matter
of law irrespective of the true intent of
the common grantor.

<B22>... [W]e have consistently stated that
the creation of an easement by necessity
depends on three elements: (1) the conveyance
of a lot out of a larger parcel;
(2) a lack for all practical purposes of
access to the <EM>conveyed lot;</EM> and (3) the
availability of relief in the form of an
easement across the <EM>retained land</EM> of
the conveyor or the conveyor's successor
in title. The creation of an easement by
necessity does not depend on any preexisting
use of the land or on the intent of
the grantor at the time of the conveyance.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> (citations and quotation marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;37] By contrast, "the creation
of an implied easement by a prior
quasi-easement depends on [] a preexisting
use of the land," the intent of the
grantor at the time of conveyance, and,
following the severance, the use of the
retained land by the grantee through what
was a quasi-easement as a true easement.
<EM>Id.</EM> &para; 13. An implied easement by a prior
quasi-easement arises when:

<B22>(1) the property when in single ownership
[was] openly used in a manner constituting
a "quasi-easement," as existing
conditions on the retained land that are
apparent and observable and the retention
of which would clearly benefit the
land conveyed; (2) <EM>the common grantor,
who severed unity of title, ... manifested
an intent that the quasi-easement
should continue as a true easement, to
burden the retained land and to benefit
the conveyed land</EM>; and (3) the owners of
the conveyed land ... continued to use
what had been a quasi-easement as a
true easement.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> (emphasis added) (quotation marks and
citations omitted).

<P20>[&para;38] Here, the Voncannons, the
Rogerses, and their predecessors-in-title
do not have an implied easement by necessity
because they do not have a lack "for
all practical purposes" of access to their
lots. <EM>See id.</EM> &para; 12 (quotation marks omitted).
Both lots have frontage on Holiday
Beach Road and could be reached via that
public road without using the Reserved
Way. <EM>See id.</EM> In fact, prior to 1980, the
Voncannons' predecessors did not use the
<Page 26>
Reserved Way for ingress and egress between
their lot and Holiday Beach Road.

<P20>[&para;39] The determination of a prior
quasi-easement is dependent upon the
demonstration of (a) the use of the land
before severance of the unity of title, (b)
the intent of the grantor when the severance
occurred, and (c) the grantee's continued
use of the grantor's land following the
severance. <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 13. The record here demonstrates
that Pierce intended to retain
the fee title to the Reserved Way, as it was
never conveyed to any of the abutters by
Pierce or by any of his successors in title.
The record in this case does not indicate
the use made of the Reserved Way prior
to 1884, when Pierce conveyed to Flint and
Williams the properties that are now part
of the Voncannons' and Rogerses' respective
lots. It does not reflect that Pierce
intended for the land he retained to continue
to be used for some quasi-easement
that existed before the severance of title.
Nor does the record establish that after
the conveyances to Flint and Williams the
land retained by Pierce was subject to
continued use by the grantees for a quasi-easement
that existed previously. On this
record, the Voncannons and the Rogerses
would not have an implied easement to use
the Reserved Way for access. <EM>See id.</EM> &para; 15
(where there is no evidence of grantor's
intent to retain a quasi-easement, the
proper conclusion is that no implied easement
has been created); <EM>see also Frederick
v. Consol. Waste Servs., Inc.,</EM> 573 A.2d 387,
389-390 (Me. 1990) (concluding that because
the lot created when the unity of
title was severed had access to a town way,
there was a strong suggestion that the
grantor had no reason, and thus no intent,
to create an implied easement over the
grantor's retained land to benefit the new
lot).

<P20>[&para;40] Contrary to the Carters'
contention, the Voncannons, the Rogerses,
and their predecessors did not have either
an implied easement by necessity or an
implied easement arising from a prior quasi-easement.
In the absence of an implied
easement, the Voncannons' and their predecessors'
use of the southern half of the
Reserved Way for access to their lot since
the early 1980s has been hostile to the
Carters' fee ownership of the Reserved
Way. <EM>See Northland Realty, LLC,</EM> 2008
ME 92, &para; 18, 953 A.2d 359. Without the
benefit of an implied easement, the Rogerses'
and their predecessors' use of the
northern half of the Reserved Way for
access to their lot since the 1930s has been
hostile to the Carters' fee ownership of the
Reserved Way. <EM>See id.</EM> Similarly, any
maintenance or demarcation of the Reserved
Way to facilitate the Voncannons',
the Rogerses', and their predecessors' access
to their respective lots also would be
hostile to the Carters. <EM>See id.</EM>

<P20>[&para;41] The Voncannons, the Rogerses,
and their predecessors also used the western
portion and nongraveled eastern portion
of the Reserved Way as part of their
respective yards, including by planting
trees, pruning tree limbs, installing and
mowing lawns, landscaping, planting and
maintaining flower and vegetable gardens,
composting, picnicking, and storage. The
Voncannons, Rogerses, and their predecessors
did not seek permission from the Carters
or their predecessors-in-title for their
use of the Reserved Way. This open conduct
by the Voncannons, Rogerses, and
their predecessors, combined with the obvious
physical manifestations of such use,
demonstrated a hostile intention sufficient
to give notice to the Carters, and their
predecessors-in-title, that their rights to
the Reserved Way were in jeopardy. <EM>See
Weeks,</EM> 2008 ME 120, &para; 13, 955 A.2d 234.
We conclude that the Voncannons' and
Rogerses' and their predecessors' use of
<Page 27>
Reserved Way was hostile to the true owners
&mdash;the Carters and their predecessors.

<P20>[&para;42] The Carters also contend
that the court erred by awarding ownership
of portions of the Reserved Way to
the Voncannons and the Rogerses without
record evidence of actual occupation of
those portions of the Reserved Way by
them. "Actual possession means physical
occupancy or control over property" and
"is established when the evidence shows an
actual use and enjoyment of the property
that is in kind and degree the same as the
use and enjoyment to be expected of the
average owner of such property." <EM>Fissmer,</EM>
2019 ME 130, &para; 42, 214 A.3d 1054 (citation
omitted). As noted <EM>supra</EM> &para;&para; 9, 10, 41, the
Voncannons, the Rogerses, and their predecessors-in-title
have used, traversed, improved,
maintained, and demarcated their
halves of the Reserved Way from where it
abuts their respective lots to its centerline.
Thus, we agree with the trial court that
their use, occupancy, and control of their
respective halves of the Reserved Way was
actual. <EM>See Fissmer,</EM> 2019 ME 130, &para; 44,
214 A.3d 1054.

<P20>[&para;43] The Carters further argue
that the court erred as a matter of law
by determining that the Voncannons and
Rogerses jointly demonstrated exclusive
use and possession of the Reserved Way
because "[t]here is no authority to support
the proposition that multiple parties can
jointly use or occupy land to obtain title by
adverse possession...." "`Exclusive' possession
and use means that the possessor
is not sharing the disputed property with
the true owner or public at large." <EM>Striefel
v. Charles-Keyt-Leaman P'ship,</EM> 1999 ME
111, &para; 17, 733 A.2d 984.

<P20>[&para;44] The record evidence reflects that
the Voncannons, the Rogerses, and their
predecessors-in-title at times disputed
where the centerline of the Reserved Way
abutting their lots was located but resolved
these disputes with the assistance of surveyors.
The record evidence further suggests
that the Voncannons, the Rogerses,
and their predecessors-in-title on occasion
gave others, including the neighbor in possession
of the other half of the Reserved
Way, permission to use or help maintain
their half of the Reserved Way. <EM>See Grimstad
v. Dordan,</EM> 256 Or. 135, 471 P.2d 778,
781 (1970) (holding that possession of
property in regard to an adverse possession
claim does not have to be absolutely
exclusive if the possession is of the kind
expected of an owner under the circumstances,
such that a disseisor may give
permission to others to make some use of
the subject property); <EM>Bensdorff v. Uihlein,</EM>
132 Tenn. 193, 177 S.W. 481, 483
(1915) (holding that mere use of property
with the permission of the disseisor will
not destroy the disseisor's adverse possession
claim); <EM>Peveto v. Herring,</EM> 198 S.W.2d
921, 925 (Tex. Civ. App. 1946) (holding that
use of a lot by others in subordination to
disseisor's claim and made with disseisor's
consent does not affect the exclusiveness
of disseisor's possession). The Voncannons,
the Rogerses, and their predecessors-in-title
did not share their portions of the
Reserved Way with each other, the true
owner, or the public at large. <EM>See Striefel,</EM>
1999 ME 111, &para; 17, n.10, 733 A.2d 984
("Exclusive possession by [an] adverse
possessor means that [the] adverse possessor
must show an exclusive dominion over
the land and an appropriation of it for his
own use and benefit, and not for another"
(quotation marks omitted)). The record
does not reflect that the Voncannons, the
Rogerses, or their predecessors-in-title
made a claim of possession or ownership
beyond the agreed-upon centerline dividing
the Reserved Way. The record thus
supports the court's finding that the Voncannons',
the Rogerses', and their predecessors'
use and possession of their respective
<Page 28>
halves of the Reserved Way were
exclusive throughout the limitations period.<fnr13>
<EM>See id.</EM> &para; 17.

<P20>[&para;45] Finally, the Carters contend
that there is no evidence in the record
to support the court's ruling that the
Voncannons and the Rogerses were proceeding
under a claim of right&mdash;that is,
they each acted as owner of their respective
halves of the Reserved Way. <EM>See Harvey
v. Furrow,</EM> 2014 ME 149, &para; 15, 107
A.3d 604. "Under a claim of right means
that the claimant is in possession as owner,
with intent to claim the land as [her or his]
own, and not in recognition of or subordination
to the record title owner." <EM>Id.</EM> Here,
there is no legitimate dispute that the
Voncannons, the Rogerses, and their respective
predecessors have used their
halves of the Reserved Way as if they
owned them and that their use of their
respective halves of the Reserved Way was
not undertaken in subordination to the
Carters' claim of fee title to the Reserved
Way. <EM>See id.</EM>

<P20>[&para;46] We therefore affirm the
court's judgment that the Voncannons and
the Rogerses each adversely possessed the
half of the Reserved Way abutting their
respective lots. <EM>See Northland Realty,
LLC,</EM> 2008 ME 92, &para; 20, 953 A.2d 359.<fnr14>

<HN02><EMB>D. Rights to Austin Avenue</EMB>

<P20>[&para;47] The Voncannons and Rogerses
cross-appeal and argue that the
court erred when it determined that the
evidence was insufficient to prove that the
western boundary lines of their respective
properties extended to the centerline of
Austin Avenue by parol agreement, practical
location, or acquiescence. The doctrines
of boundary by parol agreement,
practical location, and acquiescence are
common-law concepts drawn from the
principle of estoppel, though each requires
slightly different showings. <EM>See generally</EM>
George L. Blum, Annotation, <EM>Application
of Practical Location Doctrine in Establishing
Boundary Line,</EM> 91 A.L.R.6th 1
(2014). Determination of the location of a
boundary under any of these theories is a
question of fact that we review for clear
error. <EM>See Dupont v. Randall,</EM> 648 A.2d
437, 438 (Me. 1994) ("The parties did not
dispute the legal boundary; they disputed
the location of that boundary and in such a
case a factual finding will not be disturbed
on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous.");
<EM>Calthorpe v. Abrahamson,</EM> 441 A.2d 284,
288 (Me. 1982).

<P20>[&para;48] "[W]here parties are in
doubt as to where the true division line []
<Page 30>
of their lands may be, they may fix it by
parol agreement which would be mutually
binding on them." <EM>Steinherz v. Wilson,</EM>
1998 ME 22, &para; 13, 705 A.2d 710 (quotation
marks omitted). In contrast, boundary by
practical location requires only a mutual
understanding that a boundary is being
created in combination with the establishment
of physical markers on the face of
the earth, like erecting a fence or building
monuments. <EM>See Proctor v. Libby,</EM> 110 Me.
39, 42, 85 A. 298, 299 (1912); <EM>Little Ossipee
River Dev. v. White Bros., Inc.,</EM> No. Civ.A.
RE-03-78, 2005 WL 3678035, at *3-5 (Me.
Super. Ct. Nov. 28, 2005); 2 <EM>Tiffany Real
Property</EM> &sect; 655 (3d ed. 2023). To find a
boundary by acquiescence, a party must
prove by clear and convincing evidence
"(1) possession up to a visible line marked
clearly by monuments, fences or the like;
(2) actual or constructive notice to the
adjoining landowner of the possession; (3)
conduct by the adjoining landowner from
which recognition and acquiescence not induced
by fraud or mistake may be fairly
inferred; (4) acquiescence for a long period
of years such that the policy behind the
doctrine of acquiescence is well-served by
recognizing the boundary." <EM>Calthorpe,</EM> 441
A.2d at 289. Unlike boundary by parol
agreement and practical location, acquiescence
does not require proof of agreement
or mutual understanding. <EM>See id.</EM>

<P20>[&para;49] Here, the court found,
supported by competent evidence, that

<B22>as far back as the late 1960s, the owners
of the Vo[n]cannon lot considered
[Austin Avenue] their property to the
centerline, as did the Rogers[es'] predecessor[-]in[-]title.
When [John] Carter
began clearing brush in 2016, he believed
he only had rights on the west
half, so he first measured to Austin Avenue's
centerline, marked it with stakes,
and directed his son to only clear brush
on the west side. He asked permission
from [the Rogerses' predecessor] before
trimming trees beyond the centerline.
[John] Carter assisted his abutting
neighbors&mdash;the Voncannons, Graners,
and [the Rogerses' predecessor]&mdash;in locating
the centerline, as he had measured
it, and the[n] marking it with
stones and stakes. The neighbors
cleared some brush as well so they
could also use Austin Avenue for planting
lawns, shrubs, and flowers. Prior to
these activities, which began in 2016,
the Voncannons had made some use of
Austin Avenue by maintaining a fenced
in compost pile and mowing portions of
it. It was only in 2020, in the leadup to
the instant action, that [John] Carter
expressed his belief that his family
owned both halves of Austin Avenue.

<P00>There were no findings of an oral agreement
to change the location of the boundary,
nor a mutual understanding that the
boundary was changed. The court also
found no clear and convincing evidence
that the Carters or their predecessors-in-title
acquiesced to the centerline of Austin
Avenue being the boundary of their property
for a long period of years, noting that,
prior to the Carters creating a visible line
by placing stakes at the centerline in 2016,
Austin Avenue was an overgrown, natural
hedge. The court thus did not clearly err
in determining that the Voncannons and
Rogerses do not have possession of Austin
Avenue through boundary by practical location,
parol agreement, or acquiescence.

<CN><EMB>III. CONCLUSION</EMB>

<P20>[&para;50] We therefore affirm the judgment
awarding the southern half of the Reserved
Way to the Voncannons and the
northern half of the Reserved Way to the
Rogerses because we determine that they
fulfilled each of the necessary elements of
adverse possession. We also affirm the
judgments determining that the location of
<Page 31>
the southwestern corner of Holiday Beach
Road and the Reserved Way is accurately
reflected by the revised Dorsky survey,
that the Reserved Way does not extend to
the high-water mark of Owls Head Harbor,
and that the Voncannons and Rogerses
did not establish title to any part of
Austin Avenue under any common-law theory.

<P20>The entry is:

<P20>Judgment affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt*> Although Justice Jabar participated in this appeal,
he retired before this opinion was certified.

<fnt1> A paper street is "a thoroughfare that appears
on plats, subdivision maps, and other
publicly filed documents, but that has not
been completed or opened for public use."
<EM>Street,</EM> Black's Law Dictionary (12th ed.
2024).

<fnt2> George Graner, Mary Graner, Steven A.
Comiskey, and Nancy L. Comiskey, other lot
owners in the Holiday Beach neighborhood,
were originally parties in this case; they
reached a settlement with the Carters on February
22, 2022. The Graner lot is located
immediately south of the Voncannon lot, and
the Comiskey lot is located immediately north
of the Rogers lot. The Graner lot and Comiskey
lot are located east of the Carter lot, and
they are separated from the Carter lot by one
of the paper streets at issue in this case,
Austin Avenue. <EM>See infra Figure 1.</EM>

<fnt3> The Pierce deed describes the Emery line as
"[b]eginning at stake and stones at high water
mark on the west side of Owls Head Harbor;
thence North 76 1/2 degrees West 91 rods to
the center of the town road." At some point, a
stone wall was built in the approximate location
of the Emery line, but that wall is now
bowed and crooked in multiple locations. Although
the Pierce deed provides a single bearing
and length for the Emery line, it does not
make any reference to any physical marker
beyond a "stake" and "stones."

<fnt4> Sam Pipicello's predecessor-in-title acquired
the remainder of Pierce's land that had
not yet been deeded out in 1918, including
title extending to the high-water mark along
Holiday Beach Road, part of which the Carters
now claim was included in their conveyance.

<fnt5> The Tripp plan does not contain any measurements,
angles, or bearings. It depicts the
Reserved Way as extending east from Austin
Avenue toward the shore, and while its eastern
terminus is not clearly marked, the parallel
lines representing the paper street end just
above the words "Ocean Drive," which is the
area where Holiday Beach Road is currently
located. The Tripp plan does not show where
the Reserved Way reaches the waters at Owls
Head Harbor, nor does it show the Reserved
Way as definitively terminating there.

<fnt6> On occasion, the Voncannons and the Rogerses,
and their predecessors-in-title, gave
each other permission to park vehicles in the
other neighbor's driveway (for example, to
accommodate multiple visitors or to facilitate
snowplowing).

<fnt7> The court appears to have made a clerical
error in its finding that John Carter stayed
with the Rogerses' predecessor and her family.
John Carter testified at trial that the Carters
were regular guests of the <EM>Voncannons</EM>'
predecessor.

<fnt8> The Dorsky survey is a boundary survey
dated July 1, 2020, and revised March 1,
2022, entered in evidence at trial. The court
heard expert testimony from Dorsky.

<fnt9> The Carters did not dispute either that the
Voncannons and the Rogerses have an implied
right to continue to use the Reserved
Way for the limited purposes of parking and
access to their homes or that the Voncannons
have ownership of the portion of the Reserved
Way on which a portion of their house sits.

<fnt10> The Flint deed made no reference to the
shore or land east of what is now Holiday
Beach Road.

<fnt11> In these cases, which were decided prior
to the 2014 amendments to M.R. Civ. P. 52,
parties relied on Rule 52(a) to request that the
court make additional findings of fact. <EM>See
Weeks v. Krysa,</EM> 2008 ME 120, &para; 11, 955 A.2d
234; <EM>D'Angelo v. McNutt,</EM> 2005 ME 31, &para;&para; 6, 8,
868 A.2d 239; M.R. Civ. P. 52 Advisory
Note &mdash; June 2014. Parties requesting amended
or additional findings now do so pursuant
to Rule 52(b).

<fnt12> The trial court order also indicates that the
slight physical encroachment of the Voncannons'
home onto the Reserved Way is not
disputed by the Carters, and no party raised
this issue on appeal.

<fnt13> To the extent that the Rogerses traveled
over the part of the Voncannons' half of the
Reserved Way to access their garage, that use
was both with the Voncannons' permission
and de minimis.

<fnt14> The Carters make two additional arguments
as to why the Voncannons do not own
the southern half of the Reserved Way and the
Rogerses do not own the northern half of the
Reserved Way. The Carters contend that the
Reserved Way is a proposed, unaccepted way
over which the Voncannons, the Rogerses,
and their respective predecessors hold an
easement by estoppel as the source deeds in
their respective chains of title describe their
lots as bounded by the Reserved Way and
thus afford them a private right-of-way over
the Reserved Way. <EM>See Frederick v. Consol.
Waste Servs., Inc.,</EM> 573 A.2d 387, 390 n.4 (Me.
1990) ("We have recognized under a theory of
estoppel that easements may be created by
implication when a grantor's conveyance describes
land as bounded by a street or road.").
In addition, they note that the Reserved Way
is shown on the recorded Tripp plan as a
proposed, accepted way and likely confers a
private right-of-way over the Reserved Way to
the owners of lots shown on the plan. 23
M.R.S. &sect; 3031(2) (2024) ("A person acquiring
title to land shown on a subdivision plan
recorded in the registry of deeds acquires a
private right-of-way over the ways laid out on
the plan."). The Carters maintain that for
these reasons, the use of the Reserved Way by
the Voncannons, the Rogerses, and their predecessors-in-title
negates the element of hostility
and precludes their acquisition of title by
adverse possession. <EM>See Mill Pond Condo.
Ass'n v. Manalio,</EM> 2006 ME 135, &para; 9, 910 A.2d
392 (concluding that if a claimant's use and
maintenance of land are consistent with the
claimant's rights of access over that land,
there is no hostility for the purposes of an
adverse possession claim).

<P20>We find these arguments unpersuasive.
Even if the Voncannons and the Rogerses
were afforded a right of way over the Reserved
Way, as noted <EM>supra</EM> &para;&para; 9, 10, 41, the
Voncannons, the Rogerses, and their predecessors
used the western portion and non-graveled
eastern portion of the Reserved Way
for far more than a simple right of way. They
did not seek the permission of the Carters or
their predecessors-in-title in regard to that
use, which was open and obvious, such that it
sufficiently demonstrated a hostile intention
to the Carters and their predecessors.

<P20>Moreover, pursuant to section 3032, a proposed,
unaccepted way or portion of a proposed,
unaccepted way laid out on a subdivision
plan recorded prior to September 29,
1987, is deemed vacated if, as in this case,
"by the later of 15 years after the date of the
recording of the subdivision plan laying out
the way or portion of the way or September
29, 1997, both of the following conditions
have been met: (A) The way or portion of the
way has not been constructed or used as a
way; and (B) The way or portion of the way
has not been accepted as a town, county or
state way or highway or as a public, utility or
recreational easement. A way or portion of a
way considered vacated under this subsection
is subject to section 3033." 23 M.R.S.
&sect; 3032(1-A) (2024). Pursuant to section 3033,
a person claiming ownership of a proposed,
unaccepted way deemed vacated under section
3032 may record in the registry of deeds
a notice of the claim and must mail any
recorded notice to the current record owners
and mortgagees of the lots in the subdivision.
23 M.R.S. &sect; 3033(1) (2024). Once they receive
such notice, all persons who claim any
private right of any kind in the way are forever
barred from maintaining any action regarding
their rights unless they file a statement,
under oath, of any claimed interest in
the way in the registry of deeds within one
year from the date of recording of the notice.
<EM>Id.</EM> at &sect; 3033(2). Based on the record, it
seems that none of the parties recorded, sent
notice of, or filed an appropriate statement of
claimed interest in the registry of deeds.
Therefore, we apply the second paragraph of
section 3031(2), which we have held applies
retroactively to conveyances prior to 1987,
<EM>see Carignan v. Dumas,</EM> 2017 ME 15, &para; 19,
154 A.3d 629, to conclude that the title of the
fee interest passes to the Voncannons and the
Rogerses, each to the centerline of the way:
"when the private rights established by this
subsection are terminated as provided in this
subsection or by order of vacation by the municipality,
the title of the fee interest in the
proposed, unaccepted way for which the private
rights-of-way have terminated passes to
the abutting property owners to the centerline
of the way." 23 M.R.S. &sect; 3031(2) (2024).

<P20>For any conveyance made before September
29, 1987, which conveyed land abutting a
proposed, unaccepted way on a recorded subdivision
plan, section 469-A requires the
grantor to expressly reserve the grantor's title
to the way by a specific reference to the
reservation of title in the deed of conveyance,
otherwise the grantor will be deemed to have
conveyed all of the grantor's interest in the
portion of the way abutting the conveyed
land. 33 M.R.S. &sect; 469-A(1) (2024).

<P20>For any conveyance made before September
29, 1987, which conveyed land abutting a
proposed, unaccepted way on a recorded subdivision
plan, where the grantor intended to
reserve the grantor's title to the way but did
not expressly reserve title in the deed of conveyance,
section 469-A requires the grantor,
or any person claiming title to the way, by,
through, or under the grantor, to preserve the
grantor's claim by recording a notice in the
registry of deeds where the plan is recorded
by September 29, 1989, otherwise the grantor
will be deemed to have conveyed all of the
grantor's interest in the portion of the way
abutting the conveyed land. 33 M.R.S. &sect; 469-A(2).

<P20>The record in this case does not reflect that
the Reserved Way was ever accepted by the
Town of Owls Head or constructed in accordance
with section 3032(1-A), that any of the
parties pursued an interest in the Reserved
Way in accordance with section 3033, that the
deeds in the chains of title to the Voncannons
and the Rogerses contained the express reservation
of title to the Reserved Way required
by section 469-A(1), or that the notice required
by section 469-A(2) was ever recorded
in the registry of deeds. Thus, under the Carters'
contentions, the fee title to the Reserved
Way passed to the Voncannons' and the Rogerses'
predecessors-in-title pursuant to section
469-A(2).

<P20>[&para;1] Carol L. Brewer appeals from a
judgment of the District Court (Bangor,
<EM>Szylvian, J.</EM>) modifying the parties' divorce
judgment to terminate the $2,000 per
month in general spousal support that the
judgment had required John A. Jewell Sr.
to pay to Brewer. Brewer argues that the
court erred in considering events occurring
and circumstances existing before the
most recently preceding final judgment in
finding a substantial change in circumstances,
and in terminating spousal support
based in part on findings regarding
the parties' earning capacities that lacked
evidentiary support. We agree with Brewer
that there was no evidentiary support
for the court's finding that Brewer has the
capacity to earn income. Accordingly, we
vacate the judgment and remand for the
court to reevaluate whether there has been
a substantial change in circumstances
since the most recent judgment and, if
there has been such a change in circumstances,
to determine whether to modify
spousal support.

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<HN02><EMB>A. The Events Preceding the Motion at
Issue</EMB>

<P20>[&para;2] The parties were married in October
1996, and Jewell filed a complaint for
divorce in February 2018. After a trial, the
court (<EM>Martin, J.</EM>) entered a divorce judgment
on March 18, 2019. It found that
Jewell, healthy at age forty-five, was a
truck driver with an earning capacity of
$80,000. He was working for a company
owned by his father and daughter. The
court found that, although he made efforts
<Page 34>
to obscure the extent of his involvement in
the business, he was the company's actual
owner and decision-maker and had received
significant income from the business.
Brewer, at age forty-six, had been a
stay-at-home parent with no job outside of
the home since 2002, and the court found
that she was fully disabled. The court
found that her earning potential was limited
because she had no formal education or
training. Based on these findings, the court
ordered Jewell to pay Brewer $2,000 per
month in spousal support "indefinitely unless
and until" Brewer either remarried or
cohabitated with another person as defined
in a now-repealed statutory provision. <EM>See</EM>
19-A M.R.S. &sect; 951-A(12) (2018), <EM>repealed
by</EM> P.L. 2019, ch. 272, &sect; 2 (effective Sept.
19, 2019).

<P20>[&para;3] After the divorce judgment was entered,
Brewer repeatedly and successfully
moved for contempt on the ground that
Jewell had failed to comply with his spousal
support obligation. Between contempt
proceedings, on January 31, 2020, Jewell
moved to modify the divorce judgment to
terminate his spousal support obligation
based on his decreased earning capacity
and Brewer's cohabitation with her boyfriend.

<P20>[&para;4] The court (<EM>Lucy, J.</EM>) entered a judgment
on June 7, 2021, denying Jewell's
motion to modify the divorce judgment
because it found that Jewell had not
proved a change in his circumstances and
was continuing to play a "shell game" with
trucking enterprises, now working for a
business owned by his girlfriend. The
court found no evidence to demonstrate a
change in Jewell's $80,000 earning capacity
as found in the divorce judgment. The
court also found that Brewer remained
disabled and that there had been no substantial
change in circumstances based on
Brewer's cohabitation because her living
arrangement had not changed since the
time of the divorce. Jewell unsuccessfully
appealed to us from the denial of his motion
to modify the judgment. <EM>Jewell v.
Jewell,</EM> Mem-22-43 (May 10, 2022).

<HN02><EMB>B. The Motion to Modify at Issue Here</EMB>

<P20>[&para;5] On December 1, 2022, Jewell filed
the motion to modify that is at issue here;
he sought a modification of the divorce
judgment to terminate his spousal support
obligation, again alleging Brewer's cohabitation.
Brewer objected to the motion.<fnr1>
The parties did not resolve the matter at
mediation.

<P20>[&para;6] The court (<EM>Szylvian, J.</EM>) held a hearing
on August 7, 2023. Jewell, Brewer, and
Jewell's wife testified. The court entered a
judgment on September 21, 2023, that included
the following findings. The company
for which Jewell was working at the
time of the divorce had gone out of business
because profits were inadequate to
sustain operations. Jewell's then girlfriend,
who has since become his wife, began operating
a new business and picked up one
of the contracts that the former business
once held. She hired Jewell as an employee
and began to pay him approximately $850
per week. After that business also ceased
operations in 2019, she began a third business,
again with Jewell as an employee.
For much of 2022, Jewell was voluntarily
underemployed, but he returned to work
for his now wife's company in November
2022, earning approximately $1,000 per
week. Jewell now has two young children
with his wife.

<P20>[&para;7] The court found that Brewer collects
a modest disability income of $4,400
per year due to diagnoses of fibromyalgia
and a back injury that cause her to experience
<Page 35>
pain if she sits or stands for a long
period of time, such that she must alternate
positions throughout the day to avoid
pain. The court found that Brewer's testimony
about her inability to work in various
types of jobs was not credible. It found
her testimony evasive when she was asked
if she had performed specific work, including
record-keeping work, for various businesses.
The court determined that she had
the capacity to work in part because she
maintained detailed records of Jewell's
payments as compared to his obligations
over the years and Jewell trusted in her
ability to keep good records. The court
also found Brewer not to be credible in
denying any awareness of what her cohabitating
partner earns as a truck driver.

<P20>[&para;8] The court found a substantial
change in circumstances based on the
births of Jewell's two minor children,
Brewer's ability to work "in a post-pandemic
labor market," and a decrease in
Jewell's income from the $80,000 imputed
to him to the $52,000 per year he is now
able to earn. The court granted Jewell's
motion to modify, eliminating the spousal
support obligation but requiring Jewell to
pay Brewer $500 per month by direct deposit
beginning on November 1, 2023, toward
his $53,200 spousal support arrearage
and $8,600 attorney fee debt.

<P20>[&para;9] Brewer did not seek additional findings
of fact or conclusions of law. <EM>See</EM> M.R.
Civ. P. 52. She timely appealed from the
court's judgment. <EM>See</EM> 19-A M.R.S. &sect; 104
(2024); 14 M.R.S. &sect; 1901(1) (2024); M.R.
App. P. 2B(c)(1).

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<P20>[&para;10] Brewer argues that the court
erred in finding a substantial change in
circumstances because the court relied in
part on events occurring and circumstances
existing before the most recent
final judgment. She contends that the evidence
properly before the court showed
that Jewell's earning capacity had not decreased
and Brewer remained disabled.

<HN02><EMB>A. Consideration of Pre-Divorce Evidence</EMB>

<P20>[&para;11] In reviewing a decision on a
post-divorce motion to modify, we review
for an abuse of discretion a decision to
admit and consider, over a party's objection,
evidence of pre-divorce facts. <EM>See
Fraser v. Boyer,</EM> 1998 ME 253, &para; 12, 722
A.2d 354. Because Brewer raised no objection
at trial, however, we review the admission
and consideration of the evidence
for obvious error. <EM>See Jusseaume v. Ducatt,</EM>
2011 ME 43, &para; 11, 15 A.3d 714; <EM>Gravison
v. Fisher,</EM> 2016 ME 35, &para; 28, 134 A.3d
857, <EM>abrogated in part on other grounds by
Dupuis v. Ellingwood,</EM> 2017 ME 132, &para; 9
n.4, 166 A.3d 112. Obvious error is "a
seriously prejudicial error tending to produce
a manifest injustice." <EM>Gravison,</EM> 2016
ME 35, &para; 28, 134 A.3d 857 (quotation
marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;12] In acting on a motion to
modify a divorce judgment, a court may
consider evidence from before the entry of
the divorce judgment in some circumstances.
<EM>See Fraser,</EM> 1998 ME 253, &para; 12,
722 A.2d 354 ("The relevance and admissibility
of ... pre-divorce evidence in post-divorce
hearings must be evaluated based
on the issues and circumstances of each
case."). For instance, when the original
divorce judgment is entered based on a
settlement agreement, to determine
whether there has been a substantial
change in circumstances a court may need
to consider the circumstances at the time
of the divorce in more detail than the
divorce judgment provides. <EM>See id.</EM> &para;&para; 9-12.
In such instances, "evidence of the parties'
pre-divorce conduct [may] serve as a contextual
basis for evaluating post-divorce
conduct." <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 11.
<Page 36>

<P20>[&para;13] Here, the court&mdash;without objection
from Brewer&mdash;admitted some evidence
of Brewer's work history from before
the entry of the divorce judgment.
The court was considering whether Brewer
remained fully disabled, as had been
found in the original divorce judgment
and the judgment denying Jewell's first
motion to modify. Some of Brewer's testimony
conflicted with the divorce court's
findings about her work for family businesses
during the marriage, which the
court could consider for purposes of assessing
Brewer's credibility. Because the
court considered evidence of facts predating
the previous divorce judgment and
judgment denying Jewell's first motion to
modify only to determine whether Brewer
was credible in testifying that she <EM>remains</EM>
unable to work, the court did not
err, much less commit obvious error, in
admitting and considering the evidence.

<HN02><EMB>B. Evidentiary Support for the Court's
Findings of Fact on Each Party's
Earning Capacity</EMB>

<P20>[&para;14] "The party seeking modification
of a spousal support award granted
in a divorce judgment bears the burden of
establishing a substantial change in circumstances
justifying a modification." <EM>Ellis
v. Ellis,</EM> 2008 ME 191, &para; 11, 962 A.2d
328 (quotation marks omitted). If a party
satisfies that burden of demonstrating a
change in circumstances, the court may
order a modification if "justice requires."
19-A M.R.S. &sect; 951-A(4) (2024); <EM>see Ellis,</EM>
2008 ME 191, &para; 11, 962 A.2d 328. Because
Brewer did not move for findings of fact,
"we must assume the trial court made all
findings necessary to support its judgment,
but only to the extent that those
findings are supported by competent record
evidence." <EM>Amero v. Amero,</EM> 2016 ME
150, &para; 6, 149 A.3d 535 (quotation marks
omitted).

<P20>[&para;15] "When considering a motion
to modify spousal support, the trial
court looks for a substantial change in the
financial circumstances of the parties <EM>since
the most recent final order,</EM> and, if it finds
a substantial change in circumstances, it
may order a modification of the support
award if justice requires. Whether a substantial
change in circumstances exists is a
factual finding that we review for clear
error." <EM>Marston v. Marston,</EM> 2016 ME 87,
&para; 7, 141 A.3d 1106 (emphasis added and
quotation marks omitted). The determination
of whether there has been a substantial
change in circumstances is "based
upon the payor's ability to pay spousal
support, including his or her earning potential
and assets, and not simply the payor's
actual earnings at the time of the
hearing." <EM>Pettinelli v. Yost,</EM> 2007 ME 121,
&para; 14, 930 A.2d 1074 (quotation marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;16] "When determining whether
there has been a substantial change in
circumstances, a trial court may not engage
in a reevaluation of the basis for the
original award of spousal support."
<EM>McLeod v. Macul,</EM> 2016 ME 76, &para; 18, 139
A.3d 920. The circumstances that existed
or were anticipated at the time of the
divorce judgment cannot be relitigated and
are accepted as found in the divorce judgment.
<EM>See id.</EM> &para;&para; 19-20; <EM>Haag v. Haag,</EM> 609
A.2d 1164, 1165 (Me. 1992).

<P20>[&para;17] For example, we held that it was
error for a court to find that the payee's
continued unemployment two years after
the entry of a divorce judgment constituted
a substantial change in circumstances
when (1) the parties had agreed to the
award of spousal support in consideration
of the unequal division of marital property
and (2) no evidence was presented at the
hearing on the motion to modify that
would demonstrate a change in the payee
spouse's employment circumstances. <EM>See</EM>
<Page 37>
<EM>McLeod,</EM> 2016 ME 76, &para;&para; 2-3, 5, 19-21, 139
A.3d 920. Similarly, we held that it was
error for a court to consider the duration
of the parties' marriage in ruling on a
motion to modify when the divorce court
already considered and ruled on the appropriateness
of the award in light of the
statutory presumptions that depend on the
duration of the marriage. <EM>See Pettinelli,</EM>
2007 ME 121, &para;&para; 16-20, 930 A.2d 1074. And
where a divorce court had declined a payor
spouse's request to include in the divorce
judgment a provision terminating spousal
support in the event of cohabitation, the
payee's cohabitation could not constitute a
substantial change in circumstances warranting
a modification. <EM>Haag,</EM> 609 A.2d at
1165.

<P20>[&para;18] Here, the court found a substantial
change in circumstances based on
its findings that Brewer was no longer
fully disabled, that Jewell had become responsible
for his two young children, and
that Jewell's earning capacity was thirty-five
percent lower than the $80,000 earning
capacity that was previously found.
Brewer is correct that, with respect to her
earning capacity, the record contains insufficient
evidence that she could find work in
the post-pandemic labor market despite
her disabilities. Although the court found
Brewer not to be credible with respect to
her current earning capacity, Jewell offered
no evidence regarding what work
was available to Brewer or what Brewer
could earn. Although he could have sought
discovery of additional information about
Brewer's disability, <EM>see</EM> M.R. Civ. P. 112,
or offered evidence regarding the availability
of work that Brewer can perform, the
record contains no such evidence. Brewer's
lack of credibility did not relieve Jewell of
the obligation to prove through evidence
that Brewer's earning capacity had
changed since June 7, 2021. <EM>See Ellis,</EM> 2008
ME 191, &para; 11, 962 A.2d 328. The court did
not expressly find that Brewer could earn
any specific dollar amount, and there is no
evidence of Brewer's capacity to work at
any of the positions suggested by the
court. We therefore are unable to infer
from the evidence findings of fact sufficient
to support the court's finding that
Jewell had satisfied his burden of proving
a change in Brewer's earning capacity. The
unsupported finding regarding Brewer's
ability to work factored into the court's
exercise of discretion in terminating spousal
support. <EM>See Durkin v. Durkin,</EM> 2019
ME 32, &para; 10, 203 A.3d 812. As a result, we
must vacate the judgment as it relates to
spousal support and remand for further
proceedings.

<HN02><EMB>C. Proceedings on Remand</EMB>

<P20>[&para;19] When there is a substantial
change in circumstances, both the payee's
need and the payor's capacity to pay
must be considered in determining spousal
support, <EM>Corcoran v. Marie,</EM> 2011 ME 14,
&para; 18, 12 A.3d 71, and this balancing must
be revisited here in light of our conclusion
that the record lacks evidence of Brewer's
capacity to work. On remand, the court
must therefore reconsider whether there
has been a substantial change in circumstances
independent of that unsupported
finding. <EM>See, e.g., Ellis,</EM> 2008 ME 191, &para; 16,
962 A.2d 328 (holding that a substantial
decrease in income, increase in debt, and
financial difficulties were sufficient to demonstrate
a substantial change in circumstances).
The court found that Jewell's responsibility
for two young children<fnr2> and
his "income maintaining at a level of approximately
<Page 38>
$52,000 per year, not the
amount previously imputed to him," constituted
a substantial change in circumstances.
The undisputed evidence was that
Jewell earned $1,000 per week&mdash;an
amount greater than the $850 per week
that he had been earning at the time of the
most recently entered judgment.<fnr3> Notwithstanding
an increase in actual income, a
court may find that evidence of actual
earnings consistently below the earning
capacity previously imputed undercuts the
continuing vitality of the imputed capacity.
Although the evidence does not support a
finding of a substantial change in circumstances
based on Brewer's earning capacity,
we do not rule out the possibility of a
finding on remand that other changes
demonstrate a substantial change in circumstances
since the previous judgment
was entered; the court could, for instance,
base such a finding on changes in Jewell's
income, earning capacity, or ability to pay.
<EM>See Marston,</EM> 2016 ME 87, &para; 7, 141 A.3d
1106.

<P20>[&para;20] Accordingly, we vacate the
judgment and remand the matter for the
court to determine whether there has been
a substantial change in circumstances and,
if there has been such a change, to exercise
its discretion in determining spousal
support based on the circumstances demonstrated
in the evidentiary record, taking
into account all pertinent factors. <EM>See</EM> 19-A
M.R.S. &sect; 951-A(5). These factors may include
Jewell's ability to pay; the employment
and income history and potential of
each party; their education and training;
their health and disabilities; Brewer's ability
to become self-supporting, which may
include consideration of the undisclosed
earnings of her boyfriend; and any other
relevant factors. <EM>See</EM> 19-A M.R.S. &sect; 951-A(5)(B),
(D)-(F), (I), (O), (Q).

<P20>The entry is:

<B22>Judgment vacated. Remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
<FN>
<fnt1> Each party also moved to enforce certain
other provisions of the divorce judgment, but
the court's rulings on those motions are not at
issue here and we do not discuss them.

<fnt2> The older of these two children was an
infant in June 2021 when the court (<EM>Lucy, J.</EM>)
entered the order denying Jewell's previous
motion to modify. The second child had not
yet been born and was only three months old
at the time of the trial on the motion at issue
here.

<fnt3> In connection with Jewell's previous motion
to modify, he testified that he was earning
$720 per week. The court (<EM>Lucy, J.</EM>) did not
find the $720 amount credible, in part because
of evidence that Jewell's wife was advertising
for an open position like Jewell's
with pay of $900 per week. Jewell testified,
for purposes of the second motion to modify,
that he had been earning $850 per week at
that time. The court (<EM>Szylvian, J.</EM>) believed
that testimony.

<P20>[&para;1] Steve L. Michaud appeals from a
decision of the Workers' Compensation
Board (WCB) Appellate Division affirming
the decision of an Administrative Law
Judge (<EM>Pelletier, ALJ</EM>) holding that interest
on Michaud's specific-loss benefits for a
work-related eye injury sustained in 2014
did not begin to accrue until 2021, when
Michaud's recovery of vision from the injury
reached maximum medical improvement
and the benefit became due. The
record conclusively establishes, however,
that there was no material improvement in
Michaud's vision after the date of injury,
and therefore the benefit became due
when the injury occurred. We therefore
vacate the Appellate Division's decision
and remand the matter for entry of a
decree ordering Michaud's employer, Caribou
Ford-Mercury, Inc.,<fnr1> to pay interest
<Page 41>
on Michaud's specific-loss benefits accruing
from the date of his injury.

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<P20>[&para;2] The following facts, which are
drawn from the procedural record, the
ALJ's findings, and the parties' agreed-to
statement of facts, are supported by the
record. <EM>See</EM> 39-A M.R.S. &sect; 318 (2024); <EM>Huff
v. Reg'l Transp. Program,</EM> 2017 ME 229,
&para; 2, 175 A.3d 98.

<P20>[&para;3] On December 26, 2014, Michaud
sustained a traumatic injury to his left eye
while working as an auto mechanic. The
injury immediately resulted in a loss of
more than eighty percent of vision in that
eye. Between the date of the injury and
September 8, 2019, Caribou intermittently
paid incapacity benefits to Michaud. During
that same period, Michaud received
regular treatment, including multiple surgeries,
for his injury with the goal of improving
his vision. The surgeries included
removal of a vitreous hemorrhage on February
18, 2015, an intra-ocular lens implant
and a corneal transplant on August 24,
2015, and a second corneal transplant on
August 12, 2019, after the first proved
ineffective.

<P20>[&para;4] In September 2021, Michaud filed
petitions for an award of compensation and
for specific-loss benefits.<fnr2> Shortly thereafter,
on October 14, 2021, a doctor issued a
report stating that the doctor had reviewed
Michaud's medical records and Michaud
"seem[ed] to be at a point of maximum
medical improvement."<fnr3> The doctor's
report summarized Michaud's treatment
history, including various reported improvements
in his sight in his left eye over
the course of treatment, and concluded
that Michaud had suffered, as of the date
of the report, a ninety-four percent loss of
vision in his left eye.

<P20>[&para;5] On March 10, 2022, the parties participated
in mediation on Michaud's petitions,
resulting in a partial agreement that
Michaud is entitled to 162 weeks of specific-loss
benefits for the loss of more than
eighty percent of vision in his left eye. <EM>See</EM>
39-A M.R.S. &sect; 212(3)(M) (2024). The parties
further agreed that Caribou would
receive a credit for the intermittent payments
that it had voluntarily made to Michaud
between the date of his injury and
September 8, 2019. The agreed-upon benefit
amount was $59,905.33, which Caribou
paid to Michaud on March 22, 2022.

<P20>[&para;6] Mediation did not resolve, however,
the issue of when Michaud became entitled
to specific-loss benefits or, by extension,
the amount of interest owed on Michaud's
specific-loss benefits. <EM>See</EM> 39-A M.R.S.
&sect; 205(6) (2024). The parties therefore referred
Michaud's petition for specific-loss
benefits to an ALJ to determine the interest
due on the award. <EM>See</EM> 39-A M.R.S.
&sect; 315 (2024). In lieu of a hearing, the
parties stipulated facts to the ALJ, <EM>see id.</EM>
&sect; 318, establishing, inter alia, that Michaud
"sustained more than [eighty percent] vision
loss at the time of his initial injury"
and that the doctor's October 14, 2021,
<Page 42>
report determining that Michaud's final
vision loss was ninety-four percent was
"the first time there was an assessment of
a numerical percentage of vision loss with
respect to the injury."

<P20>[&para;7] On December 1, 2022, the ALJ entered
a decree stating that "[u]ntil surgical
intervention aimed at restoring vision had
occurred and progress could be assessed,
the degree of permanent loss could not be
determined." Because the doctor reported
on October 14, 2021, that Michaud had
reached MMI, the ALJ concluded that Michaud's
specific-loss benefits became due
on that date. Interest was therefore owed
on the award from that date to the date
that the benefits were paid, March 22,
2022. <EM>See id.</EM> &sect; 205(6). Michaud moved for
further findings of fact and conclusions of
law, <EM>id.</EM> &sect; 318, arguing that his actual loss
of eighty percent of the vision in his left
eye occurred on the date of his injury and
interest was therefore owed as of that
date. The ALJ denied the motion.

<P20>[&para;8] Michaud then appealed the ALJ's
decree to the Appellate Division, <EM>see</EM> 39-A
M.R.S. &sect; 321-B (2024), arguing that the
ALJ erred by concluding that, although
Michaud's injury immediately resulted in
more than eighty percent vision loss in his
left eye and medical intervention had been
unsuccessful, Michaud's specific-loss benefits
became due only after his doctor reported
that he had reached MMI. Relying
on our decision in <EM>Tracy v. Hershey
Creamery Co.,</EM> 1998 ME 247, 720 A.2d 579,
the only case in which we have dealt with a
claim for specific-loss benefits arising from
a work-related eye injury, the Appellate
Division (<EM>Chabot, ALJ</EM>) affirmed the ALJ's
decree. Michaud petitioned for review, and
on December 8, 2023, we granted his petition.
<EM>See</EM> 39-A M.R.S. &sect; 322(1), (3) (2024);
M.R. App. P. 23.

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<P20>[&para;9] Michaud makes two arguments as
to why the Appellate Division erred by
affirming the ALJ's decree. First, he contends
that his specific-loss benefits became
due not on the date that his doctor reported
that he had reached MMI and had
sustained a post-treatment vision loss of
ninety-four percent, but on the date of his
injury. He argues that although, pursuant
to our decision in <EM>Tracy,</EM> the determination
of whether an employee qualifies for specific-loss
benefits for loss of an eye<fnr4> cannot
be made until the injury has reached
its reasonable medical endpoint, when the
employee's vision loss remains above the
eighty percent loss threshold from the
time of injury, the benefit is due on the
date of the injury. Caribou argues that
<EM>Tracy</EM> dictates that specific-loss benefits
for the loss of an eye are not due until an
employee's eye injury has reached its reasonable
medical endpoint, the employer receives
notice that the injury is at its endpoint,
and the employee's vision loss at
that point exceeds the statutory eighty
percent loss threshold.

<P20>[&para;10] Second, Michaud argues that the
Appellate Division could not affirm the
ALJ's decree because the ALJ effectively
allowed Caribou to credit its voluntary incapacity
payments made before Michaud
was entitled to specific-loss benefits pursuant
to the decree, despite a prohibition on
offsets from specific-loss benefits for payments
made before specific-loss benefits
become due.

<P20>[&para;11] For the reasons explained below,
we agree with Michaud that his specific-loss
<Page 43>
benefits became due on the date of his
injury, December 26, 2014, and note that
the settlement agreement governed whether
Caribou was entitled to offset the award
of specific-loss benefits with the voluntary
incapacity benefits it had paid to Michaud.

<HN02><EMB>A. Standard of Review and Statutory
Framework</EMB>

<P20>[&para;12] We review decisions of the
Appellate Division "according to established
principles of administrative law, except
with regard to the ... ALJ's factual
findings," <EM>Bailey v. City of Lewiston,</EM> 2017
ME 160, &para; 9, 168 A.3d 762, which are final
in the absence of fraud, 39-A M.R.S. &sect; 318.
We "afford appropriate deference to the
Appellate Division's reasonable interpretation
of the workers' compensation statute
and will uphold the Appellate Division's
interpretation unless the plain language of
the statute and its legislative history compel
a contrary result." <EM>Bailey,</EM> 2017 ME
160, &para; 9, 168 A.3d 762 (citation and quotation
marks omitted). In interpreting the
Workers' Compensation Act, we "look to
the plain meaning of the statutory language,
and construe that language to avoid
absurd, illogical, or inconsistent results."
<EM>Freeman v. NewPage Corp.,</EM> 2016 ME 45,
&para; 5, 135 A.3d 340 (quotation marks omitted).
The Act must be construed neutrally
so as not to favor either the employee or
the employer. <EM>Marsella v. Bath Iron
Works Corp.,</EM> 585 A.2d 802, 804 & n.5 (Me.
1991); <EM>see also</EM> 39-A M.R.S. &sect; 153(3) (2024).

<P20>[&para;13] Although we afford appropriate
deference to the Appellate Division's
reasonable interpretation of the workers'
compensation statute, when the ultimate
issue is the proper interpretation of judicial
precedent, we are not obligated to
defer to the Appellate Division's interpretation
of that precedent. <EM>See NLRB. v.
U.S. Postal Serv.,</EM> 660 F.3d 65, 68 (1st Cir.
2011) (explaining that an appellate court is
not compelled to defer to an agency's interpretation
of judicial precedent); <EM>cf. Van
Houten v. Harco Const., Inc.,</EM> 655 A.2d
331, 333 (Me. 1995) (reviewing de novo
WCB's determination that a party was not
collaterally estopped from raising an issue
because the question of collateral estoppel
did not "involve an interpretation of the
[Workers' Compensation] Act" or "fall
within the [WCB's] traditional area of expertise").
Accordingly, we interpret judicial
precedent de novo. <EM>See Me. Pub. Serv.
Co. v. Fed. Power Comm'n,</EM> 579 F.2d 659,
665 (1st Cir. 1978) (stating that a court
"may pass judgment independently" of an
agency's interpretation of judicial precedent);
<EM>cf. Bates v. Dep't of Behav. & Developmental
Servs.,</EM> 2004 ME 154, &para; 38, 863
A.2d 890 ("The trial court's interpretation
of its own judgment will be reviewed de
novo on questions of law....").

<P20>[&para;14] Specific-loss benefits are a species
of total-incapacity benefits that compensate
injured employees for "actual loss" of
a body part. 39-A M.R.S. &sect; 212(3). For
specific losses, "the incapacity is considered
to continue for the period specified"
in the statutory schedule of benefits. <EM>Id.</EM>
Specific-loss benefits are available for an
employee who suffers "total loss" of an
eye, which is defined as an "[e]ighty percent
loss of vision of one eye." <EM>Id.</EM>
&sect; 212(3)(M). Under the statutory schedule,
an employee who has lost at least eighty
percent vision in one eye due to a workplace
injury is entitled to 162 weeks of
compensation. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>[&para;15] For most injuries included in the
schedule, "actual loss" has been construed
as "amputation" of the body part. <EM>E.g.,
Gibbs v. Fraser Paper, Ltd.,</EM> 1997 ME 225,
&para;&para; 6-7, 703 A.2d 1256 (distinguishing between
"physical loss" and "loss of function"
of a finger and concluding that section
212(3) generally requires amputation of
the member); <EM>see also</EM> 39-A M.R.S.
<Page 44>
&sect; 212(3)(A)-(L). Thus, in <EM>Scott v. Fraser
Papers, Inc.,</EM> 2013 ME 32, &para;&para; 11, 13, 65
A.3d 1191, we explained that an employee
who suffered a work-related injury to his
hand was not entitled to specific-loss benefits
for loss of a finger until several months
after the injury, when his condition had
deteriorated and his finger had to be amputated.

<P20>[&para;16] Because the loss of an eye is defined
by statute as the loss of a certain
percentage of vision in the eye, as opposed
to the "physical loss" of the eye, it is more
difficult to assess whether an employee has
suffered an eye injury that qualifies for
specific-loss benefits than to assess whether
injuries to other body parts entitle an
employee to specific-loss benefits. We have
addressed specific-loss benefits in regard
to an injury of an eye only once, in <EM>Tracy.</EM>
Whether that decision prescribes the out-come
of Michaud's appeal is the central
issue before us.

<HN02><EMB>B. Applicability of</EMB> <EMBI>Tracy v. Hershey
Creamery Co.</EMBI>

<P20>[&para;17] In <EM>Tracy,</EM> we held that "the determination
as to whether an employee's loss
of vision exceeds [eighty percent] for purposes
of [section] 212(3)(M) should be
made when the work-related condition has
reached a reasonable medical endpoint."
1998 ME 247, &para; 9, 720 A.2d 579. In reaching
this conclusion, we recognized that specific-loss
benefits, under the former Workers'
Compensation Act,<fnr5> were "intended as
compensation for permanent impairment"
and that the determination of permanent
vision loss "was made at the point of maximum
medical improvement." <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 8 (quotation
marks omitted). We observed that
even though the current section 212(3),
governing specific-loss benefits, contains
no reference to MMI, it does contain "similar
concepts" to permanent-impairment
benefits&mdash;which are determined by reference
to MMI&mdash;"expressed by use of the
term[] ... `actual loss.'" <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 9. We
grafted the MMI concept onto the specific-loss
provision for loss of an eye for the
limited purpose of ensuring that specific-loss
benefits were not awarded to employees
whose vision loss was merely temporary
and could be restored to a point
below the statutory threshold through reasonable
medical intervention. <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 12
(recognizing that permitting compensation
for specific-loss benefits for only temporary
injuries "would be directly contrary
to the Legislature's intent to allow specific-loss
benefits only in instances of a total,
catastrophic loss").

<P20>[&para;18] Avoiding the award of specific-loss
benefits when an employee's vision loss
can be restored to a point below the statutory
threshold by reasonable medical intervention
comports with the Workers'
Compensation Act. Were we to overrule
<EM>Tracy</EM>'s requirement that the determination
of whether an employee qualifies for
specific-loss benefits be made only after
medical efforts to restore vision, we would
necessarily disregard the legislative mandate
to construe the Workers' Compensation
Act neutrally. 39-A M.R.S. &sect; 153(3).
We also would, effectively, open the door
to awarding the specific-loss benefit to any
employee who suffers an eye injury that
causes an immediate eighty percent vision
loss, even if medical intervention could restore
the employee's vision loss to a point
below that statutory benefit threshold.
This would impermissibly favor employees,
place a burden on employers to compensate
injuries that do not amount to the
"total loss" of an eye, and conflict with the
<Page 45>
statutory language of section 212(3)(M)
that loss of an eye is considered to continue
for 162 weeks. <EM>See id.</EM> &sect;&sect; 153(3),
212(3)(M); <EM>Freeman,</EM> 2016 ME 45, &para; 5, 135
A.3d 340.

<P20>[&para;19] Thus, the determination of
whether Michaud qualified for specific-loss
benefits could be made only after his eye
injury had reached its reasonable medical
endpoint. Because his doctor did not determine
that he had reached MMI until October
14, 2021,<fnr6> his entitlement to specific-loss
benefits could not be decided until
that date.

<P20>[&para;20] Contrary to the Appellate Division's
conclusion, <EM>Tracy</EM> is not dispositive
here. In <EM>Tracy,</EM> the employee's vision was
significantly restored through medical intervention
such that at the eye injury's
reasonable medical endpoint, the employee
had only a sixty to seventy percent vision
loss. 1998 ME 247, &para; 2, 720 A.2d 579.
Therefore, the employee in <EM>Tracy</EM> did not
qualify for specific-loss benefits. <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 12.
By contrast, Michaud's injury immediately
resulted in more than eighty percent loss
of vision in his left eye, but as of the
injury's reasonable medical endpoint, he
had a ninety-four percent vision loss in his
left eye&mdash;well above the threshold for specific-loss
benefits. <EM>Tracy</EM> does not address
when specific-loss benefits become due under
these circumstances.

<HN02><EMB>C. When Michaud's Benefits Became
Due</EMB>

<P20>[&para;21] The date that an employee's specific-loss
benefits become due for loss of an
eye, and from which interest accrues, when
reasonable medical treatment does not adequately
restore vision is an issue of first
impression. Under the Workers' Compensation
Act, "[w]hen weekly compensation is
paid pursuant to an award, interest on the
compensation must be paid at the rate of
10% per annum from the date each payment
was due, until paid." 39-A M.R.S.
&sect; 205(6); <EM>see also Guiggey v. Great N.
Paper, Inc.,</EM> 1997 ME 232, &para; 10, 704 A.2d
375. Specific-loss benefits are "due and
payable within 14 days after the employer
has notice or knowledge of the injury." 39-A
M.R.S. &sect; 205(2). An "injury" for specific
<Page 46>
loss of an eye is one that results in "total
loss" of the eye, which is defined as an
eighty percent loss of vision in that eye.
39-A M.R.S. &sect; 212(3)(M).

<P20>[&para;22] Although, pursuant to
<EM>Tracy,</EM> an eye injury must undergo reasonable
medical treatment before it can be
determined whether an employee qualifies
at all for specific-loss benefits, it does not
follow that the date that the reasonable
medical endpoint is confirmed is the date
that benefits become due, as the ALJ (<EM>Pelletier,
ALJ</EM>) concluded here. That date has
no bearing on when the employee in fact
suffered an injury constituting the actual
loss of an eye. <EM>See Bailey,</EM> 2017 ME 160,
&para; 9, 168 A.3d 762 (recognizing arbitrary
decision-making as a basis for rejecting a
decision of the WCB). Rather, when an
employee's vision at the reasonable medical
endpoint still exceeds the statutory loss
threshold, the date that specific-loss benefits
became due is retrospective, potentially
to the date of injury. Evaluators must
look backward to determine when the eye
injury damaged the employee's vision to
the threshold of eighty percent vision loss,
whether treatment later restored the employee's
vision, and the extent of any restoration.

<P20>[&para;23] Michaud's injury occurred
on December 26, 2014. Caribou was aware
of his injury on that date and began paying
Michaud incapacity benefits effective the
following day. There is no dispute that the
injury immediately resulted in more than
eighty percent vision loss in Michaud's left
eye. There is also no dispute that extensive
surgical intervention failed to restore his
vision, and, at the reasonable medical endpoint
of his treatment, Michaud's condition
had further deteriorated to a ninety-four
percent vision loss. Although Michaud reported,
and visual acuity tests reflected,
improvements in his vision at various times
during his treatment, nothing in the record
suggests that his vision loss was restored
to a point below the threshold of an eighty
percent vision loss or could reasonably
have been anticipated to do so. Nor does
the record contain any documented assessment
or estimate of a numerical percentage
of Michaud's vision loss during his
treatment. Considering these facts, and
looking backward from the reasonable
medical endpoint, Michaud suffered actual
loss of his left eye on the date of his injury,
December 26, 2014, and there was never
an assessment that his vision loss was
restored to a point below the eighty percent
threshold after that. Thus, Michaud
became entitled to specific-loss benefits on
the date of his injury, and Caribou owes
interest on the award of specific-loss benefits
accruing from that date until March
22, 2022, when Caribou paid the benefit.
<EM>See</EM> 39-A M.R.S. &sect;&sect; 205(2), (6), 212(3)(M).

<P20>[&para;24] Caribou contends that this conclusion
is untenable because, until the doctor's
report on October 14, 2021, it lacked
notice that Michaud's injury gave rise to
an obligation to pay specific-loss benefits.
It cites our decision in <EM>Carroll v. Gates
Formed Fibre Prods.,</EM> 663 A.2d 23, 25 (Me.
1995), to support this argument. In that
case, we held that "although the employee
may not be required to give affirmative
notice of a claim in all cases, the employer
must have some knowledge, either from
the employee or from the circumstances of
the injury, that it has an obligation to pay
incapacity benefits before it will be
deemed to have accepted an injury by
failing to controvert a claim." <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>[&para;25] That decision is inapposite. The
issue in the present case is not, as it was in
<EM>Carroll,</EM> whether Caribou has an obligation
to pay even though it lacked notice that
Michaud's petition for benefits resulted
from a workplace injury. <EM>Id.</EM> at 24. Caribou
unquestionably had notice that Michaud
suffered a work-related injury and that the
<Page 47>
injury may be compensable, as evidenced
by the fact that it began voluntarily paying
benefits shortly after that. Moreover, we
have made clear that "[a]wareness of the
compensable nature of the injury ... [is]
required only with respect to triggering
the notice and limitations period, and not
to set a date of injury." <EM>Jensen v. S.D.
Warren Co.,</EM> 2009 ME 35, &para; 26, 968 A.2d
528; <EM>see also</EM> 39-A M.R.S. &sect; 302 (2024)
("Want of notice is not a bar to proceedings
under this Act if it is shown that the
employer ... had knowledge of the injury.").

<P20>[&para;26] Our distinction between the date
on which an employee's entitlement to specific-loss
benefits for loss of an eye may be
determined and the date on which the
benefits became due reflects the Legislature's
mandate that the workers' compensation
statute be construed neutrally "so
as to ensure the efficient delivery of compensation
to injured employees at a reasonable
cost to employers." 39-A M.R.S.
&sect; 153(3). Because eligibility for specific-loss
benefits cannot be determined until an
employee has undergone reasonable medical
treatment, employees will seek care
that may restore their vision, thereby eliminating
any likelihood that employers will
pay benefits to employees who suffered
only temporary vision loss. <EM>See Tracy,</EM> 1998
ME 247, &para; 12, 720 A.2d 579. At the same
time, by compensating employees for the
full period that they have suffered vision
loss above the statutory threshold, this
rule recognizes the "human factors ...
attendant with the traumatic loss of a body
part or vision resulting from a work-related
injury," <EM>id.</EM> &para; 7 (quotation marks omitted);
<EM>see also</EM> 39-A M.R.S. &sect; 221 (2024), and
the minimal costs to the workers' compensation
system imposed by these injuries,
<EM>see</EM> Richard B. Dalbeck et al., <EM>Report of
Blue Ribbon Commission to Examine Alternatives
to the Workers' Compensation
System and to Make Recommendations
Concerning Replacement of the Present
System</EM> (Aug. 31, 1992), https://lldc.mainelegislature.org/Open/Rpts/kf3615_z99m243_1992_v1.pdf
[https://perma.cc/VRS8-C9K4]
(noting that scheduled impairment
benefits, from which specific-loss benefits
derive, are available for injuries that make
up only a "small percentage" of workers'
compensation claims). Similarly, although
employers will be required to pay interest
on specific-loss benefits for traumatic eye
injuries dating as far back as the date of
injury, that requirement is consistent with
the purposes of interest on workers' compensation
awards to compensate the employee
for delay in payment and to discourage
employers from contesting valid
claims. <EM>Guiggey,</EM> 1997 ME 232, &para; 7, 704
A.2d 375.

<P20>[&para;27] The Appellate Division affirmed
a decree that is inconsistent with
the plain language of the Workers' Compensation
Act and legislative intent. Based
on a misconception of our precedent, it
used an arbitrary date to calculate the
interest owed on Michaud's specific-loss
benefits. <EM>See Bailey,</EM> 2017 ME 160, &para; 9, 168
A.3d 762. We therefore vacate its decision.
Under the facts stipulated to by the parties,
Michaud's award became due on the
date of his injury, and Caribou owes interest
on the award accruing from that date.<fnr7>

<P20>The entry is:

<B22>Judgment vacated. Remanded to the

Compensation Trust.

<fnt2> Pursuant to 39 M.R.S. &sect; 213, "specific loss
benefits" arise from work-related injuries that
cause the actual loss of certain body parts or
bodily functions, for which the injured employee
is deemed to be incapacitated for the
period listed in the schedule contained in
section 213(3) and due compensation based
on a calculation from the date of injury, subject
to the maximum benefit set in section
211.

<fnt3> "Maximum medical improvement (MMI)" is
"the date after which further recovery and
further restoration of function can no longer
be reasonably anticipated, based upon reasonable
medical probability." 39-A M.R.S.
&sect; 102(15) (2024). An injured employee must
reach MMI before he can receive partial incapacity
benefits, <EM>id.</EM> &sect; 102(16); 39-A M.R.S.
&sect; 213 (2024), which are not at issue in this
case.

<fnt4> For the purposes of the specific-loss benefits
provision of the Worker's Compensation Act,
an eighty present loss of vision in one eye
constitutes the loss of that eye. 39-A M.R.S.
&sect; 212(3)(M) (2024)

<fnt5> The Workers' Compensation Act was repealed
and replaced in its entirety in 1992.
P.L. 1991, ch. 885, &sect;&sect; A-7, -8, -11 (effective
Jan. 1, 1993) (codified as amended at 39-A
M.R.S. &sect;&sect; 101-909 (2024)).

<fnt6> For purposes of this appeal, we consider the
doctor's report that Michaud had reached
MMI as of the date of the report as a determination
that his injury was at a reasonable
medical endpoint as of the same date. In
other cases, however, those dates may not be
the same. MMI "is a prediction that an employee's
condition will not improve."
<EM>Williams v. E.S. Boulos Co.,</EM> 2000 ME 40, &para; 9,
747 A.2d 181. It is essential to the calculation
of partial incapacity benefits because it signifies
the date on which an employee's ongoing
impairment is permanent, rather than temporary.
<EM>See</EM> 39-A M.R.S. &sect; 102(16) (defining
"permanent impairment" as "any anatomic
or functional abnormality or loss existing after
the date of [MMI] that results from the
injury"); <EM>id.</EM> &sect; 213; <EM>Bailey v. City of Lewiston,</EM>
2017 ME 160, &para; 15, 168 A.3d 762.

<P20>In the specific-loss-benefit context, MMI
has limited significance, because specific-loss
benefits do not depend on whether the employee's
loss of vision will be restored <EM>at all,</EM>
but whether the employee's vision will be
restored <EM>to a point below an eighty percent
loss.</EM> 39-A M.R.S. &sect; 212(3)(M) (2024). So, although
an eye injury will always have reached
its reasonable medical endpoint if it has also
reached MMI, the converse is not necessarily
true. Rather, the reasonable medical endpoint
for the specific loss of an eye is the time at
which an eye injury can no longer reasonably
be anticipated to improve to less than an
eighty percent loss. That may occur before
MMI if, for instance, the employee immediately
loses ninety-five percent of his vision
and treatment can reasonably be anticipated
to restore vision to a ninety percent loss but
not to a seventy-nine percent loss. As the
WCB has noted, <EM>Tracy</EM> recognized overlap in
the concepts of MMI and entitlement to specific-loss
benefits, but it does not require an
employee to prove he has reached MMI to

<P20>[&para;1] Michael J. Nelligan appeals from a
Superior Court (York County, <EM>Mulhern,
J.</EM>) judgment upholding the Town of Parsonsfield
Planning Board's approval of a
permit authorizing Roger K. Moreau to
operate an automotive repair shop on a lot
abutting property owned by Nelligan. On
Moreau's appeal brought pursuant to M.R.
Civ. P. 80B, the court vacated a decision of
the Town Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA)
setting aside the Planning Board's approval
of Moreau's permit. We agree with Nelligan
that the Planning Board erred in
approving Moreau's permit because the access
road that links Moreau's lot to a
public road does not conform to the requirements
of the Town's Land Use and
Development Ordinance for a private access
road that serves a business. We therefore
vacate the Superior Court's judgment
and direct the entry of a judgment in favor
of Nelligan and the Town of Parsonsfield.

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<P20>[&para;2] The following facts are drawn from
the administrative record and the court's
findings, which are supported by the record.
<EM>See Fair Elections Portland, Inc. v.
City of Portland,</EM> 2021 ME 32, &para; 11, 252
A.3d 504; <EM>Raposa v. Town of York,</EM> 2020
ME 72, &para; 2, 234 A.3d 206.

<P20>[&para;3] Moreau owns a lot on Reed Lane in
the Town of Parsonsfield. The lot was created
through the division of a larger parcel
and has no frontage on any public road or
street. Reed Lane is a private road off
Maplewood Road, which is a public road.
The parties agree that Reed Lane dates to
1991 and serves multiple residences, including
the one owned by Moreau. Reed
Lane has a right-of-way that is fifty feet
wide but contains a constructed gravel
road that is only fifteen feet wide. Moreau
owns the fee interest in the right-of-way
and in a lot on Maplewood Road that lies
between Maplewood Road and Moreau's
Reed Lane lot. Since sometime between
2015 and 2018, Moreau has operated an
automotive repair business in a garage on
the Reed Lane lot without a required permit.
Nelligan, who owns property on Maplewood
Road that abuts Moreau's Reed
Lane lot, opposes Moreau's use of the lot
to operate his business.

<P20>[&para;4] Moreau's Reed Lane lot is in the
Town's Village Residential District, defined
in the Town's Land Use and Development
Ordinance as being established "to
provide for residential growth and commercial
uses appropriate for a village
area." Parsonsfield, Me., Land Use and
Development Ordinance art. II, &sect; 1(B)
(Sept. 8, 2018). In keeping with this purpose,
the ordinance permits specified
"commercial" uses on property in the Village
Residential District, including "Auto,
Rec. Vehicle, Small Engine Repair Shop."
<Page 51>
<EM>See id.</EM> &sect; 4. To operate such a repair shop
in the Village Residential District, an applicant
must obtain a site plan review permit
from the Town's Planning Board. <EM>Id.</EM>
art. II, &sect; 4 tbl. 1, art. III, &sect; 2. The Planning
Board may grant such a permit only
if the applicant satisfies seventeen site review
criteria listed in the ordinance.<fnr1> <EM>Id.</EM>
art. III, &sect; 6.

<HN00><EMB>A. Moreau's First Two Applications</EMB>

<P20>[&para;5] On June 26, 2019, Moreau submitted
to the Planning Board an application
for a site plan review, seeking after-the-fact
approval of the automotive repair
shop. On January 13, 2020, the Planning
Board denied Moreau's application.

<P20>[&para;6] After acquiring the Maplewood
Road lot that lies between Maplewood
Road and the Reed Lane lot, Moreau submitted
a second, amended application and
contended that his acquisition of the Maplewood
Road lot meant that his Reed
Lane lot had frontage on Maplewood Road
and hence conformed with the ordinance.
The Planning Board unanimously approved
the application on September 15,
2020. On October 15, 2020, Nelligan appealed
the approval to the ZBA.

<P20>[&para;7] In January 2021, the ZBA vacated
the Planning Board's decision, concluding
that the Reed Lane lot remained nonconforming
because it did not acquire public
road frontage through Moreau's acquisition
of his Maplewood Road lot. Moreau
did not appeal the ZBA's decision.

<HN00><EMB>B. Moreau's Third Application</EMB>

<P20>[&para;8] On February 22, 2021, Moreau submitted
to the Planning Board a third application
for site plan review for approval of
the automotive repair shop at the existing
garage with access via a fifty-foot-wide
right-of-way over Reed Lane. While the
application was pending, he amended it to
clarify that the garage had one bay and
would be accompanied by a separate parking
area with five parking spaces. On July
27, 2021, the Planning Board granted Moreau
a permit, and on August 19, 2021,
Nelligan appealed the decision to the ZBA
on multiple grounds, including that for
Moreau to use the lot for commercial purposes,
he had to have access to the property
via a sixty-foot-wide right-of-way that
complied with the ordinance's commercial
road standards. Meanwhile, after learning
that the existing garage was closer to a
well than the ordinance permitted, Moreau
built a two-bay garage for his business in a
different location on the Reed Lane lot.

<P20>[&para;9] After taking up Nelligan's appeal,
the ZBA issued a decision on October 4,
2021, stating that it voted unanimously to
"send the matter back to the Planning
Board for further findings" because Moreau
needed to update the site plan to
reflect his new two-bay garage, and the
Planning Board needed "to further review
the Ordinances to determine if the 50'
right-of-way is sufficient or if [a] 60' right-of-way
is needed for a new commercial use
in the [Village Residential District]." Nelligan
appealed the decision to the Superior
Court, but on February 9, 2022, the Superior
Court (<EM>Douglas, J.</EM>) dismissed the appeal,
concluding that Nelligan had failed to
exhaust his administrative remedies.
<Page 52>

<P20>[&para;10] On February 14, 2022, Moreau
submitted to the Planning Board a revised
site plan depicting the two-bay garage,
with an updated survey plan depicting a
total of ten parking spaces. On March 23,
2022, the Planning Board reviewed the
ZBA's October 2021 decision and approved
Moreau's revised site plan by a vote of
three to zero. The Planning Board found
that the existing fifty-foot right-of-way was
sufficient notwithstanding Moreau's commercial
use and that the ordinance's road
standards applied to new roads within subdivisions,
not to existing private ways such
as Reed Lane. The Planning Board's written
decision contained no additional findings
and said that the Planning Board
stood by its July 27, 2021, decision.

<P20>[&para;11] On April 14, 2022, Nelligan
appealed the Planning Board's March 2022
decision to the ZBA, and on June 23, 2022,
and July 28, 2022, the ZBA held meetings
on the appeal. Nelligan raised numerous
objections to the Planning Board's approval
of Moreau's third application, as amended.
At its meeting on June 23, 2022, the
ZBA voted to vacate the Planning Board's
decision as to one of the issues raised by
Nelligan: the necessary width of Reed
Lane. The meeting adjourned before the
ZBA had addressed Nelligan's remaining
issues and was "rescheduled" to July 28.
At the July 28 meeting, the ZBA voted, by
a vote of three to zero, to vacate the
Planning Board's approval of Moreau's site
plan review permit for three reasons, including
that, because Moreau proposed a
commercial use on his lot, the fifty-foot-wide
Reed Lane right-of-way was insufficient,
and Moreau needed access to his
Reed Lane lot via a sixty-foot-wide right-of-way
to comply with the ordinance's commercial
road standards. The ZBA's other
reasons are not at issue in this appeal.<fnr2>

<P20>[&para;12] In its July 28, 2022, decision, the
ZBA indicated that it would not reach
Nelligan's other objections because they
were "in the nature of enforcement issues,
and therefore beyond the scope of the
Appeal." On August 2, 2022, Moreau submitted
a request for reconsideration, and
on August 5, 2022, the ZBA denied it.
<Page 53>

<P20>[&para;13] On August 11, 2022, Moreau filed a
Rule 80B complaint with the Superior
Court, <EM>see</EM> M.R. Civ. P. 80B, naming the
Town and Nelligan as defendants and requesting
that the court vacate the ZBA's
decision and reinstate the Planning
Board's approval. With his complaint, Moreau
filed a motion for enlargement of the
Rule 80B deadline for filing the appeal. <EM>See</EM>
M.R. Civ. P. 80B(b). Nelligan opposed
Moreau's motion for enlargement of time.

<P20>[&para;14] The court (<EM>Mulhern, J.</EM>) granted
Moreau's motion for enlargement of time.
The court found that Moreau's appeal was
untimely but that Moreau established good
cause by showing that the ZBA had not
completed its deliberations until July 28,
2022. Additionally, the court noted that the
ZBA had acknowledged in its August 5,
2022, letter denying Moreau's motion for
reconsideration that the motion was timely.

<P20>[&para;15] Moreau filed a request that the
Rule 80B appeal record include material
from his first two applications as well as
from his third application. Nelligan opposed
Moreau's request, stating that the
record should include only what the Planning
Board considered when it made its
decision on the third application. The court
granted Moreau's request.

<P20>[&para;16] The court reviewed the March 23,
2022, Planning Board decision (which
adopted the Planning Board's prior July
2021 decision) and vacated the ZBA's decision.
The court concluded that the fifty-foot-wide
Reed Lane right-of-way complied
with the ordinance because the ordinance's
road standards did not apply to
Reed Lane, and that Moreau's proposed
use conformed to the ordinance. Responding
to Nelligan's argument that the Planning
Board failed to make findings sufficient
to support its decision, the court
acknowledged that the Planning Board's
"summary determination is insufficient"
but concluded that it could infer from the
record "the subsidiary facts supporting the
Board's conclusion that Moreau's project
complied" with the ordinance.

<P20>[&para;17] The court entered a judgment vacating
the ZBA's decision. Nelligan timely
appealed. <EM>See</EM> M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(1); 14
M.R.S. &sect; 1851 (2024).

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<P20>[&para;18] Nelligan argues that Moreau's
Rule 80B complaint was untimely filed,
that Moreau's proposed use does not conform
to the ordinance for several reasons,
and that the Planning Board did not make
findings adequate for judicial review.<fnr3> The
Town joins in Nelligan's procedural arguments
and his arguments that Moreau's
proposed use does not conform to the ordinance.
We first address the timeliness of
Moreau's Rule 80B appeal and then turn
to the substantive issues regarding whether
Moreau was entitled to the site plan
review permit under the ordinance.

<HN02><EMB>A. Timeliness of Moreau's Rule 80B
Complaint</EMB>

<P20>[&para;19] Under Rule 80B and the statute
setting the deadline for appeals from
decisions of municipal boards of appeals,
Moreau's Rule 80B complaint had to be
filed within forty-five days of the ZBA's
vote on its decision. M.R. Civ. P. 80B(b)
("The time within which review may be
sought shall be as provided by statute....");
<Page 54>
30-A M.R.S. &sect; 2691(3)(G) (2024)
("Any party may take an appeal[] within
45 days of the date of the vote on the
original decision...."). Moreover, the municipal
appeals statute provides: "Notice of
any decision must be mailed or hand delivered
to the petitioner, the petitioner's representative
or agent, the planning board,
agency or office and the municipal officers
within 7 days of the board's decision." 30-A
M.R.S. &sect; 2691(3)(E). The forty-five-day
deadline explicitly runs from the date of
the ZBA vote that decides an appeal rather
than from the date of the written notice
of the decision.

<P20>[&para;20] Moreau filed his Rule 80B complaint
on August 11, 2022, within forty-five
days of the ZBA's July 28, 2022, meeting
but more than forty-five days after the
ZBA's June 23, 2022, meeting. If the
ZBA's "vote on the original decision" occurred
at the earlier meeting, Moreau's
Rule 80B complaint was untimely filed. 30-A
M.R.S. &sect; 2691(3)(G).

<P20>[&para;21] In <EM>Beckford v. Town of Clifton,</EM> we
interpreted section 2691 to provide that
the appeal period from a ZBA decision
begins to run from the ZBA vote on all
issues raised in an appeal. 2014 ME 156,
&para;&para; 17-23, 107 A.3d 1124. In <EM>Beckford,</EM> the
board of appeals at its meeting on January
25, 2012, voted to deny the Beckfords'
appeal "in its entirety" and scheduled a
meeting for January 30, 2012, "for the
Final Decision." <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 3 (quotation marks
omitted). On January 30, 2012, the board
of appeals adopted and issued a written
decision that reflected its prior vote. <EM>Id.</EM>
&para; 4. The Beckfords filed their Rule 80B
complaint in the Superior Court within
forty-five days after the January 30 meeting
but not within forty-five days after the
vote on January 25. <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 5. Based on
section 2691(3)(G), we concluded that the
Beckfords' appeal was untimely. <EM>Id.</EM> &para;&para; 8,
17-23. We explained that at its earlier
meeting, "the ZBA <EM>fully disposed of all the
issues raised in the Beckfords' appeal</EM> and
then, in a comprehensive and unified way,
denied the appeal, leaving only the task of
issuing written findings as the Ordinance
required." <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 19 (emphasis added).

<P20>[&para;22] Several points distinguish this case
from <EM>Beckford.</EM> Here, the ZBA at its June
23, 2022, meeting did not "fully dispose[]
of all of the issues raised in [Nelligan's]
appeal," <EM>id.</EM><fnr4> Although the ZBA voted to
grant Nelligan's appeal on the commercial
road standards issue at the June 23, 2022,
meeting, the record shows that how the
ZBA would decide some of Nelligan's other
issues remained unclear until the July
28, 2022, meeting. Further, in concluding
that Nelligan's remaining contentions need
not be addressed because they presented
"enforcement issues," the July 28, 2022,
written decision differed from what was
discussed and decided at the June 23,
2022, meeting, at which no such conclusion
was adopted. Finally, the ZBA's failure to
issue a "[n]otice of any decision" within
seven days after its June 23, 2022, meeting
confirms that it did not purport to make an
appealable decision at that meeting. 30-A
M.R.S. &sect; 2691(3)(E).

<P20>[&para;23] We conclude that Moreau's Rule
80B appeal was timely filed.

<HN02><EMB>B. Whether Moreau's Commercial Use
of His Lot Violates the Ordinance</EMB>

<P20>[&para;24] Nelligan and the Town argue primarily
that Moreau is not entitled to a
permit for the automotive repair shop because
his commercial use of his lot requires
his access road to comply with the
<Page 55>
commercial road standards prescribed at
section 6(N) of article II of the ordinance
and the fifty-foot-wide Reed Lane right-of-way
does not comply with the sixty-foot-width
requirement in the standards. In
addition, they argue that the Planning
Board's decision must be vacated in any
event because the Planning Board failed to
make findings sufficient to explain and
support its ruling. Moreau responds that
the ordinance's road standards, Land Use
and Development Ordinance art. II,
&sect; 6(N), do not apply to private access
roads like Reed Lane and that, even if the
commercial road standards did apply to
such roads, his lot would be grandfathered
and need not comply. As to the Planning
Board's findings, Moreau urges us to affirm
the court's judgment upholding the
Planning Board's decision on the basis of
inferred findings.

<HN24><EMB>1. Standard of Review</EMB>

<P20>[&para;25] "In a Rule 80B appeal, the
Superior Court acts in an appellate capacity,
and, therefore, we review the agency's
decision directly." <EM>21 Seabran, LLC v.
Town of Naples,</EM> 2017 ME 3, &para; 9, 153 A.3d
113 (quotation marks omitted). The administrative
decision on review here is that of
the Planning Board because the Parsonsfield
Zoning Board of Appeals "acts only in
an appellate capacity in this context," <EM>Odiorne
Lane Solar, LLC v. Town of Eliot,</EM>
2023 ME 67, &para; 4, 304 A.3d 253; <EM>see Mills v.
Town of Eliot,</EM> 2008 ME 134, &para;&para; 13-16, 955
A.2d 258; <EM>Bryant v. Town of Wiscasset,</EM>
2017 ME 234, &para; 11, 176 A.3d 176; Land
Use and Development Ordinance art. VI,
&sect; 2(A)(1).

<P20>[&para;26] "On review of the action of a
municipal planning board, we may not
make factual findings independent of those
explicitly or implicitly found by the municipal
authority, nor may we substitute our
judgment for that of the municipal authority."
<EM>Brown v. Town of Kennebunkport,</EM> 565
A.2d 324, 327 (Me. 1989).

<P20>[&para;27] On questions of law our
review is de novo, but we "accord substantial
deference to the Planning Board's
characterizations and fact-findings as to
what meets ordinance standards." <EM>Bryant,</EM>
2017 ME 234, &para; 12, 176 A.3d 176 (quotation
marks omitted). When we interpret an ordinance,
we "look first to the plain meaning
of its language, and if the meaning of
the ordinance is clear," we do not go beyond
it. <EM>21 Seabran, LLC,</EM> 2017 ME 3, &para; 12,
153 A.3d 113. If a term is defined in an
ordinance, we will not redefine it. <EM>Id.</EM> "In
construing the language of an ordinance,
the ordinance is to be considered as a
whole." <EM>Jade Realty Corp. v. Town of Eliot,</EM>
2008 ME 80, &para; 9, 946 A.2d 408.

<HN24><EMB>2. The Status of Moreau's Lot Under
the Nonconformity and Rear-Lot
Provisions of the Ordinance</EMB>

<P20>[&para;28] Moreau's lot and Reed
Lane predate the adoption of the current
ordinance, which is stated to be March 5,
1994. Land Use and Development Ordinance
art. I, &sect; 7. The ordinance repealed
the prior zoning ordinance dating to 1987.<fnr5>
<EM>See id.</EM> The ordinance extends grandfather
status to lots, uses, and structures "legally
existing at the time of adoption or amendment
of this Ordinance" by permitting
them to continue or remain. <EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 6(A)(1).
However, the ordinance states, "Except as
hereinafter specified, no building, structure
or land shall hereafter be used or
occupied, and no building or structure or
part thereof shall hereafter be erected,
constructed, expanded, moved, or altered
except in conformity with all of the regulations
<Page 56>
herein specified for the district in
which it is located, unless a variance is
granted." <EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 5. Both the lot and Reed
Lane appear to be grandfathered for residential
use, although the lot also meets the
ordinance's dimensional requirements for
new lots, <EM>see id.</EM> art. II, &sect; 5 tbl. 2, and
Reed Lane currently complies with the
requirements of the ordinance for access
roads serving residential lots, <EM>see id.</EM>
&sect; 6(A)(2)-(3) (requiring fifty-foot-wide access
roads to residential lots).<fnr6> On the
other hand, because Moreau's commercial
use of the lot does not predate the ordinance,
it is not grandfathered.<fnr7> <EM>See Town
of Orono v. LaPointe,</EM> 1997 ME 185, &para; 13,
698 A.2d 1059 (explaining that for a use
"[t]o qualify for nonconforming or grandfathered
status, it must be shown that the
use existed prior to the enactment of the
zoning provisions [regulating] it and that
the use was actual and substantial." (quotation
marks omitted)). Nothing in the ordinance
exempts Moreau's commercial use
of the lot from full compliance with the
ordinance, including any new access requirements
that apply as a result of the
new commercial use.

<P20>[&para;29] Because Moreau's Reed
Lane lot lacks frontage on a public road,
the ordinance classifies it as a "rear lot."
<EM>See</EM> Land Use and Development Ordinance
art. I, &sect; 6(E) (providing that any lot accessed
by means of a private road "will be
classified as a rear lot unless the access
road becomes a public road").<fnr8>

<HN24><EMB>3. The Applicability of the Ordinance's
Commercial Road Standards</EMB>

<P20>[&para;30] Our analysis turns to the Town's
and Nelligan's contention that the commercial
road standards contained in section
6(N) of article II of the ordinance
apply to Reed Lane because Moreau seeks
after-the-fact approval for a commercial
use and structure on his lot. Whether the
commercial road standards apply is dispositive
&mdash;they require a right-of-way at least
sixty feet wide, but Moreau's right-of-way
is only fifty feet wide. <EM>See</EM> Land Use and
Development Ordinance art. II, &sect; 6(N) tbl.
5.

<P20>[&para;31] Moreau responds by noting that
section 6(N) states that it "applies to the
construction and/or acceptance of new
Town roads, streets, ways and/or the reconstruction
or major alteration thereof."
Land Use and Development Ordinance art.
<Page 57>
II, &sect; 6(N)(2). He contends that the standards
for private access roads such as
Reed Lane appear at article II, section
6(A) of the Ordinance. This section allows
a building permit to issue for a lot lacking
public road frontage only if it has an access
road "with a minimum width of fifty
(50) feet within a deeded right-of-way," <EM>id.</EM>
&sect; 6(A), which is a standard that Reed Lane
meets.

<P20>[&para;32] Nelligan points out that section
6(A) defines road construction requirements
applicable only to "dwelling units,"
<EM>id.</EM> &sect; 6(A)(3), and does not purport to
regulate access to lots that are used commercially.
He also contends that, although
the section 6(N) road standards do not on
their face apply to private access roads, an
ordinance provision governing private access
roads to rear lots brings the section
6(N) standards into the analysis:

<B22><EM>If serving a business</EM> ..., the access
road must meet the construction requirements
of road construction (see Article
II, Section 6, N ...).

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> art. I, &sect; 6(E) (emphasis added).

<P20>[&para;33] Although this provision does not
specify which construction requirements a
private access road must meet if it serves
a business, logic dictates that the commercial
use of a lot calls for the lot's access
road to meet commercial road standards,
not residential road standards. A practical
consideration confirms that interpretation:
some commercial uses permitted in the
Village Residential District&mdash;convenience
stores and restaurants, for example&mdash;can
involve customer vehicles and delivery
trucks coming and going at levels well
beyond the handling capacity of a fifteen-foot-wide
gravel road, which is all that the
residential access road standards at article
II, section 6(A) require.

<P20>[&para;34] Moreau contends that the
article I, section 6(E) standard for an access
road serving a business on a rear lot
does not apply because his lot was created
before the ordinance went into effect. We
conclude otherwise. As previously noted,
the grandfathered status of his lot and
Reed Lane shields them from the requirements
of the ordinance only as to the
residential use of the lot that predates the
ordinance. Moreau's commercial use of his
lot and the portion of Reed Lane between
his lot and Maplewood Road is subject to
the current ordinance. Just as Moreau's
commercial use of the lot triggers the ordinance's
site review requirements, his commercial
use of Reed Lane triggers the
article I, section 6(E) requirement that a
private access road serving a business on a
rear lot comply with the article II, section
6(N) road standards. Because the width of
the Reed Lane right-of-way does not comply,
Moreau's application for a site plan
review permit should have been denied.
<EM>See</EM> Land Use and Development Ordinance
art. II, &sect; 6(N) tbl. 5.

<P20>[&para;35] We therefore vacate the judgment
in favor of Moreau and remand for entry
of judgment affirming the ZBA's decision
in favor of Nelligan and the Town. This
result makes it unnecessary for us to consider
Nelligan's argument regarding the
inadequacy of what the court aptly characterized
as the Planning Board's "summary
determination" in lieu of the required detailed
findings.

<P20>The entry is:

<B22>Judgment vacated. Remanded to the Superior
Court with instructions to enter a
judgment affirming the decision of the
Zoning Board of Appeals.
<FN>
<fnt1> The seventeen criteria are titled: "Aesthetic,
Cultural and Natural values"; "Conformity
with Ordinances and Plans"; "Erosion"; "Financial
Burden on Town"; "Financial and
Technical Ability"; "Flood Areas"; "Freshwater
Wetlands"; "Groundwater"; "Municipal
Solid Waste Disposal"; "Municipal/Public
Water Supply"; "Neighborhood Compatibility";
"Pollution"; "River, Stream or Brook";
"Sewage Disposal"; "Storm Water"; "Sufficient
Water"; and "Traffic." Parsonsfield,
Me., Land Use and Development Ordinance
art. III, &sect; 6 (Sept. 8, 2018).

<fnt2> A second reason given in the ZBA's decision
vacating the Planning Board's decision was
that because "[t]he general structure of the
[ordinance] prohibits a second principal use
of any lot," Moreau could not use his lot for
both an existing single-family residence and
an automotive repair shop. (Emphasis omitted.)
Because the court did not address the
issue and none of the parties raises it on
appeal, we treat the issue as undeveloped and
do not address it further. <EM>See Holland v. Sebunya,</EM>
2000 ME 160, &para; 9 n.6, 759 A.2d 205
("The failure to mention an issue in the brief
or at argument is construed as either an abandonment
or a failure to preserve that issue.");
<EM>Mehlhorn v. Derby,</EM> 2006 ME 110, &para; 11, 905
A.2d 290 (declining to address an issue with
respect to which the appellants "neither supplied
argument nor suggested a rationale in
support of their position").

<P20>The third reason given by the ZBA was that
the ordinance limits to a single permitted use
rear lots accessed by private rights-of-way
that do not meet the width requirements of
the ordinance, and Moreau could not add a
new commercial use to the lot's existing residential
use. The reference is to an ordinance
provision that confers limited grandfathering
on rear lots that are served by nonconforming
access roads:

<B22>A rear lot (lacks frontage) that meets size
requirements but is accessible only by a
right-of-way that does not meet the width
requirements may be used for a single
dwelling or other single permitted use
provided that the right-of-way existed at
the effective date of this Ordinance or
amendment, and that a wider right-of-way
cannot be negotiated with abutting
landowners, and that all other relevant
provisions of this Ordinance can be met.

<P00>Land Use and Development Ordinance art. I,
&sect; 6(D)(3). The court determined that the provision
did not apply because Moreau's lot
meets the width requirement for access roads
serving residences. None of the parties argues
that the provision affects the outcome of this
appeal, and we need not discuss it further.

<fnt3> Nelligan also argues that the Superior Court
should not have considered Moreau's first two
applications for site plan review as part of the
Rule 80B record, but because we agree with
Nelligan that Moreau should not have been
granted a permit for his automotive repair
shop regardless, we need not address that
argument. <EM>Cf. Brooks v. Town of Bar Harbor,</EM>
2024 ME 21, &para; 9, 314 A.3d 205.

<fnt4> Because we conclude that the appeal was
timely, we need not address whether Moreau
had good cause to file his Rule 80B complaint
when he did. <EM>Cf. Brooks,</EM> 2024 ME 21, &para;&para; 7-9,
314 A.3d 205.

<fnt5> The parties agree that the version of the
ordinance that applies to their dispute is the
most recent version, amended on September
8, 2018.

<fnt6> Nelligan contends that Reed Lane is not
grandfathered because it was not created until
"after zoning was adopted," but the ordinance
extends grandfather status to lots and
uses "legally existing" before the ordinance
itself was adopted. <EM>See</EM> Land Use and Development
Ordinance art. I, &sect; 6(A)(1). Whether
Reed Lane was "legally existing" under the
terms of the 1987 zoning ordinance is unclear,
but the question is moot as to the residential
use of Moreau's lot because Reed
Lane is currently compliant with the standards
for private access roads to lots with
residential uses.

<fnt7> "The test for determining whether a proposed
property use fits within a grandfathered
nonconforming use is: (1) whether the use
reflects the `nature and purpose' of the use
prevailing when the zoning legislation took
effect; (2) whether there is created a use different
in quality or character, as well as in
degree, from the original use, or (3) whether
the current use is different in kind in its effect
on the neighborhood." <EM>Total Quality, Inc. v.
Town of Scarborough,</EM> 588 A.2d 283, 284-85
(Me. 1991) (quoting <EM>Keith v. Saco River Corridor
Comm'n,</EM> 464 A.2d 150, 155 (Me. 1983)).

<fnt8> The ordinance's definition of "road" as being
"[a]n existing state, county, or town way
or a street dedicated for public use," Land
Use and Development Ordinance Appendix A,
<EM>Road,</EM> along with the ordinance's description
of rear lots as being those lots "without the
required road frontage," <EM>id.</EM> art. I, &sect; 6(E),
confirm that Moreau's lot is a rear lot because
it lacks frontage on a public road.

<P20>[&para;1] High Maine, LLC, appeals from a
judgment of the Superior Court (York
County, <EM>Mulhern, J.</EM>) dismissing its complaint
for lack of standing. Its complaint
challenged the Town of Kittery's issuance
of a marijuana retail store license and
approval of a change of use and modified
site plan for GTF Kittery 8, LLC, to operate
a marijuana retail store in the Town's
C-2 zone. <EM>See</EM> M.R. Civ. P. 80B. Because
we agree with High Maine that the complaint's
allegations were sufficient at the
motion to dismiss stage to demonstrate its
standing, we vacate the judgment of the
Superior Court and remand for further
proceedings.

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<HN02><EMB>A. Administrative and Judicial Standing</EMB>

<P20>[&para;2] When a complaint challenges a
municipal decision, there are two potentially
relevant standing issues: the standing
required to challenge governmental action
at the municipal level and the standing
required to challenge municipal action in
court. <EM>See Upstream Watch v. City of Belfast,</EM>
2023 ME 43, &para; 24, 299 A.3d 25. Although
the Town stated in its motion that
it was challenging High Maine's "administrative
standing," the substance of the
Town's challenge has been to judicial
standing, not to the standing needed to
participate in an administrative proceeding.
The Superior Court so treated the
motion, and we do the same.

<P20>[&para;3] In the proceedings before the
Superior Court, a party to a Rule 80B
complaint for judicial review of governmental
action may challenge the plaintiff's
standing to sue in court through two different
mechanisms: as a motion to dismiss
after the filing of the complaint, <EM>see</EM> M.R.
<Page 61>
Civ. P. 12(b)(6), or as a component of the
appellee's brief, <EM>see</EM> M.R. Civ. P. 80B(g).

<P20>[&para;4] When, as here, a defendant
in a Rule 80B action files a motion to
dismiss for lack of standing prior to the
submission of the administrative record,
we look to the allegations of the complaint
to identify the relevant factual predicate
for our review.<fnr1> <EM>See Hammond Lumber
Co. v. Fin. Auth. of Me.,</EM> 521 A.2d 283, 286-87
(Me. 1987) (reviewing the allegations of
a Rule 80C petition to determine standing);
<EM>see generally Harmon v. Harmon,</EM>
404 A.2d 1020, 1021 (Me. 1979) ("All well-pleaded
material allegations of the complaint
are taken as admitted for purposes
of a motion to dismiss for ... want of
standing."). That factual predicate in this
instance is as follows.

<HN02><EMB>B. Facts and Procedural History</EMB>

<P20>[&para;5] In 2021, GTF Kittery 8 pre-applied
for a marijuana retail store license in the
C-2 zone in the Town, following a process
set forth in the Town Code. <EM>See</EM> Kittery,
Me., Code &sect;&sect; 5.11.3, 5.11.9 (Aug. 9, 2021).
Under the Code, only one marijuana retail
store is permitted in each zone in which
marijuana retail stores are allowed. <EM>Id.</EM>
&sect; 5.11.9(A). No business may have more
than one marijuana retail store in the
Town; Tax Identification Numbers (TINs)
are used to confirm compliance. <EM>Id.</EM>
&sect; 5.11.9(B).

<P20>[&para;6] To obtain a license, an entity must
first submit a pre-application form and
supporting documentation, pay a fee, be
certified as eligible by the Town, and be
selected through a lottery. <EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 5.11.9(C)-(D).
If a pre-application is not immediately
selected in the lottery, it is placed on a
waiting list in the order in which it was
drawn, with any pre-applications submitted
and certified after the lottery added to
the end of the list. <EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 5.11.9(E). "Applications
will not be processed from the wait
list if there have been any material
changes to ownership, as indicated on the
ownership affidavit, or where there is a
change to location of the premises." <EM>Id.</EM>
When a license becomes available in a
zone, the Town invites the next pre-applicant
on the waiting list for that zone to
apply for the license. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>[&para;7] Here, GTF Kittery 8 filed two pre-applications
to operate a marijuana retail
store at 89 Route 236&mdash;one pre-application
(MPA-446) proposing to operate on the
first floor and one pre-application (MPA-505)
proposing to operate on the second
floor. Twenty-five other "GTF" entities
also pre-applied for permits for the same
building, each also submitting one pre-application
for the first floor and one pre-application
for the second floor. The building
at 89 Route 236 is within 1,000 feet of
the Great Beginnings Nursery School.

<P20>[&para;8] The Town held an initial lottery of
the pre-applications in October 2021, and
GTF Kittery 8 was put on the waiting list.
On February 27, 2023, the Town invited
GTF Kittery 8 to submit an application.
GTF Kittery 8 submitted a license application,
application for a change of use, and
<Page 62>
modified site plan. It proposed operating a
marijuana retail store on both the first and
second floors of 89 Route 236, rather than
operating only on the second floor as proposed
in the pre-application.

<P20>[&para;9] High Maine, a limited liability company
which has a principal place of business
in Kittery, had also pre-applied for a
license to operate a marijuana retail store
in the Town's C-2 zone, with its proposed
store to be located at 1 Route 236. On
June 6, 2023, High Maine objected to GTF
Kittery 8's change in the location of the
premises to encompass two floors and argued
to the Planning Board that the Board
should not approve GTF Kittery 8's
change of use and modified site plan because
the proposed use would violate 28-B
M.R.S. &sect; 402(2)(A) (2024) by authorizing a
cannabis establishment within 1,000 feet of
a school. Over High Maine's objections, on
September 14, 2023, the Town's Planning
Board approved GTF Kittery 8's application
for the change of use and approved
the modified site plan. On October 9, 2023,
High Maine objected to the issuance of a
license to GTF Kittery 8. The Town Council
voted to approve the license application
on October 11, 2023.

<P20>[&para;10] On October 27, 2023, High Maine
filed a complaint in the Superior Court
seeking judicial review of the Town's land
use approvals and licensing of GTF Kittery
8. <EM>See</EM> M.R. Civ. P. 80B. The Town
moved to dismiss the complaint on the
ground that High Maine failed to allege a
particularized injury and therefore lacks
standing. High Maine opposed the motion
and argued that as a pre-applicant with a
prospective business interest at stake, it
has standing to challenge the validity of
the Town's actions. The Town replied that
although High Maine may be affected by
the Town's decisions, a diminished opportunity
to apply for a license is too abstract
to constitute an injury sufficient to support
standing.

<P20>[&para;11] On January 26, 2024, the court
dismissed the complaint for lack of standing,
reasoning that High Maine is not directly
affected by the Town's decisions
because its status as a prospective license-holder
on the waiting list was unchanged
before and after the Town's decisions.
High Maine timely appealed to us. <EM>See</EM> 14
M.R.S. &sect; 1851 (2024); M.R. Civ. P. 80B(n);
M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(1).

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<P20>[&para;12] We review de novo a
court's dismissal of a Rule 80B complaint
for lack of standing. <EM>Friends of Lincoln
Lakes v. Town of Lincoln,</EM> 2010 ME 78,
&para; 8, 2 A.3d 284. When reviewing a motion
to dismiss a Rule 80B complaint, we examine
the complaint "in the light most favorable
to the plaintiff to determine whether
it sets forth elements of a cause of action
or alleges facts that would entitle the
plaintiff to relief pursuant to some legal
theory." <EM>Paul v. Town of Liberty,</EM> 2016 ME
173, &para; 19, 151 A.3d 924 (quotation marks
omitted).

<P20>[&para;13] To establish judicial standing
to file an appeal pursuant to Rule 80B,
the plaintiff must have both (1) participated
in the relevant administrative proceedings
and (2) "suffered a particularized injury"
as a result of the challenged municipal
decision. <EM>Norris Fam. Assocs., LLC v.
Town of Phippsburg,</EM> 2005 ME 102, &para; 11,
879 A.2d 1007. The Town does not challenge
High Maine's standing based on the
first requirement, so we focus on whether
the allegations of High Maine's complaint
indicate that it suffered a particularized
injury. "A particularized injury occurs
when a judgment or order adversely and
directly affects a party's property, pecuniary,
or personal rights. A person suffers a
particularized injury only when that person
<Page 63>
suffers injury or harm that is in fact
distinct from the harm experienced by the
public at large." <EM>Nergaard v. Town of
Westport Island,</EM> 2009 ME 56, &para; 18, 973
A.2d 735 (citations and quotation marks
omitted).

<P20>[&para;14] If a party's legal rights
and responsibilities are unchanged by a
decision, the party will not have standing
to challenge the decision. <EM>See Great Hill
Fill & Gravel, Inc. v. Bd. of Env't Prot.,</EM>
641 A.2d 184, 184-85 (Me. 1994). "Being
affected by a governmental action is insufficient
to confer standing in the absence of
any showing that the effect is an injury,"
<EM>Lindemann v. Comm'n on Govt'l Ethics &
Elec. Pracs.,</EM> 2008 ME 187, &para; 15, 961 A.2d
538 (quotation marks omitted), and an injury
is not particularized if it is suffered
equally by all citizens, <EM>see Ricci v. Superintendent,
Bureau of Banking,</EM> 485 A.2d
645, 647 (Me. 1984) (concluding that the
plaintiffs lacked standing when their complaint
alleged only that they were Maine
citizens and that because of the Superintendent's
allegedly deficient publication of
notice, "they failed to receive adequate
notice of Key Bank's application and of
their right to participate in the application
process"). "Just what particular interest or
injury is required for standing purposes
... varies based on the type of claims
being alleged." <EM>Black v. Bureau of Parks
& Lands,</EM> 2022 ME 58, &para; 27, 288 A.3d 346
(quotation marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;15] For example, courts generally
consider abutters and owners of
property in the same neighborhood as the
property on which a use is proposed to
have standing to bring land use appeals,
whereas those whose property is not near
the proposed use lack standing unless they
show that some other interest of theirs will
be affected.<fnr2> <EM>Nergaard,</EM> 2009 ME 56, &para;&para; 18-22,
973 A.2d 735. As another example,
those who made substantial use of Baxter
State Park had standing to challenge a
decision authorizing the use of heavy
equipment to harvest blow-down timber in
the Park. <EM>Fitzgerald v. Baxter State Park
Auth.,</EM> 385 A.2d 189, 191, 197 (Me. 1978).

<P20>[&para;16] A business competitor may
have standing if it was a party to the
proceedings and the proposed governmental
action would result in substantial detriment
to the competitor and adversely affect
its business. <EM>Hammond Lumber Co.,</EM>
521 A.2d at 286-87. For instance, "an existing
nursing home in the ... area ...
suffered a direct and particularized injury
when the Department issued a [certificate
of need] for the construction of 70 additional
beds in the same city to a competitor."
<EM>Bradbury Mem'l Nursing Home v.
Tall Pines Manor Assocs.,</EM> 485 A.2d 634,
638 (Me. 1984). We similarly concluded
that a corporation had standing to challenge
the validity of a Portland ordinance
when the corporation was "in the business
of running pre-release facilities" and was
"intent on expanding its operation," but
"the Portland Ordinance as amended preclude[d]
any such expansion." <EM>Halfway
House, Inc. v. City of Portland,</EM> 670 A.2d
1377, 1381 (Me. 1996).
<Page 64>

<P20>[&para;17] Construing the complaint in
the light most favorable to High Maine, it
has alleged a particularized injury as a
pre-applicant on the waiting list to apply
for a marijuana retail store license.<fnr3> Unlike
the public at large, High Maine's prospect
for obtaining the single license available in
the C-2 zone is directly and negatively
affected by the alleged defects in the process
and resulting licensing decision. <EM>See
Ricci,</EM> 485 A.2d at 647; <EM>Nergaard,</EM> 2009 ME
56, &para; 18, 973 A.2d 735. The complaint
alleges not only that GTF Kittery 8 received
a license to operate a marijuana
retail store in a building in which it is
illegal to operate under state law, <EM>see</EM> 28-B
M.R.S. &sect; 402(2)(A), but that fifty-one other
pre-applications were filed as to that building.
Success on its complaint could therefore
potentially bring High Maine's pre-application
to a significantly better position
in relation to the other pre-applications on
the waiting list. <EM>See Hammond Lumber
Co.,</EM> 521 A.2d at 286-87; <EM>Bradbury Mem'l
Nursing Home,</EM> 485 A.2d at 638. Furthermore,
accepting High Maine's allegations
as true, GTF Kittery 8 obtained an unfair
advantage in the lottery by submitting two
applications (one for the first floor and one
for the second floor) for a location that, as
merged in the site plan review process,
became approved as a single, two-floor
location.

<P20>[&para;18] High Maine's complaint in essence
alleges that because of a flawed process, it
was deprived of the opportunity to compete
on an equal footing with GTF Kittery
8 for the one license available in the C-2
zone. A similar theory of standing exists
when a plaintiff that has bid on a government
contract alleges that the selection
process was illegally flawed. <EM>See Planned
Parenthood of Greater Washington & N.
Idaho v. U.S. Dep't of Health & Hum.
Servs.,</EM> 946 F.3d 1100, 1108 (9th Cir. 2020)
("[T]he inability to compete on an equal
footing in [a] bidding process is sufficient
to establish injury-in-fact." (quotation
marks omitted)); <EM>Free Air Corp. v. F.C.C.,</EM>
130 F.3d 447, 450 (D.C. Cir. 1997) ("[S]ufficiently
viable runners-up in a procurement
process have standing to allege that an
illegality in the process caused the contract
to go to someone else and not to
them.").

<P20>[&para;19] Pre-applicant High Maine has alleged
defects in the process that resulted
in a particularized injury to it that is separate
and distinct from any harm to the
public at large. <EM>See Nergaard,</EM> 2009 ME 56,
&para; 18, 973 A.2d 735. Because the complaint's
allegations are thus adequate to support
High Maine's standing, we vacate the
judgment dismissing the complaint and remand
for further proceedings.

<P20>The entry is:

<B22>Judgment of dismissal vacated. Remanded
for further proceedings.
<FN>
<fnt1> The complaint here summarizes the pertinent
provisions of the Town Code, but presumably
because the administrative record
was not yet due when the Town filed its
motion to dismiss, <EM>see</EM> M.R. Civ. P. 80B(e)(1),
(g), the Code itself was not yet part of the
record before the trial court. Because High
Maine provided the licensing provisions of the
Town Code in the appendix on appeal and the
Town raised no opposition, we include citations
to those provisions in our recitation of
the facts and consider their impact as well.
We note, however, that moving to dismiss
before an administrative record is produced
could, in other cases, affect the justiciability
of an appeal, because we cannot take judicial
notice of municipal ordinances. <EM>See Odiorne
Lane Solar, LLC v. Town of Eliot,</EM> 2023 ME
67, &para; 16 n.9, 304 A.3d 253; <EM>Mills v. Town of
Eliot,</EM> 2008 ME 134, &para; 23, 955 A.2d 258.

<fnt2> In some cases, the "potential for particularized
injury" is sufficient for an abutter to have
standing, <EM>Fryeburg Water Co. v. Town of Fryeburg,</EM>
2006 ME 31, &para;&para; 11-12, 893 A.2d 618
(quotation marks omitted), as when an abutter
proposes a landfill, <EM>In re Lappie,</EM> 377 A.2d
441, 441, 443 (Me. 1977); a sludge-disposal
operation, <EM>Pride's Corner Concerned Citizens
Ass'n v. Westbrook Bd. of Zoning Appeals,</EM> 398
A.2d 415, 418 (Me. 1979); a competing convenience
store, <EM>Christy's Realty Ltd. P'ship v.
Town of Kittery,</EM> 663 A.2d 59, 61-62 (Me.
1995); or the installation of self-service gas
pumps at a store, <EM>Singal v. City of Bangor,</EM> 440
A.2d 1048, 1051 (Me. 1982), <EM>overruled in part
on other grounds by Norris Fam. Assocs., LLC,</EM>
2005 ME 102, &para;&para; 12-13, 879 A.2d 1007.

<fnt3> Although High Maine did not allege that it
is qualified to hold a license, the allegations in
the complaint are sufficient for us to infer
that fact for purposes of the motion to dismiss.
<EM>See Nadeau v. Frydrych,</EM> 2014 ME 154,
&para; 8, 108 A.3d 1254 (holding that a complaint
satisfied the notice pleading standard based
on a "reasonable inference" that could be
drawn from the complaint's allegations).

<P20>[&para;1] Trevor I. DesRosiers appeals from
a judgment of conviction entered by the
trial court (Penobscot County, <EM>Mallonee
J.</EM>) after a jury returned guilty verdicts on
three counts of sexual abuse of a minor
and three counts of furnishing liquor to a
minor. DesRosiers argues that there was
insufficient evidence presented at trial to
establish that he and the victim were not
married at the time they engaged in the
sexual acts or to establish the victim's age
in Counts 1-4 of the indictment, and that
the State committed multiple incidents of
prosecutorial error in its closing arguments
that, individually or cumulatively,
deprived him of a fair trial. We disagree
with DesRosiers's arguments regarding
the sufficiency of the evidence, and although
one of the prosecutor's comments
constituted error, it was harmless beyond
a reasonable doubt; hence, we affirm the
judgment.

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<P20>[&para;2] "We recite the evidence in the light
most favorable to the verdict." <EM>State v.
Harding,</EM> 2024 ME 67, &para; 2, 322 A.3d 1175.

<HN00><EMB>A. Initial Investigation</EMB>

<P20>[&para;3] On May 21, 2020, while washing
dishes, the victim's grandmother saw,
through her kitchen window, the victim
leave her parents' home and proceed
through a small patch of woods next to the
grandmother's house. The grandmother
thought that the victim was coming to visit
her, but when the victim reached the
grandmother's lawn, she darted out to the
road and headed away from the house. The
grandmother called the victim's mother,
who proceeded to her car to search for her
daughter. While searching, the mother saw
the victim in the passenger seat of a Jeep
driven by an older man wearing a cowboy
hat. The mother immediately pulled her
car over and called 9-1-1; in doing so, she
lost track of the Jeep.

<P20>[&para;4] A Maine State Police trooper responded
and, after speaking with the
mother, continued to canvas the area.
While canvassing, the trooper received information
from multiple sources that led
him to DesRosiers's home. When the
trooper arrived, he saw a Jeep parked next
to a camper trailer.

<P20>[&para;5] As the trooper testified and as captured
by the audio of his cruiser's camera,
the trooper went to the front door of the
camper and announced himself as State
Police. Through a camper window, the
trooper watched as DesRosiers put on his
pants and made his way to the door. When
DesRosiers opened the door, the trooper
observed that DesRosiers had an erection.
The trooper asked DesRosiers where
"she" was. When DesRosiers responded
<Page 69>
that there was no one inside the camper,
the trooper asked for consent to search the
camper, which DesRosiers refused.

<P20>[&para;6] After denying that there was anyone
in the camper, when the trooper informed
him that he was looking for the
victim, identifying her as fifteen years old,
DesRosiers responded, "I don't know
where she is. She must have run out the
window." DesRosiers then said that he
would send her out and can be heard on
the audio yelling, "It's time to get up you
gotta go." Seconds later, DesRosiers came
back to the door and said, "Nope, she ain't
here bubba, I ain't letting you in man you
gotta get a warrant I'm sorry I don't know
what to do man ... she ran." DesRosiers
then turned back into the camper and said,
"You gotta go."

<P20>[&para;7] During this interaction, the trooper
shined his flashlight through the camper
window and saw the victim emerge from
DesRosiers's bed, wearing no clothing other
than a bra. DesRosiers yelled at the
victim, "What the fuck is wrong with you?
You lied to me" and "I can't even believe
you, but I'm glad I didn't fuck you." Despite
denying to the trooper that any sexual
acts occurred between him and the victim,
DesRosiers later confirmed to a friend
that he and the victim had had sex.

<P20>[&para;8] The victim initially denied that she
and DesRosiers had had sex. After working
with a therapist, however, she disclosed
to her mother that she and DesRosiers
had had sex on multiple occasions.
The mother then called the trooper, who
made a referral to the Child Advocacy
Center (CAC) for an interview. Based on
information disclosed during the CAC interview,
the trooper drafted a search warrant
and obtained DesRosiers's and the
victim's Facebook messages.

<HN00><EMB>B. Facebook Messages</EMB>

<P20>[&para;9] The Facebook messages showed
that DesRosiers contacted the victim on
May 7, 2020. DesRosiers asked the victim
how old she was, and she told him that she
was fifteen,<fnr1> to which he responded, "I
would totally chill with you, but I don't
want your parents to shoot me." DesRosiers
then asked the victim whether she
wanted to sneak out and arranged to pick
her up later that evening and supply her
with alcoholic beverages. DesRosiers and
the victim corresponded until late in the
evening on May 7, when DesRosiers
picked up the victim, and the two stayed in
his camper until May 8.

<P20>[&para;10] DesRosiers and the victim continued
communicating over Facebook and arranging
meeting times. On May 19, 2020,
DesRosiers messaged the victim and said,
"Here I am building a house[], looking for
a wife, wanting to settle down.... And
you come along." He added, "You tell me
you want me, and love me, you want to be
with me, but your under age.... I'm
having a hard time telling you no....
This hurts."

<P20>[&para;11] On May 11, 2020, DesRosiers and
the victim also discussed the prospect of
the victim's emancipation. The victim messaged
DesRosiers that she was trying to
become emancipated so that she could see
him and stay with him more often, to
which he responded that he understood
but if he told her parents that they would
not go out without her parent's permission,
her parents might like him more. The Facebook
messages show that DesRosiers
and the victim continued to discuss emancipation
until May 21, the night that the
trooper arrived at DesRosiers's camper.
<Page 70>
Even after the trooper had picked up the
victim from DesRosiers's home on May 21,
DesRosiers continued to message the victim,
saying, "I'm glad I didn't fuck you ...
I would be in a lot of trouble if I slept with
you."

<HN00><EMB>C. Arrest and Trial</EMB>

<P20>[&para;12] DesRosiers was arrested and
charged by complaint on June 21, 2022,
and indicted by a grand jury on March 1,
2023. The indictment charged DesRosiers
with committing six crimes under two statutes
over three separate days: sexual
abuse of a minor (Class C), 17-A M.R.S.
&sect; 254(1)(A), (A-2) (2024), and furnishing
liquor to a minor (Class D), 28-A M.R.S.
&sect; 2081(1)(A)(2) (2024), on or about May 8,
2020 (Counts 1-2), May 16, 2020 (Counts 3-4),
and May 21, 2020 (Counts 5-6).

<P20>[&para;13] A jury trial was held on April 20
and 21, 2023, during which the jury heard
testimony from the victim, the victim's
mother, the victim's grandmother, the
trooper, a witness who assisted the trooper
in locating DesRosiers's Jeep, and an acquaintance
of DesRosiers.

<P20>[&para;14] The victim testified that her relationship
with DesRosiers lasted approximately
four weeks. They began communicating
when DesRosiers added her as a
friend on Facebook and sent her a message.
She testified that May 7, 2020, was
the first time they conversed online and
agreed to meet up and go to his camper to
drink together and hang out. She testified
they also smoked marijuana and had sex.
She described how they did not have oral
sex on the first night but that they did
have intercourse.

<P20>[&para;15] The victim testified that DesRosiers
was worried about getting caught talking
with her and having sex with her, so he
told her never to discuss sex or intimacy
online, but said that if they did, she needed
to delete it later.<fnr2> DesRosiers asked her to
send messages to make it look like she
"wanted him."

<P20>[&para;16] The victim described hanging out
with DesRosiers again two or three days
after they first met up. She testified that
during one of her encounters with DesRosiers,
they had sex in a different position,
which resulted in her having a bad feeling
over her whole body, but that they continued
to see each other after that incident.

<P20>[&para;17] The victim also described the night
of May 21, when the trooper arrived at
DesRosiers's camper while she and DesRosiers
were in bed together. She said
that after DesRosiers picked her up, they
went to his camper, drank alcohol, and
then had sex. She then described seeing
headlights in the driveway and telling DesRosiers
that it was a police officer. She
said that after telling DesRosiers "it was a
cop car," he "freaked out" and told her to
get down and stay there. The victim said
that she was surprised when she heard
DesRosiers say that he was glad that they
did not have sex because they had had sex
on multiple occasions. When asked how
many times she and DesRosiers had had
sex between the night they first met and
when the trooper arrived on May 21, the
victim said it was almost every time she
was with him, but she could not say exactly
how many times. She also testified that
DesRosiers provided her with alcohol almost
every time they were together.
<Page 71>

<P20>[&para;18] At the close of the State's evidence
on the second day of trial, DesRosiers
orally moved for a judgment of acquittal
on the three counts of sexual abuse of a
minor, arguing that the State did not
prove that DesRosiers and the victim were
not married, which is an element of the
crime. <EM>See</EM> 17-A M.R.S. &sect; 254(1)(A), (A-2).
The trial court denied the motion.

<P20>[&para;19] Thereafter, in his closing, the prosecutor
included the following comments:

<B22>[O]ne of the things we want to emphasize
again is that sexual abuse of a minor
means that in this case [the victim]
was 15 and the person who was having
sex with her was more than ten years
older. Whether she consented or not is
absolutely irrelevant.... [T]he statute
is designed to protect younger people.
And now that you've heard the evidence,
you can understand why we have such a
law, given the facts that you've learned,
why this defendant is prohibited from
doing what he did.

<P00>The prosecutor added:

<B22>[W]e identify what type of person [DesRosiers]
is, thirty-five-year-old man with
a 15-year-old girl. And the type of person
that he is is a big part of this case
because it shows you that not only was
he ... taking advantage of a 15-year-old
girl but he was being devious, very devious.
And this deviousness that we're
talking about is certainly emphasized in
that initial conversation that he had with
[the] Trooper.

<P00>The prosecutor continued, arguing, in reference
to the video of the May 21, 2020,
interaction between the trooper and DesRosiers
at the camper, that

<B22>this defendant flat out told a falsehood.
And there's another word for falsehood,
and we'll use it maybe just once or
twice, but it's based upon the evidence.
He flat out lied to that trooper, and
that's based upon the evidence. It's
based upon the evidence that he was a
liar at that moment.

<B22>...

<B22>And then when he was pressed on the
matter, he says, well, you need a warrant
to get in here. What's the implication
of that.

<B22>...

<B22>Now, as the evidence in this case progresses,
we not only just find out who,
we're starting to find out what type of
person he is. We also find out how it
came to be that this defendant was able
to use the circumstances of this rural
area at this time in our lives, the pandemic.
He used the &mdash; he used the fact
that [the victim] was 15 years old.

<P00>Finally, in rebuttal, the prosecutor added:

<B22>Credibility, believability, who's telling
the truth, that's important. And we
would suggest to you there's nothing in
this record that you've heard today that
[could] make you pause about whether
or not [the victim] was being up front or
whether or not this trooper was being
accurate....

<B22>And then to cast aspersions upon [a
witness] who went out of her way to
help this fella, to suggest that she came
in here and deliberately told you something
that wasn't true, that's why we
rely on you folks. That's why you're
here, to distinguish between fact and
fiction.

<B22>Facts are what you heard from the witness
stand. The fiction is what he told
[the] Trooper ... that night. One thing
after another was fiction. What you
heard in this courtroom was fact. Thank
you.

<P00>DesRosiers did not object to any of these
comments at trial.

<P20>[&para;20] The jury found DesRosiers guilty
of all six counts, and the court entered a
<Page 72>
judgment of conviction. Following the verdict,
DesRosiers again moved for a judgment
of acquittal on the three counts of
sexual abuse of a minor, which motion the
court again denied. <EM>See</EM> M.R.U. Crim. P.
29(b). The court subsequently sentenced
DesRosiers to three concurrent terms of
imprisonment of forty-two months, with all
but twenty months suspended, for the
counts of sexual abuse of a minor, and
three concurrent terms of imprisonment of
three months for the counts of furnishing
liquor to a minor. DesRosiers timely appealed.
M.R. App. P. 2B(b)(1).

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<HN02><EMB>A. There was sufficient evidence to
sustain the jury's verdict.</EMB>

<HN24><EMB>1. Standard of Review</EMB>

<P20>[&para;21] When reviewing a challenge
to the sufficiency of the evidence
supporting a conviction, we view the evidence
presented at trial in the light most
favorable to the verdict to "determine
whether any trier of fact rationally could
find beyond a reasonable doubt every element
of the offense charged." <EM>State v. Pelletier,</EM>
534 A.2d 970, 972 (Me. 1987); <EM>see
also Harding,</EM> 2024 ME 67, &para; 2, 322 A.3d
1175. Circumstantial evidence is sufficient
to establish elements of a crime, <EM>see State
v. Weisbrode,</EM> 653 A.2d 411, 415 (Me. 1995),
and a "conviction based on circumstantial
evidence may be affirmed even if the inferences
drawn from circumstantial evidence
are contradicted by parts of the direct
evidence," <EM>State v. Tieman,</EM> 2019 ME 60,
&para; 19, 207 A.3d 618 (quotation marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;22] Notably, in assessing the evidence,
a jury is not required to leave its
common sense at the courthouse door. <EM>See
State v. Trask,</EM> 223 A.2d 823, 827 (Me.
1966) ("Jurors, as well as courts, are permitted
to use their common sense in drawing
conclusions that naturally are to be
drawn from facts proved." (quotation
marks omitted)); <EM>cf. State v. Dube,</EM> 2016
ME 50, &para; 17, 136 A.3d 93;<fnr3> <EM>United States v.
Ortiz,</EM> 966 F.2d 707, 712 (1st Cir. 1992).<fnr4>

<HN24><EMB>2. There was sufficient evidence to
establish that DesRosiers and the
victim were not married.</EMB>

<P20>[&para;23] Someone is guilty of sexual
abuse of a minor if that "person engages in
a sexual act with another person, not the
actor's spouse, who is either 14 or 15 years
of age and the actor .... is at least 10
years older than the other person." 17-A
M.R.S. &sect; 254(1)(A), (A-2). DesRosiers argues
that the State never established that
<Page 73>
he and the victim were not married and,
therefore, a jury could not have found
beyond a reasonable doubt facts supporting
the non-spousal element. The State
concedes that there is no direct evidence in
the record to establish that DesRosiers
and the victim were not married when the
sexual acts occurred but argues that the
record "leads inexorably" to the conclusion
that the two were not married. We agree
with the State.

<P20>[&para;24] Although at times it may be
awkward for a prosecutor to elicit testimony
from a youthful victim that the victim
was not married to the perpetrator of a
sexual crime, that testimony or other direct
evidence is the most secure route to
prove this element of the crime. That said,
however, circumstantial evidence may suffice.
<EM>See, e.g., State v. Joel H.,</EM> 2000 ME
139, &para;&para; 2-12, 15-16, 755 A.2d 520 (affirming
a conviction in the absence of direct evidence
of non-marital status, identifying as
supporting that conclusion factors such as
the age differential between the victim and
the defendant and that the defendant lived
in a different household from the victim).<fnr5>

<P20>[&para;25] Here, the evidence established that
the victim was fifteen, attending school,
and living with her parents. The entirety
of the relationship between the victim and
DesRosiers, who was thirty-five years old,
lasted one month, beginning with Facebook
messaging and ending when the victim
was found in DesRosiers's camper.
The victim snuck out to meet DesRosiers,
with her mother asking the police to find
her daughter after the victim's grandmother
saw the victim surreptitiously leaving
her home. Instead of indicating that she
was married to DesRosiers, the victim at
first denied that she had ever had sex with
him, and she never thereafter suggested
that she and DesRosiers were married.

<P20>[&para;26] When the victim told DesRosiers,
before they met in person, that she was
<Page 74>
fifteen years old, DesRosiers responded
that he would like to hang out but did not
want her parents to shoot him. When confronted
by the police, DesRosiers's response
was to announce (falsely) that he
was glad that he had not had sex with the
victim. As late as May 19, two days before
the trooper arrived at the camper, DesRosiers
told the victim that he was looking
for a wife, and she responded, "maybe I'm
the one you're looking for." The record
also demonstrates that DesRosiers was
discussing emancipation with the victim on
the night that the trooper arrived at the
camper and that after the victim left with
the trooper, DesRosiers messaged her to
express how glad he was that they did not
have sex because he "would be in a lot of
trouble" if he had slept with her.

<P20>[&para;27] On this record, viewing the evidence
in the light most favorable to the
verdict, there is ample evidence to support
the jury's finding that DesRosiers and the
victim were not married when they engaged
in the charged sexual acts.<fnr6>

<HN24><EMB>3. There was sufficient evidence to
establish the age of the victim on
the dates of the crimes charged.</EMB>

<P20>[&para;28] DesRosiers argues that there was
insufficient evidence to support the jury's
conclusion that Counts 1 and 2 occurred on
or about May 8, 2020, and that Counts 3
and 4 occurred on or about May 16, 2020,
and thus there was insufficient evidence to
prove the age of the victim, which is an
element of these counts, at the time of the
conduct.<fnr7>

<P20>[&para;29] For the jury to return guilty verdicts
on these charged crimes, the State
had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that the victim was fourteen or fifteen
years old during the sexual abuse, <EM>see</EM> 17-A
M.R.S. &sect; 254(1)(A), (A-2), and under eighteen
years old when furnished with liquor,
<EM>see</EM> 28-A M.R.S. &sect; 2081(1)(A)(2). The State
did not need to prove that the charged
conduct happened on any particular date
so long as it proved each element of the
charged crime. <EM>See State v. Hodgdon,</EM> 2017
ME 122, &para;&para; 11-16, 164 A.3d 959.

<P20>[&para;30] Both documentary and testimonial
evidence admitted at trial established
that the victim was fifteen on May 8,
2020, when DesRosiers picked her up and
brought her to his camper for the first
time and that on May 25, 2020, four days
after the trooper came to DesRosiers's
camper, the victim sent messages to DesRosiers
referring to herself as a fifteen-year-old.
<Page 75>
The victim also testified at trial
that she had sex with DesRosiers multiple
times between May 8, 2020, and May 21,
2020, and that he gave her alcohol almost
every time they were together. The victim
also testified as to her birthdate, which
established that she did not turn sixteen
until the fall of 2020. Thus, there was
sufficient evidence to establish that the
victim was fifteen the first time she and
DesRosiers drank together and had sex
and that&mdash;as conceded by DesRosiers&mdash;the
victim was fifteen the last time they drank
together and had sex on May 21, 2020. It
follows that she remained fifteen in the
interim, and thus, there was sufficient evidence
for the jury to determine the victim's
age for the purposes of Counts 1-4.

<HN02><EMB>B. Prosecutorial error in the State's
closing argument does not warrant
a new trial.</EMB>

<P20>[&para;31] DesRosiers argues that the State
committed four prosecutorial errors in its
closing argument and that, either separately
or cumulatively, they warrant a new
trial: (1) improper witness vouching by
opining that what DesRosiers told the
trooper on May 21, 2020, was fiction while
the testimony the jury heard at trial was
fact; (2) improperly commenting on the
defendant's credibility; (3) impermissibly
enlisting the jury to help protect minors;
and (4) implying that the jury should use
DesRosiers's invocation of his Fourth
Amendment rights as evidence of guilt.
DesRosiers asserts that these errors deprived
him of his right to a fair trial under
the federal constitution. <EM>See</EM> U.S. Const.
amend. VI; XIV, &sect; 1.<fnr8>

<HN24><EMB>1. We review DesRosiers's claims for
obvious error.</EMB>

<P20>[&para;32] DesRosiers never objected to any
of the prosecutor's comments at trial. In
<EM>Chapman v. California,</EM> the United States
Supreme Court held that an improper
prosecutorial comment that violates a defendant's
federal constitutional right does
not amount to structural error, i.e., where
prejudice is presumed and a new trial is
automatically required. 386 U.S. 18, 23-26,
87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <EM>see
also Fahy v. Connecticut,</EM> 375 U.S. 85, 86-87,
84 S.Ct. 229, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963)
(indicating that not all trial errors implicating
the U.S. Constitution are structural);
<EM>cf. Neder v. United States,</EM> 527 U.S. 1,
8, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999)
(discussing federal constitutional violations
that amount to structural error requiring
automatic vacatur).

<P20>[&para;33] In <EM>Chapman,</EM> the defendant had
objected at trial to the comment at issue,
and the Supreme Court concluded that the
appellate court had to review whether a
new trial was warranted applying a harmless
error standard of review. <EM>See Chapman,</EM>
386 U.S. at 24, 87 S.Ct. 824; <EM>see also
Brown v. Davenport,</EM> 596 U.S. 118, 124,
142 S.Ct. 1510, 212 L.Ed.2d 463 (2022) ("In
<EM>Chapman,</EM> this Court held that a <EM>preserved</EM>
claim of constitutional error identified on
direct appeal does not require reversal of a
conviction if the prosecution can establish
that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt." (emphasis added)).

<P20>[&para;34] In the absence of an objection
at trial, the plain or obvious error rule
applies. <EM>United States v. Olano,</EM> 507 U.S.
725, 732-737, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d
508 (1993). The Supreme Court has stated
that before a court will consider a claim
<Page 76>
that was not raised at the trial level, there
must be error, that error must be plain,
and it must seriously affect substantial
rights. <EM>Id.</EM> at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770. The last
requirement involves an assessment similar
to a harmless error standard, but with
the burden shifted to the defendant. <EM>See
id.</EM> at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770.

<P20>[&para;35] Finally, when presented with a
claim of cumulative error, the Supreme
Court vacated a judgment of conviction in
a case in which the errors were "pronounced
and persistent, with a probable
cumulative effect upon the jury which cannot
be disregarded as inconsequential."
<EM>Berger v. United States,</EM> 295 U.S. 78, 89, 55
S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935).<fnr9>

<HN24><EMB>2. The prosecutor did not engage in
improper witness vouching, offer
improper personal opinions regarding
the Defendant's credibility,
or improperly enlist the jury to
help protect minors.</EMB>

<P20>[&para;36] With respect to the first three
statements that DesRosiers claims constituted
prosecutorial error, none constituted
error, let alone obvious error.

<P20>[&para;37] Witness vouching occurs
when prosecutors employ the authority of
their position to personally endorse the
credibility of a witness. <EM>United States v.
Young,</EM> 470 U.S. 1, 8-9, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84
L.Ed.2d 1 (1985); <EM>United States v. Robinson,</EM>
473 F.3d 387, 396 (1st Cir. 2007). In
contrast, a prosecutor's comment regarding
the jury's job to distinguish between
fact and fiction does not constitute such
vouching but is merely a statement of the
jury's role to determine credibility and
find facts relevant to determining guilt or
innocence. <EM>See United States v. Scheffer,</EM>
523 U.S. 303, 313, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140
L.Ed.2d 413 (1998) ("A fundamental premise
of our criminal trial system is that the
<EM>jury</EM> is the lie detector." (quotation marks
omitted.)); <EM>United States v. Gaudin,</EM> 515
U.S. 506, 514-15, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132
L.Ed.2d 444 (1995) (discussing the jury's
role as factfinder and its responsibility to
apply the law to the facts found). Therefore,
if, as here, the prosecutor's comment
is tied to the evidence, there is nothing
wrong with saying, "[c]redibility, believability,
who's telling the truth, that's important.
And we would suggest to you there's
nothing <EM>in this record</EM> that you've heard
today that [could] make you pause about
whether or not [the victim] was being up
front or whether or not this trooper was
being accurate." (Emphasis added.)

<P20>[&para;38] The use by a prosecutor
of the word "lie" or "liar" is not preferred,
<EM>see</EM> Robert W. Clifford, <EM>Identifying and
Preventing Improper Prosecutorial Comment
in Closing Argument,</EM> 51 Me. L. Rev.
241, 267 (1999) ("pejorative language such
as `liar' ... [is] closely scrutinized"), and
an interjection of a personal belief as to
whether a witness lied is generally error,
<EM>see</EM> M.R. Prof. Conduct 3.4(e); <EM>State v.
Williams,</EM> 2012 ME 63, &para; 46, 52 A.3d 911
(citing <EM>United States v. Perez-Ruiz,</EM> 353
F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2003) ("A prosecutor
improperly vouches for a witness when she
... impart[s] her personal belief in a witness's
veracity or impl[ies] that the jury
should credit the prosecution's evidence
simply because the government can be
trusted.")).
<Page 77>

<P20>[&para;39] Here, however, the prosecutor's
comments were not an expression of his
personal opinion and did not invoke the
prestige of the government. Rather, they
were a description of DesRosiers's recorded
comments to the trooper on May 21,
2020, when DesRosiers made in quick succession
a series of inconsistent and incorrect
assertions.<fnr10> While the prosecutor's
choice of pejorative terminology was inadvisable,
we cannot say that, in context, it
crossed the line.

<P20>[&para;40] Finally, the prosecutor
did not impermissibly enlist the jury to
help protect minors. The prosecutor said:

<B22>[O]ne of the things we want to emphasize
again is that sexual abuse of a minor
means that in this case [the victim]
was 15 and the person who was having
sex with her was more than ten years
older. Whether she consented or not is
absolutely irrelevant.... [T]he statute
is designed to protect younger people.
And now that you've heard the evidence,
you can understand why we have such a
law, given the facts that you've learned,
why this defendant is prohibited from
doing what he did.

<P00>DesRosiers was charged under 17-A
M.R.S. &sect; 254(1)(A), (A-2), which is titled
"Sexual abuse of minors" and requires
proof that the victim was fourteen or fifteen
years old and that the defendant was
at least ten years older than the victim.
The evidence presented at trial indicated
that the victim had sex with DesRosiers
voluntarily on the dates charged in the
indictment. Directly prior to the challenged
portion of the prosecutor's closing,
he discussed how the judge would instruct
the jury on the appropriate law and then
explained how particular testimony related
to the applicable statute. The prosecutor's
argument did not appeal to the jury's emotions
or enlist the jury to protect minors.
Instead, the prosecutor explained why testimony
establishing that the sex was voluntary
does not require acquittal, which is an
accurate statement of the law. <EM>See</EM> 17-A
M.R.S. &sect; 254(1)(A), (A-2). A prosecutor
may discuss the law and how it relates to
the facts presented at trial and argue why
the intersection of the two warrants a particular
outcome. <EM>See United States v. Sawyer,</EM>
443 F.2d 712, 713 (D.C. Cir. 1971)
("The prosecutor and the defense counsel
in turn must be afforded a full opportunity
to advance their competing interpretations,
and to emphasize the principles of law that
favor their respective positions."); <EM>cf. State
v. Lajoie,</EM> 2017 ME 8, &para; 23, 154 A.3d 132
(the prosecutor's argument as to the purpose
of a law was obvious error because it
was unsupported by case law, statute, legislative
history, or facts in evidence).

<HN24><EMB>3. The prosecutor erred when commenting
on DesRosiers's invocation
of his Fourth Amendment
right, but the error did not constitute
obvious error.</EMB>

<P20>[&para;41] Under the United States
Constitution, prosecutors cannot comment
<Page 78>
on a defendant's invocation of a constitutional
right or encourage the jury to infer
guilt from that invocation.<fnr11> <EM>See Griffin v.
California,</EM> 380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct.
1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965) ("[T]he Fifth
Amendment, in its direct application to the
Federal Government and in its bearing on
the States by reason of the Fourteenth
Amendment, forbids either comment by
the prosecution on the accused's silence or
instructions by the court that such silence
is evidence of guilt."); <EM>United States v.
Thame,</EM> 846 F.2d 200, 206 (3d Cir. 1988)
("We also see little, if any, valid distinction
between the privilege against self-incrimination
and the privilege against unreasonable
searches and seizures which is relevant
to the propriety of the prosecutor's
argument."); <EM>United States v. Taxe,</EM> 540
F.2d 961, 969 (9th Cir. 1976) (concluding
that the "[t]he prosecutor's comments on
the Taxes' refusal to consent to a search of
their trucks was misconduct" but constituted
harmless error).<fnr12>

<P20>[&para;42] Here, the prosecutor, in his
closing, argued that "when [DesRosiers]
was pressed on the matter, he says, well
you need a warrant to get in here. What's
the implication of that?" As conceded by
the State at oral argument, this statement
was prosecutorial error. Hence, the question
before us is whether it constituted
obvious error. We conclude that it did not.

<P20>[&para;43] The prosecutor made an isolated
comment while recounting the evidence
presented at trial in an otherwise
unobjectionable manner. The jury heard
DesRosiers on video deny the trooper consent
to search the camper, followed fifty
seconds later by DesRosiers telling the
victim to leave the camper, then claiming
to the trooper that she must have run out
a window. That claim was proven false
three minutes later when the trooper entered
the camper because he heard DesRosiers
yelling at the victim. The gravamen
of DesRosiers's defense was that
there was insufficient evidence that he had
sex with the victim. The victim testified
that they had had sex multiple times, and
the events observed by the trooper at the
camper supported her testimony along
with testimony from DesRosiers's acquaintance
that DesRosiers had admitted that
he had had sex with the victim. The prosecutor's
<Page 79>
comment regarding DesRosiers's
invocation of his Fourth Amendment right,
which DesRosiers made within a flurry of
inconsistent statements, while highly inappropriate,
did not undermine the integrity
of the proceedings, nor did it affect the
verdict.<fnr13> This conclusion is further supported
by the court's instructions, which
limited the potential for the erroneous
comment to contribute to the verdict. Before
closing arguments, the court instructed
the jury that the arguments from counsel
"are not evidence, but they should be
helpful to you in evaluating the evidence
you have seen and heard." In addition, in
its standard jury instructions after closing
arguments, the court said, "I'm going to
talk about what is not evidence and then
what is evidence. What is not evidence, as
we've discussed a couple of times, opening
statements, closing arguments."

<P20>The entry is:

<P20>Judgment affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt1> The victim also testified at trial that she
specifically told DesRosiers that she was fifteen.

<fnt2> The victim referenced the Facebook messages
between DesRosiers and the victim during
her testimony, describing how she told
him that she was having her period, and she
was confused by his response when he said
that whether she was on her period was irrelevant
because they were just friends. She testified
that his response surprised her because
they were having sex.

<fnt3> In <EM>Dube,</EM> we stated:

<B22>It is well established that `[d]uring closing
argument, the State may appeal to the
jury's common sense and experience without
crossing the line into prohibited argument.'
We have held that a trial court's
instruction that `[r]easonable doubt is ... a
doubt based on reason and common sense'
did not impermissibly dilute the State's burden
of proof because that instruction
`served only to emphasize that the jury
should bring good judgment to bear on its
deliberations.'

<P00><EM>State v. Dube,</EM> 2016 ME 50, &para; 17, 136 A.3d 93
(citations omitted).

<fnt4> The First Circuit stated:

<B22>When assessing sufficiency challenges in
criminal cases, we have remarked, time and
again, that factfinders may draw reasonable
inferences from the evidence based on
shared perceptions and understandings of
the habits, practices, and inclinations of
human beings. Thus, jurors are neither required
to divorce themselves from their
common sense nor to abandon the dictates
of mature experience. <EM>See ... United States
v. Ingraham,</EM> 832 F.2d 229, 240 (1st Cir.
1987) ("The law is not so struthious as to
compel a criminal jury to ignore that which
is perfectly obvious.").

<P00><EM>United States v. Ortiz,</EM> 966 F.2d 707, 712 (1st
Cir. 1992) (citation omitted).

<fnt5> Factors that have been cited elsewhere to
support a conclusion in a criminal prosecution
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
the victim and the defendant were not married
in the absence of direct evidence include
living arrangements, the victim's age and
school attendance, and the victim's actions
immediately following the incident. <EM>See generally
State v. Pitre,</EM> 893 So. 2d 1009, 1013-16
(La. Ct. App. 2005) (discussing that circumstantial
evidence, such as the youth of the
victim, where she was living, the role her
mother played in her life, her child-like appearance
at trial, and contact with the child
protection agency supported the finding that
the victim and the defendant were not married
and noting "the existence or non-existence
of a marital relationship between the
defendant and the victim must be based on all
the facts presented, rather than on the lack of
a single question") (quotations omitted);
<EM>Smith v. Commonwealth,</EM> No. 1902-93-1, 1995
WL 452348, at *1 (Va. Ct. App. Aug. 1, 1995)
(concluding that unmarried status was proven
by factors such as lack of co-habitation, the
defendant never telling police that he was
married to the victim but describing her as
someone "who I knew"); <EM>State v. Shuck,</EM> 34
Wash.App. 456, 661 P.2d 1020, 1021 (1983)
(determining that it was reasonable to infer
that there was no marriage when the victim
was in the ninth grade, her acquaintance with
the defendant lasted only one month, and she
had never spent the night at the defendant's
house); <EM>Salinas v. State,</EM> No. 13-11-00210-CR,
2013 WL 485805, at *2 (Tex. App. Feb. 7,
2013) (citing factors to support proof of unmarried
status such as the victim's testimony
that she felt "scared and nervous" regarding
her relationship with the defendant and she
did not tell anyone about their relationship
because she was afraid of how her parents
and the defendant would react); <EM>People v.
McMullen,</EM> 91 Ill.App.3d 184, 46 Ill.Dec. 492,
414 N.E.2d 214, 216 (1980) (sufficient circumstantial
evidence included unrebutted evidence
of the parties' dissimilar names, the
victim's youth, and the victim's attendance at
school and residence with parents); <EM>Commonwealth
v. Cole,</EM> 299 Pa.Super. 429, 445 A.2d
829, 831 (1982) (surveying case law and citing
factors such as brevity of acquaintance,
the victim's living with parents, the age disparity
between the defendant and the victim,
and the defendant's and victim's dissimilar
surnames).

<fnt6> At the time of DesRosiers's conduct, a sixteen-year-old
could obtain a marriage license
only after receiving written consent from his
or her parents and the county probate judge.
19-A M.R.S. &sect; 652(8) (2020). Therefore, the
victim would have needed consent from her
parents and the county probate judge before
she and DesRosiers could have received a
marriage license. <EM>See id.</EM> Despite DesRosiers's
theorizing (on appeal) that they could have
eloped to a different state, the victim's testimony
that she and DesRosiers had sex the
first night they met in person, combined with
the legal difficulty of DesRosiers and the victim
marrying in Maine, further supports the
verdict.

<P20>As of June 16, 2020, no marriage license
could be issued to an individual under sixteen.
P.L. 2019, ch. 535, &sect; 1 (effective June
16, 2020) (codified at 19-A M.R.S. &sect; 652(8)
(2020)) (subsequently amended in 2023 to
raise to seventeen years the minimum age at
which a person can obtain a marriage license).

<fnt7> DesRosiers concedes that there was sufficient
evidence to establish Count 6, which
alleges that on or about May 21, 2020, DesRosiers
furnished alcohol to the victim when she
was less than eighteen years old. <EM>See</EM> 28-A
M.R.S. &sect; 2081(1)(A)(2) (2024). DesRosiers
also concedes that there was sufficient evidence
as to Count 5, which alleges that on or
about May 21, 2020, DesRosiers engaged in a
sexual act with the victim when she was fourteen
or fifteen years old. <EM>See</EM> 17-A M.R.S.
&sect; 254(1)(A), (A-2) (2024).

<fnt8> Although DesRosiers also cites article I, section
6-A of the Maine Constitution to argue
that his rights were violated under state law,
that argument has been inadequately developed,
and so has been waived, and we decline
to reach his state law claim. <EM>See State v.
Norris,</EM> 2023 ME 60, &para;&para; 32-33, 302 A.3d 1;
<EM>State v. Moore,</EM> 2023 ME 18, &para; 19, 290 A.3d
533.

<fnt9> The Supreme Court views the standard of
review to be applied in this context as governed
by federal standards, whether the case
resides in federal or state court. <EM>See Chapman
v. California,</EM> 386 U.S. 18, 45-46, 87 S.Ct. 824,
17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (Harlan, J., dissenting);
<EM>see generally</EM> Daniel J. Meltzer, <EM>Harmless
Error and Constitutional Remedies,</EM> 61 U. Chi.
L. Rev. 1 (1994) (noting that under <EM>Chapman,</EM>
the federal harmless error standard must be
applied by state courts); <EM>People v. Miller,</EM> 113
P.3d 743, 748 (Colo. 2005) (explaining how
the Supreme Court does not demand a harmless
error review but only plain error review
when a claim is unpreserved); <EM>State v. Bond,</EM>
361 P.3d 104, 117-18 (Utah 2015) (same).

<fnt10> The challenged comments were:

<B24>&bull; [T]his defendant flat out told a falsehood.
And there's another word for falsehood,
and we'll use it maybe just once
or twice, but it's based upon the evidence.
He flat out lied to that trooper,
and that's based upon the evidence. It's
based upon the evidence that he was a
liar at that moment.

<B24>&bull; Now, as the evidence in this case progresses,
we not only just find out who,
we're starting to find out what type of
person he is. We also find out how it
came to be that this defendant was able
to use the circumstances of this rural
area at this time in our lives, the pandemic.
He used the &mdash; he used the fact
that [the victim] was 15 years old.

<B24>&bull; Facts are what you heard from the witness
stand. The fiction is what he told
[the] Trooper ... that night. One thing
after another was fiction. What you
heard in this courtroom was fact.

<fnt11> The invited response doctrine is one exception
to the general prohibition on prosecutors'
commenting on the invocation of a constitutional
right. <EM>See, e.g., United States v. Robinson,</EM>
485 U.S. 25, 25, 108 S.Ct. 864, 99
L.Ed.2d 23 (1988). The doctrine does not,
however, allow the prosecutor to argue that
the invocation of a constitutional right is evidence
of guilt. <EM>See id.</EM> at 34, 108 S.Ct. 864.

<fnt12> Not only does comment upon the assertion
of a right have constitutional implications, but
it is also inappropriate because as an evidentiary
matter, such an assertion is rarely probative
of guilt. As we stated in <EM>State v. Glover,</EM>
2014 ME 49, &para;&para; 11-12, 89 A.3d 1077:

<B42>The probative value of a defendant's exercise
of a constitutional right is minimal at
best. There are myriad reasons that a person,
whether innocent or not, may exercise
a constitutional right. <EM>See, e.g., United States
v. Hale,</EM> 422 U.S. 171, 177 [95 S.Ct. 2133,
45 L.Ed.2d 99] (1975); <EM>United States v. Prescott,</EM>
581 F.2d 1343, 1350-51 (9th Cir.
1978). This is especially true in the context
of the Fourth Amendment right to be free
from unreasonable government intrusions.
The Fourth Amendment protects an individual's
right `to be let alone,' which is wholly
independent from procedural concerns relating
to the ascertainment of truth.
<EM>Schneckloth [v. Bustamonte],</EM> 412 U.S.
[218,] 242 [93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854
(1973)]. Invocation of this right has no legitimate
bearing on the likelihood that a
defendant is guilty of a criminal offense.").

<B42>A defendant's refusal to consent to a
search may, in some circumstances, tend to
prove a defendant's consciousness of guilt.
However, its minimal probative value will
almost always be substantially outweighed
by the danger of unfair prejudice, rendering
it inadmissible pursuant to M.R. Evid. 403.

<fnt13> Although it is our understanding that when
the error involves a constitutional right but
there was no objection at the trial level, the
degree of probability that the record must
show as not affecting the verdict is a reasonable
probability, <EM>see United States v. Rodriguez,</EM>
735 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir. 2013), we conclude
that if certainty beyond a reasonable
doubt is required, this standard was also met.

<P20>[&para;1] Three Maine hospitals<fnr1> (the Hospitals)
appeal from a judgment of the Business
and Consumer Docket (<EM>Duddy, J.</EM>)
awarding restitution for unjust enrichment
to a healthcare consulting firm that provided
services to the Hospitals. The court
held a bench trial on the unjust enrichment
claim after a jury trial resulted in a
verdict for the Hospitals on the firm's
breach of contract claim. The Hospitals
contend that the judgment should be set
aside for several reasons, including that
the consulting firm was not entitled to
assert an unjust enrichment claim in lieu
of a quantum meruit claim for the reasonable
value of its services. We agree that
the court erred, vacate the judgment, and
<Page 83>
remand for judgment to be entered in
favor of the Hospitals.

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<HN00><EMB>A. Facts</EMB>

<P20>[&para;2] The following factual summary is
based on the evidence presented at the
jury trial, viewed in the light most favorable
to the jury's verdict. <EM>See Kezer v.
Cent. Me. Med. Ctr.,</EM> 2012 ME 54, &para; 2, 40
A.3d 955.

<P20>[&para;3] Core Finance Team Affiliates, LLC
(Core) provides consulting and data services
to hospitals. One of Core's services is
to provide hospitals with data that they
need to support their claims for reimbursement
by the federal government for
services to Medicare-eligible patients. The
two types of data relevant to this case are
"annual hourly wage" data for a range of
health care occupations (such as registered
nurse, nurse aide, and medical assistant) in
a hospital's geographic service area, and
"occupational mix survey" (OMS) data that
is used to adjust the annual hourly wage
data to reflect the hospital's mix of health
care occupations in its provision of patient
services.

<P20>[&para;4] In June 2014, the Maine Hospital
Association, Inc. (the Association), an association
of Maine hospitals, entered into a
contract for Core to provide data services
to the Hospitals. Core's services involved
making adjustments and revisions to the
Hospitals' internal data to be incorporated
in the Hospitals' reimbursement submittals
to the federal government.

<P20>[&para;5] The contract called for Core to provide
its services related to annual hourly
wage data at stated fixed costs. Regarding
OMS data, an attachment to the contract,
titled Exhibit E, stated: "[The Association]
will provide a listing of the providers who
elect to participate in the Occupational Mix
Survey review. [Core] will be responsible
for confirming the provider(s') participation
and directly bill the provider for
those services." Unlike the fixed costs for
Core's annual hourly wage services, the
stated cost for Core's OMS services was
contingent&mdash;a fee of 12.5% of the increase
in federal Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement
to the Hospitals attributable to
the OMS services. The Hospital finance
representatives with overall responsibility
for the Core contract considered Core's
proposed contingent fee for OMS data to
be unacceptable for various reasons, and
the Hospitals did not become contractually
bound to pay Core the contingent fee for
OMS services. However, the Hospitals
nevertheless provided Core with the information
that it needed to perform its OMS
services, leading Core to believe that the
Hospitals had in fact agreed to receive&mdash;
and pay the contingent fee for&mdash;the OMS
data. Core provided adjusted annual hourly
wage data and adjusted OMS data to
the Hospitals, and the Hospitals used the
data to obtain reimbursement for their
services to Medicare patients.

<P20>[&para;6] When Core demanded payment of
the 12.5% contingent fee for OMS services
called for in the contract, the Hospitals
refused to pay.

<HN00><EMB>B. Procedure</EMB>

<P20>[&para;7] On November 20, 2018, Core filed a
complaint in the Superior Court (Cumberland
County) against the Association and
the Hospitals, alleging that Core was entitled
to compensation for the OMS services.
In its complaint, Core pleaded two theories
of liability, "Breach of Contract" (Count 1)
and "Unjust Enrichment" (Count 2), and
attached a copy of the June 2014 contract
between the Association and Core. The
Hospitals answered and denied Core's allegations
on December 21, 2018. On the
same day, the matter was transferred to
the Business and Consumer Docket.
<Page 84>

<P20>[&para;8] On January 4, 2019, the Association
answered, denying Core's allegations, and
moved to compel arbitration under the
provisions of the contract between the Association
and Core. The Hospitals took no
position on the Association's motion but
denied contracting with Core for OMS services.
On March 6, 2019, the Business and
Consumer Court (<EM>Duddy, J.</EM>) entered an
order compelling arbitration only between
the Association and Core.<fnr2> The Hospitals
filed a demand for a jury trial on all issues
triable to a jury. <EM>See</EM> M.R. Civ. P. 38(b). On
June 28, 2021, the court denied the parties'
cross-motions for summary judgment on
the issue of whether the Hospitals were
liable to Core for OMS services under the
contract between Core and the Association.

<P20>[&para;9] On April 10, 2023, Core filed a
motion in limine seeking to exclude from
the jury trial any reference to the unjust
enrichment claim. It argued: "If the jury
concludes there was a contract in this case,
then the unjust enrichment claim is moot.
However, if the jury finds there was no
contract, then the unjust enrichment claim
is ripe [for] consideration by the Court."
The Hospitals opposed the motion, arguing
that "Core's claim styled as `unjust enrichment'
should be tried to the jury" because
Core "actually pled a quantum meruit
claim" triable to a jury. The Hospitals
alternatively argued that if the court were
to find that a jury trial right did not attach
to Core's unjust enrichment claim, the
court should nonetheless use the jury in an
advisory capacity to decide issues of fact
relevant to the claim. <EM>See</EM> M.R. Civ. P.
39(d).

<P20>[&para;10] On April 26, 2023, the court ordered
that any reference to the unjust
enrichment claim be excluded from the
trial. It explained:

<B42>As noted by [the Hospitals], the language
used in [Core's] Count II Unjust
Enrichment claim is susceptible to interpretation
as a claim for quantum meruit.
However, [Core] assures us all that it
has pled a claim for unjust enrichment,
and the Court will respect [Core's] interpretation
of its own Complaint. However,
the only relief available to [Core] on
Count II, if any, will be relief appropriate
to the equitable claim of unjust enrichment,
not damages as would be appropriate
to quantum meruit.

<P00>The court ultimately decided that the claim
for unjust enrichment would be decided by
the court at a bench trial. At the pre-trial
conference, the Hospitals raised the issue
again, contending that Core had pleaded a
quantum meruit claim, not an unjust enrichment
claim, and that the Hospitals
were entitled to a jury trial on that claim.
The court again responded that, despite
some ambiguity in the complaint, it would
not override Core's interpretation of its
pleading as asserting a claim for unjust
enrichment.

<HN24><EMB>1. Jury Trial on Breach of Contract</EMB>

<P20>[&para;11] The court held a four-day jury trial
on the breach of contract claim on June 5,
6, 7, and 8, 2023. It heard testimony from
current and former employees of the Hospitals,
as well as a principal of Core, Robert
(Brad) Bowman, and the vice president
of finance of the Association, David Winslow.
On the first day of trial, the Hospitals
&mdash;again emphasizing their right to a
jury trial on Core's ostensible unjust enrichment
claim&mdash;moved the court to convene
an advisory jury on that claim; Core
objected, and the court denied the motion.
<EM>See</EM> M.R. Civ. P. 39(d).

<P20>[&para;12] At the end of the trial, the court
clarified during its jury instructions that it
"determined that the engagement letter
<Page 85>
... along with all its attachments constitutes
a contract and that David Winslow of
the Maine Hospital Association was authorized
as the agent of the hospitals to
sign the engagement letter." The court
concluded that the terms of the OMS services
portion of the contract were ambiguous
as a matter of law and stated to the
jury: "[Y]ou must decide whether and how
under the terms of the contract a hospital
becomes bound to participate in the OMS
services component of the contract. You
must then determine, based on the facts as
you find them, whether Core has proven
by a preponderance of the evidence that
each of the hospitals became bound to
participate in the OMS services component
of the contract." The court also explained
that Exhibit E was ambiguous with respect
to Winslow's authority to bind the
Hospitals and provided the jury with instructions
on authority (implied and apparent)
and condition precedent. The court
stated to the jury,

<B42>Now, in this case, Core asserts that
the hospitals breached the contract by
failing to pay Core the required contingent
fee in exchange for the OMS services.
There is no dispute that the hospitals
did not pay Core a contingent fee
for performing the OMS services. If you
find that the contract bound the hospitals
to participate in the OMS services in
exchange for a contingent fee, then you
must find that the hospitals breached a
contract and consider the [damages].
However, if you determine that the contract
did not bind the hospitals to participate
in the OMS services, then you
must return a verdict for the hospitals
and not consider damages.

<P20>[&para;13] The jury verdict form consisted of
two questions to be answered as to each of
the three hospitals. The first read: "Has
Core proved to you by a preponderance of
the evidence that [the hospital] was contractually
obligated to participate in the
OMS services component of the contract?"
The jury's answer was "No" as to each
hospital. The jury therefore did not answer
the second question, which asked the jury
to state the dollar amount of the fee that
Core was entitled to be paid by each hospital.

<HN24><EMB>2. Bench Trial on Unjust Enrichment</EMB>

<P20>[&para;14] On August 24, 2023, the court held
a bench trial on the unjust enrichment
claim. On October 23, 2023, the court entered
a judgment in favor of Core, concluding
that Core established the elements of
its unjust enrichment claim by a preponderance
of the evidence. In the judgment,
the court commented on the parties' dispute
about whether Core's unjust enrichment
claim should have been "pleaded" in
quantum meruit. The court noted that
Core had insisted throughout the proceedings
that it did not intend to pursue a
claim for quantum meruit. The court held
that because the Hospitals did not plead
quantum meruit as an affirmative defense,
the issue of whether quantum meruit was
the appropriate theory of recovery was
waived.

<P20>[&para;15] On Core's unjust enrichment claim,
the court awarded Core a total of
$566,582.25, allocated among the Hospitals,
based on the amount by which each hospital's
reimbursement for Medicaid and
Medicare patient services had increased as
a result of the OMS data that Core had
provided. In calculating the award, the
court initially found that the Hospitals received
$3,777,215 more in federal reimbursement
during federal fiscal years 2016,
2017, and 2018 than they would have without
Core's OMS services. Based on testimony
given at the bench trial about typical
fees for OMS services, the court multiplied
the increase by 15%, rather than the 12.5%
<Page 86>
contingent fee that the proposed contract
contemplated for OMS services.

<P20>[&para;16] The Hospitals filed a timely appeal.
<EM>See</EM> M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(1); 14 M.R.S.
&sect; 1851 (2024).

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<P20>[&para;17] We review de novo the court's
legal analysis and its application of law to
facts. <EM>Atl. Home Sols., Inc. v. Pham,</EM> 2022
ME 6, &para; 8, 267 A.3d 1106.

<P20>[&para;18] The parties frame the central issue
as whether the court should have considered
Core's unjust enrichment claim in the
absence of a claim for quantum meruit.
The Hospitals argue that the trial court
lacked the authority to hear the equitable
unjust enrichment claim because Core did
not exhaust its legal remedies by pursuing
a quantum meruit claim. Core contends
that unjust enrichment was the appropriate
remedy given the jury verdict on its
express contract claim and that the Hospitals
have waived objection to the unjust
enrichment claim by failing to plead quantum
meruit as an affirmative defense.

<HN02><EMB>A. Quantum Meruit and Unjust Enrichment
Compared and Contrasted</EMB>

<P20>[&para;19] "<EM>Quantum meruit,</EM> also
sometimes labelled a contract `implied in
fact,' involves recovery for services or materials
provided under an implied contract."
<EM>Paffhausen v. Balano,</EM> 1998 ME 47,
&para; 6, 708 A.2d 269; <EM>see Runnells v. Quinn,</EM>
2006 ME 7, &para; 10, 890 A.2d 713. "A contract
`implied in fact' is a true contract that
arises from the tacit agreement of the

Contracts</EM> &sect; 1.20 at 85 (2018), and is "inferred
from the conduct of the parties."
<EM>Runnells,</EM> 2006 ME 7, &para; 10, 890 A.2d 713.
"To sustain a claim in quantum meruit, a

of the defendant; and (3) under circumstances
that make it reasonable for the

v. Passamaquoddy Tribe,</EM> 2000 ME
195, &para; 11, 760 A.2d 1041 (quotation marks
omitted). A claim for quantum meruit can
co-exist with an express contract when the
express contract does not encompass the
services that are the basis of the quantum
meruit claim. <EM>See Runnells,</EM> 2006 ME 7,
&para;&para; 8-11, 890 A.2d 713.

<P20>[&para;20] "Unjust enrichment describes
recovery for the value of the benefit
retained when there is no contractual
relationship, but when, on the grounds of
fairness and justice, the law compels performance
of a legal and moral duty to
pay." <EM>Paffhausen,</EM> 1998 ME 47, &para; 6, 708
A.2d 269.

<P20>[&para;21] "[T]he distinction between
`unjust enrichment' and `quantum meruit'
is legally significant. <EM>Quantum meruit</EM> involves
recovery for services or materials
provided under an implied contract.... In
an unjust enrichment case, the court must
decide what constitutes the inequitable retention
of a benefit by the defendant. The
damages analysis is based on principles of
equity, not contract." <EM>Aladdin Elec. Assocs.
v. Town of Old Orchard Beach,</EM> 645
A.2d 1142, 1145 (Me. 1994). Because quantum
meruit sounds in contract and unjust
enrichment is rooted in equity, we have
classified quantum meruit as a legal remedy
and unjust enrichment as an equitable
remedy. <EM>Cummings v. Bean,</EM> 2004 ME 93,
&para; 9, 853 A.2d 221.<fnr3>
<Page 87>

<P20>[&para;22] The Restatement presents a useful
comparison of quantum meruit and unjust
enrichment:

<B42>In modern practice, a claim styled
"quantum meruit" typically seeks compensation
for services rendered in the
expectation of payment, but in the absence
of explicit agreement as to
amount. Based on the circumstances of
the transaction, it may be appropriate to
find an implied promise by the defendant
to compensate the plaintiff&mdash;usually
at the customary wage or "going rate"
for the work done. If so, the measure of
the plaintiff's contractual expectation is
described by the words "quantum meruit"
(or "as much as he is entitled to"),
but the defendant's obligation is fully
explained as a matter of contract. In
such a case it would be erroneous to
associate "quantum meruit" with a liability
in unjust enrichment, or to view the
plaintiff's action as one for restitution
rather than contract damages. Changing
the facts only slightly yields a case in
which it may be much harder to conclude
that the defendant promised to
pay a reasonable price for services received,
although the law imposes the
same obligation in the absence of agreement.

<P00>Restatement (Third) of Restitution and
Unjust Enrichment &sect; 31 cmt. e (Am. L.
Inst. 2011) (citations omitted).

<P20>[&para;23] The comparison yields two
salient conclusions. First, a claim designated
as quantum meruit sounds in contract if
the plaintiff can establish that the defendant
made an implied but enforceable
promise to pay for the plaintiff's services,
but can sound in unjust enrichment if
there was no such promise, express or
implied. Second, while "there may be a
relationship between" the value of the
plaintiff's work for purposes of quantum
meruit and the value of the benefit conferred
for purposes of unjust enrichment,
"they are not necessarily the same." <EM>Bowden
v. Grindle,</EM> 651 A.2d 347, 351 (Me.
1994).

<P20>[&para;24] Applied here, these principles
confirm that the jury verdict on
Core's claim for breach of express contract
did not end the case. Because Core benefited
the Hospitals by providing them with
OMS data that they used in seeking federal
reimbursement, there remained the
question whether Core was entitled to recover
under another theory of liability (<EM>i.e.,</EM>
quantum meruit or unjust enrichment).
There is no doubt that Core could have
presented its claim in quantum meruit.
Core's principal testified that Core expected
to be paid, and two of the Hospitals'
witnesses acknowledged that it would be
fair for Core to receive payment of some
kind, although not the contingent fee mentioned
in Exhibit E to the proposed contract.
Even if the Hospitals did not expressly
request Core's OMS services, they
plainly consented to and benefited from
the services. The court's findings that the
Hospitals "were aware Core was providing
OMS services, supplied Core with all the
necessary data and documentation, answered
Core's questions, accepted the adjustments
identified by Core, submitted
the adjustments to the Medicare contractor,
and enjoyed substantially increased
<Page 88>
Medicare payments as a direct result of
Core's work" apply as squarely to quantum
meruit as they do to unjust enrichment.
In sum, had Core designated its
claim as being for quantum meruit, there
was ample evidence to support the claim
being tried to a jury.

<HN02><EMB>B. The Primacy of Contract Over Unjust
Enrichment</EMB>

<P20>[&para;25] Distilled to its essence, the Hospitals'
argument is that, because quantum
meruit is a legal remedy and unjust enrichment
is an equitable remedy, because
Core's quantum meruit remedy was adequate,
and because equitable remedies are
available only in the absence of an adequate
legal remedy, Core could not recover
on an unjust enrichment theory without
first attempting to recover in quantum meruit.

<P20>[&para;26] Core's response is that because
there was an express contract, quantum
meruit was not an available remedy. Core
also contends that, as the trial court ruled,
the Hospitals waived their argument by
failing to plead quantum meruit as an affirmative
defense.

<P20>[&para;27] We disagree with Core on
both points. Quantum meruit is a theory of
liability and a method of measuring damages,
not an affirmative defense. <EM>See, e.g.,
InfoBridge, LLC v. Chimani, Inc.,</EM> 2020
ME 41, &para; 3, 228 A.3d 721 (considering a
complaint "alleging breach of contract,
quantum meruit, and unjust enrichment
claims"); <EM>Daniel G. Lilley L. Off., P.A. v.
Flynn,</EM> 2015 ME 134, &para; 8, 129 A.3d 936
(same); <EM>Stephan Joseph Co. v. Bowdoin
Coll.,</EM> No. CV-03-338, 2003 WL 22250338,
at *2 (Me. Super. Ct.Sept. 23, 2003) (permitting
the plaintiff to amend a complaint
to plead quantum meruit).<fnr4> The existence
of an express contract does not preclude a
quantum meruit claim if the express contract
does not cover the services that are
the subject of the quantum meruit claim,
<EM>see Runnells,</EM> 2006 ME 7, &para;&para; 8-11, 890 A.2d
713, which was precisely the case here.

<P20>[&para;28] The Hospitals' contentions
call for a more nuanced consideration.
In comparing quantum meruit and
unjust enrichment claims, <EM>Paffhausen,</EM>
1998 ME 47, &para;&para; 7-9, 708 A.2d 269; <EM>Aladdin
Elec.,</EM> 645 A.2d at 1145, we have never
stated that an unjust enrichment claim
involving the rendition of services cannot
be adjudicated until after the court has
rejected a quantum meruit claim involving
the same services. However, that premise
can be readily inferred from the combination
of our limitation on the availability of
equitable remedies if there is an adequate
legal remedy, <EM>see Keniston v. JPMorgan
Chase Bank,</EM> 2007 ME 29, &para; 9 n.6, 918 A.2d
436; <EM>Wahlcometroflex, Inc. v. Baldwin,</EM>
2010 ME 26, &para; 22, 991 A.2d 44; <EM>McIntyre
v. Plummer Assocs.,</EM> 375 A.2d 1083, 1084
(Me. 1977), and our characterization of
quantum meruit as a legal remedy and
unjust enrichment as an equitable remedy,
<EM>see Dinan v. Alpha Networks Inc.,</EM> 2013
ME 22, &para; 20, 60 A.3d 792 ("Quantum meruit
is a legal, not an equitable, remedy and
thus is distinct from the theory of unjust
enrichment." (citing <EM>Cummings,</EM> 2004 ME
93, &para; 9, 853 A.2d 221)). Our cases express
the "axiomatic" principle that an equitable
remedy will be granted only where there is
<Page 89>
not an adequate legal remedy. <EM>McIntyre,</EM>
375 A.2d at 1084. So too, a party will not
be awarded an equitable form of relief
when the party fails to timely pursue a
legal remedy available to it. <EM>Id.</EM> ("[The]
appellee had an adequate legal remedy
available to her, namely, redemption, and
... having failed to pursue that remedy
she is not entitled to the equitable relief of
specific performance."). Limiting a litigant's
access to courts of equity serves to
encourage the diligent pursuit of legal
remedies. <EM>See Kane v. Morrison,</EM> 352 Pa.
611, 44 A.2d 53, 54 (1945); <EM>In re Wife, K.,</EM>
297 A.2d 424, 425-26 (Del. Ch. 1972).

<P20>[&para;29] A different substantive reason
why a court should usually address
quantum meruit before considering unjust
enrichment is the primacy of contract over
unjust enrichment in the remedial scheme.
The Third Restatement of Restitution explains:

<B22>Considerations of both justice and efficiency
require that private transfers be
made pursuant to contract whenever
reasonably possible, and that the parties'
own definition of their respective
obligations&mdash;assuming the validity of
their agreement by all pertinent tests&mdash;
take precedence over the obligations
that the law would impose in the absence
of agreement. <EM>Restitution is accordingly
subordinate to contract as an
organizing principle of private relationships,
and the terms of an enforceable
agreement normally displace any claim
of unjust enrichment within their reach.</EM>

<P00>Restatement (Third) of Restitution and
Unjust Enrichment &sect; 2 cmt. c (emphasis
added).

<P20>[&para;30] Similarly, our precedent
calls for us to determine whether the parties
entered into an enforceable express
contract before considering claims for
quantum meruit or unjust enrichment.
<EM>Aroostook Valley R.R. Co. v. Bangor &
Aroostook R.R. Co.,</EM> 455 A.2d 431, 433 (Me.
1983) ("When two parties have agreed
upon specific and unambiguous terms of
compensation for specified services by
means of an express contract, as in the
present case, the law should be most hesitant
to imply a second contract, which
covers the same subject matter, if the
evidence does not compel an inference that
the parties intended to make one.").

<P20>[&para;31] Because quantum meruit
is based on a "true contract," albeit one
that is implied from the parties' conduct,
the same principle means that the court
need not consider unjust enrichment if
quantum meruit is an adequate remedy
under the facts that the plaintiff alleges. If
the quantum meruit remedy is not adequate,
there are circumstances, discussed
below, in which the plaintiff can pursue
unjust enrichment. <EM>See infra</EM> &para; 35. Here,
however, Core has not suggested, either in
the trial court or on appeal, that quantum
meruit would not have been an adequate
remedy.

<P20>[&para;32] We recognize that Core's repeated
insistence that its claim was for unjust
enrichment, not for quantum meruit, put
the court in a difficult position. Core was
not entitled to deprive the Hospitals of the
right to a jury trial by designating as an
equitable claim what was in substance a
legal claim. On the other hand, Core was
entitled to decide what claims it had pleaded.
<EM>See Connectu LLC v. Zuckerberg,</EM> 522
F.3d 82, 93 (1st Cir. 2008). Moreover, the
characterization of the claim ultimately
may make little difference when quantum
meruit and unjust enrichment yield the
"same recovery." Restatement (Third) of
Restitution and Unjust Enrichment &sect; 31
cmt. e ("When recovery is based on unjust
enrichment, the presumptive value to the
defendant of services the defendant has
requested is likewise a reasonable price,
<Page 90>
usually the lesser of (i) market value and
(ii) a price the defendant has expressed a
willingness to pay." (emphasis omitted));
<EM>see Bowden,</EM> 651 A.2d at 351. We need not
explore the dilemma further because, even
accepting Core's claim as a valid unjust
enrichment claim, the judgment cannot
stand.

<HN02><EMB>C. The Limits on Recovery for Unjust
Enrichment</EMB>

<P20>[&para;33] Viewed as restitution for unjust
enrichment, the court's award totaling
$566,582.25 is excessive for two reasons.

<P20>[&para;34] The first is that, when a
plaintiff asserts an unjust enrichment
claim for services rendered in reliance on
an unenforceable express contract, the
amount that the plaintiff would have been
entitled to receive under the contract sets
the ceiling on recovery for unjust enrichment.
<EM>See Aladdin Elec.,</EM> 645 A.2d at 1145-46
("The equitable concept of unjust enrichment
would not justify an award to
plaintiff in excess of what it was contractually
entitled to...." (emphasis omitted)).
The court awarded Core 15% of the
amount of increase in federal Medicaid and
Medicare reimbursement attributable to
the OMS services. The proposed contract
called for Core to receive a fee of only
12.5%.

<P20>[&para;35] The second reason is that
the award was based on the benefit the
Hospitals obtained from the federal government
as a result of Core's OMS services.
In other words, the award required
the Hospitals to disgorge a portion of what
might be called the "profit" that they realized
as a result of Core's OMS services. In
limited circumstances, a plaintiff who has a
quantum meruit claim or even a breach of
contract claim can assert that those legal
remedies are inadequate and pursue an
unjust enrichment claim for the profit realized
by the defendant, but only upon proof
that the defendant engaged in some form
of active wrongdoing. <EM>See</EM> Restatement
(Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment
&sect; 51 cmt. a ("This profit-based measure
of unjust enrichment determines recoveries
against conscious wrongdoers and
defaulting fiduciaries."); <EM>Liu v. Sec. &
Exch. Comm'n,</EM> 591 U.S. 71, 79-80, 140
S.Ct. 1936, 207 L.Ed.2d 401 (2020); <EM>see
also Oceanic Inn, Inc. v. Sloan's Cove,
LLC,</EM> 2016 ME 34, &para; 38, 133 A.3d 1021
(describing accounting as "a restitutionary
remedy based upon avoiding unjust enrichment
... [that] reaches monies owed by a
fiduciary or other wrongdoer, including
profits produced by property which in equity
and good conscience belonged to the
plaintiff" (quoting <EM>Accounting for Profits,</EM>
Black's Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009))).
But neither the jury nor the court made
any finding of conscious wrongdoing by the
Hospitals. In the absence of proof of any
wrongful conduct on the part of the Hospitals,
the appropriate measure of damages
for Core's unjust enrichment claim is the
same as it would have been had Core
designated its claim as being for quantum
meruit&mdash;"the market value of [its] uncompensated
contractual performance" independent
of the additional benefit the Hospitals
received from a third party. <EM>See</EM>
Restatement (Third) of Restitution and
Unjust Enrichment &sect; 38(2)(b); <EM>id.</EM> &sect; 31 cmt.
e ("When recovery is based on unjust enrichment,
the presumptive value to the
defendant of services the defendant has
requested is likewise a reasonable price...."
(emphasis omitted)). However, at
both trials, Core's evidence of the value of
its services was based on percentage multipliers
of the increase in federal reimbursement
received by the Hospitals as a
result of Core's OMS services. The only
evidence of the value of Core's OMS services
independent of federal reimbursement
was presented by the Hospitals, but
the court rejected the evidence as not
credible. Even if we were to remand the
<Page 91>
case for the trial court to make an award
based on the value of the benefit conferred
by Core upon the Hospitals, the record
lacks a basis for the court to make the
determination without imposing a disgorgement
not supported in the evidence.
In other words, Core failed to prove the
damages recoverable under either a quantum
meruit theory or an unjust enrichment
theory.

<P20>The entry is:

<B22>Judgment vacated. Remanded to the
Business and Consumer Docket for entry
of judgment in favor of the Hospitals.
<FN>
<fnt1> The hospitals are Maine Medical Center,
Southern Maine Health Care, and Franklin
Memorial Hospital.

<fnt2> The claim between Core and the Association
is not at issue in this appeal.

<fnt3> The Restatement differs from our precedent
in not necessarily classifying unjust enrichment
as an equitable remedy. It posits that
whether a remedy is legal or equitable depends
mainly on the nature of relief sought:
"If restitution to the claimant is accomplished
exclusively by a judgment for money, without
resort to any of the ancillary remedial devices
traditionally available in equity but not at law,
the remedy is presumptively legal.... [E]quitable
remedies may be distinguished from legal
ones because they order the defendant to
do something." Restatement (Third) of Restitution
and Unjust Enrichment &sect; 4 cmt. d (Am.
L. Inst. 2011). Because the Restatement
deems unjust enrichment a legal remedy if the
relief sought is a judgment for damages, it
states that a plaintiff pursuing an unjust enrichment
claim "need not demonstrate the
inadequacy of available remedies at law." <EM>Id.</EM>
&sect; 4(2).

<fnt4> Core's authority for its assertion that quantum
meruit is an affirmative defense is an
intermediate appeals court decision from Texas.
<EM>See Protocol Techs., Inc. v. J.B. Grand
Canyon Dairy, L.P.,</EM> 406 S.W.3d 609, 614 (Tex.
App. 2013). <EM>Protocol Technologies</EM> holds, however,
that a defendant may invoke an <EM>express
contract</EM> as an affirmative defense to a quantum
meruit claim, which is deemed equitable
under Texas law. <EM>Id.</EM> at 614 ("The existence of
an express contract is an affirmative defense
to an equitable claim of quantum meruit or
unjust enrichment.").

an office for the practice of law in
Montgomery County with his son, Douglas
Yeatman.

<CN><EM>Estate of Ben Petree</EM>

<P20>On or about July 19, 2017, Ben Petree
died testate. The decedent's daughter, Caroline
Petree Iglehart, was appointed the
personal representative of the estate. Ms.
Iglehart retained Respondent to represent
<Page 97>
her in her capacity as personal representative.
On August 25, 2017, a Petition for
Probate was filed with the Register of
Wills for Montgomery County.

<P20>On April 24, 2020, Respondent informed
Ms. Iglehart's son, Chris Iglehart, that a
deed had been signed transferring a property
in Silver Spring, Maryland (the "Silver
Spring Property") to the Katherine
Federline & Dennis Federline Special
Needs Trust. Respondent further told Mr.
Iglehart: "[P]lease send all bills for that
property to me. Upon receipt of the bills, I
will get them to the trustee ... so that the
bills can be paid and transferred to [the
trustee's] name."

<P20>On June 3, 2020, Mr. Iglehart emailed
Respondent concerning two estate-related
matters. Respondent failed to respond to
this email. On August 5, 2020, Mr. Iglehart
sent another email to Respondent, this
time attempting to obtain a status update
as to a list of open items regarding the
estate. Respondent also failed to respond
to that email. On August 13, 2020, Mr.
Iglehart sent an email to Respondent, requesting
guidance about the payment of
bills for the Silver Spring Property and
expressing frustration regarding Respondent's
lack of communication. Respondent
failed to reply to that email as well. On
August 24, 2020, Mr. Iglehart attempted to
contact Respondent by email to address
issues with the transfer of the Silver
Spring Property to the trust and Respondent's
lack of communication.<fnr2> Respondent
once again failed to reply to Mr. Iglehart.

<P20>On September 10, 2020, the Register of
Wills for Montgomery County issued a
"Show Cause Referral" to the Orphan's
Court relating to the failure of the personal
representative to file the Fourth Account
in the case of <EM>Estate of Ben Petree,</EM>
Estate No. W92388.

<P20>Mr. Iglehart sent Respondent emails on
September 28, 2020, November 9, 2020,
January 10, 2021, February 22, 2021, and
March 30, 2021.<fnr3> Respondent replied only
to the January 10 email. In that reply,
Respondent stated that he would send an
email soon regarding "next steps." However,
Respondent failed to send any such
follow-up email.

<P20>On March 3, 2021, Judge Kevin G. Hessler
issued an Order to Show Cause why
the personal representative should not be
removed for failure to file the Fourth Account.
On April 1, 2021, Judge Christopher
C. Fogelman continued the show cause
hearing "to May 4, 2021 with the stipulation
that if the Account is filed prior to the
hearing the matter shall be dismissed."
Respondent did not file the Fourth Account
prior to the May 4 hearing.

<P20>In or about April 2021, Caroline and
Chris Iglehart engaged another attorney,
Joshua Winger, to restore communications
with Respondent and address the Igleharts'
remaining estate administration
items. On April 7, 2021, Mr. Winger contacted
Respondent and Douglas Yeatman
to schedule a conference call. On April 21,
2021, Respondent and Douglas Yeatman
<Page 98>
participated in a video conference call with
the Igleharts and Mr. Winger. Following
the conference call, Mr. Iglehart thanked
Mr. Winger for "facilitat[ing] the conversation
between us and the Yeatman firm."
Mr. Winger replied: "We are glad communication
has improved between the Yeatman
firm and you, enableing [sic] the
Yeatman firm and you to resume working
toward conclusion."

<P20>On May 4, 2021, Judge Bibi M. Berry
presided over the continued show cause
hearing. Judge Berry continued the show
cause hearing to the next day, May 5,
2021, with the stipulation that if the
Fourth Account "is filed prior to the hearing
the matter shall be dismissed." On
May 4, 2021, Respondent filed a Fourth &
Final Administration Account of Caroline
Petree Iglehart, Personal Representative.
On June 16, 2021, Judge David W. Lease
approved the Fourth and Final Account.

<P20>On July 20, 2021, Douglas Yeatman advised
Mr. Iglehart to "have the accountant
prepare a 2020 return so that the beneficiaries
can deduct the excess losses on
termination on their 2021 individual income
tax returns." On August 1, 2021, Mr.
Iglehart sent Respondent and Douglas
Yeatman a copy of the draft 2020 estate
tax return so that the Yeatman firm could
review and approve the filing. Neither Respondent
nor Douglas Yeatman replied to
the August 1 email. Mr. Iglehart emailed
Respondent and Douglas Yeatman on August
28, September 5, and September 19,
2021, about the status of the review of the
2020 estate tax return. Respondent and
Douglas Yeatman failed to respond to
these emails.

<P20>In or around November 2021, Mr. Iglehart
contacted Mr. Winger to inquire
about retaining Mr. Winger's firm to take
over the work regarding the estate. On
November 4, 2021 and November 23, 2021,
Mr. Winger placed calls to the Yeatman
firm and left a voicemail message. On December
2, 2021, Mr. Winger wrote to Respondent
and Douglas Yeatman regarding
the final fiduciary income tax returns and
final distributions to legatees. Neither Respondent
nor Douglas Yeatman responded
to Mr. Winger's November calls or his
December letter.

<CN><EM>Estate of Margaret McNulty</EM>

<P20>On June 24, 2010, Margaret McNulty
executed the First Amendment of the Revocable
Trust Agreement of Margaret J.
McNulty dated March 4, 1999. The instrument
designated 12 charities as beneficiaries
to Ms. McNulty's trust, with the balance
of the trust to be distributed in equal
shares to the beneficiaries upon Ms.
McNulty's death.<fnr4>

<P20>In or around December 2013, Respondent
first contacted Priests of the Sacred
Heart to notify the organization that it was
named in Ms. McNulty's trust.<fnr5> On or
about August 15, 2014, Respondent provided
Priests of the Sacred Heart with an
initial distribution of $37,500. In the letter
accompanying the initial distribution
check, Respondent advised that he was in
the process of collecting additional assets
for Ms. McNulty's trust as well as resolving
tax issues, and that he expected to be
able to make another distribution in the
months ahead.

<P20>By letter dated November 25, 2015, Respondent
advised Reverend Peluse of
Priests of the Sacred Heart that he anticipated
making final distributions to the
beneficiaries before December 31, 2015,
<Page 99>
and that "$80,891.03 remained on hand in
the bank."

<P20>On or about July 2, 2018, Pamela Godsell,
the Mission Advancement Manager
for Priests of the Sacred Heart, called
Respondent for a status update and left a
message. Respondent returned the call
and indicated that he would try to complete
the estate in August 2018. On March
24, 2020, Respondent advised Ms. Godsell
that a final distribution would be made
within 60 days. Thereafter, Respondent
failed to provide the final distribution or
respond to requests for information that
representatives of Priests of the Sacred
Heart made on December 10, 2020, February
12, 2021, July 7, 2021, August 30, 2021,
and January 17, 2022.

<CN><EM>Bar Counsel's Investigation</EM>

<P20>On or about January 23, 2022, Ms. Iglehart
filed a complaint against Respondent
with Petitioner. By letter dated February
3, 2022, Bar Counsel requested that Respondent
provide a written response to
Ms. Iglehart's complaint. Respondent
failed to timely respond. On March 3, 2022,
Bar Counsel forwarded the February 3
correspondence to Respondent via email,
first-class mail, and certified mail, to the
primary address listed on Respondent's
Attorney Information System profile. Respondent
failed to respond in any manner.

<P20>On or about April 5, 2022, Ms. Godsell
filed a complaint against Respondent with
Petitioner. By letter dated May 12, 2022,
Bar Counsel requested that Respondent
provide a written response to Ms. Godsell's
complaint no later than May 27, 2022. Respondent
failed to respond.

<P20>On April 29, 2022, Darin Bush, an investigator
in the Office of Bar Counsel,
emailed Respondent. Respondent failed to
respond. On May 2, 2022, Mr. Bush called
Respondent's law office and left a message
with the receptionist. On May 11, 2022,
Respondent returned Mr. Bush's telephone
call and stated that he was unaware
of Bar Counsel's investigation, having not
received any of Bar Counsel's emails or
mail. Respondent stated that his firm's
email system was corrupted and requested
that further communication be directed to
Douglas Yeatman's email address.

<P20>On May 23, 2022, Bar Counsel sent another
letter concerning the Petree matter
to Respondent via Douglas Yeatman's
email address and by facsimile, requesting
a response to the complaint and an explanation
for his failure to respond to the
letters dated February 3, 2022 and March
3, 2022. Respondent failed to respond. On
July 6, 2022, Bar Counsel forwarded correspondence
to Respondent regarding the
McNulty matter, requesting a written response
to the complaint, a complete copy
of the client file, including all communications,
and the jurisdiction and estate number
for the McNulty matter.

<P20>On July 14, 2022, Mr. Bush met with
Respondent at his law office and provided
him with copies of Bar Counsel's prior
correspondence. On July 21, 2022, Respondent
provided his response to Ms. Godsell's
complaint. Respondent failed to explain
his lack of communication and the
delay in making the final distribution. Also
on July 21, 2022, Respondent requested an
extension to provide a response to Ms.
Iglehart's complaint. Bar Counsel granted
an extension to August 3, 2022.

<P20>On August 3, 2022, Respondent submitted
his response to the Iglehart complaint.
The response failed to address Respondent's
lack of communication with the
Igleharts. By letters dated August 25,
2022, Bar Counsel requested that Respondent
provide the client files for the Petree
and McNulty matters. On September 20,
2022, having received no response from
Respondent to the client file requests, Bar
Counsel sent Respondent two more letters
<Page 100>
requesting the client files, as well as explanations
for his failure to timely respond to
Bar Counsel's August 25 letters. Respondent
failed to respond to either of the
September 20 letters.

<P20>On November 22, 2022, Mr. Bush met
with Respondent and Douglas Yeatman at
the Yeatmans' office. At the meeting, Respondent
and Douglas Yeatman told Mr.
Bush that Respondent would retire effective
January 1, 2023.

<P20>On January 6, 2023, Bar Counsel attempted
to contact Respondent at his law
firm via telephone, but no one answered.
Bar Counsel then called Douglas Yeatman's
cell phone number and left him a
voicemail, requesting that Respondent return
the phone call to discuss Respondent's
retirement status. Douglas Yeatman
did not return the phone call.

<P20>On January 26, 2023, Bar Counsel forwarded
correspondence to Douglas Yeatman
via first-class and certified mail in an
attempt to reach Respondent. Douglas
Yeatman did not respond. On February 14
and 15, 2023, Mr. Bush called Douglas
Yeatman's cell phone number and requested
that Douglas Yeatman return his phone
call. Neither Respondent nor Douglas
Yeatman returned the call.

<P20>On or about February 16, 2023, Mr.
Bush emailed both Respondent and Douglas
Yeatman, requesting that they contact
him. Neither Respondent nor Douglas
Yeatman did so. By letter dated February
23, 2023, Bar Counsel forwarded correspondence
to both Respondent and
Douglas Yeatman via first-class mail and
certified mail to their home addresses, requesting
that they contact Mr. Bush. The
green card accompanying the certified
mailing to Respondent was returned
signed, but neither Respondent nor Douglas
Yeatman contacted Mr. Bush.

<CN><EMB>II</EMB>

<CN><EMB>Proceedings Before the Hearing Judge</EMB>

<P20>Petitioner served Respondent with the
PDRA on April 2, 2024. Respondent did
not file an answer to the PDRA, prompting
Petitioner to file a motion for order of
default on April 19, 2024. On May 1, 2024,
the hearing judge issued an Order of Default
against Respondent, which stated
that it was:

<B42>ORDERED, that an Order of Default
be entered against the Respondent ...
for failure to respond to the [PDRA]
within the time permitted ...; and it is
further

<B42>ORDERED, that the Clerk shall issue
a notice to the Respondent at his last
known address informing him that the
Order of Default has been entered and
that he may move to vacate the Order
within thirty (30) days after entry; and it
is further

<B42>ORDERED, that a hearing shall be
held in this matter on June 11, 2024 at
9:00 a.m., at which time the Petitioner
shall be permitted to present such evidence
as it deems necessary to allow the
[hearing judge] to carry out her assigned
function as set forth in Maryland
Rule 19-727.

<P00>Respondent did not subsequently file a
motion to vacate the Order of Default.

<P20>On May 20, 2024, Petitioner filed a motion
for sanctions, based on Respondent's
failure to respond to various discovery requests.
Respondent failed to respond to
the motion for sanctions.

<P20>The evidentiary hearing went forward as
scheduled on June 11, 2024. Respondent
appeared at the hearing, accompanied by
Douglas Yeatman. Although Douglas Yeatman
did not enter an appearance in the
Circuit Court to represent Respondent,
the hearing judge allowed Douglas Yeatman
<Page 101>
to assist Respondent, who was having
difficulty hearing the proceedings.

<P20>The hearing judge orally granted Petitioner's
motion for sanctions for the discovery
violations, ordered the averments in
the PDRA deemed admitted, and precluded
Respondent from calling any witnesses
or presenting any documents at the hearing.
However, the hearing judge permitted
Respondent to testify for purposes of establishing
mitigating factors. Petitioner introduced
22 exhibits. Respondent and
Douglas Yeatman both provided unsworn
oral statements to the hearing judge,
which the judge construed as evidentiary
submissions with respect to mitigation. Respondent
stated that, at the time the complaints
against him were filed with Petitioner,
a representative of the Office of
Bar Counsel told Respondent that, if he
were to retire, the matter "would go
away." Respondent further told the hearing
judge: "[A]bout a week ago we sent
formal papers to the [Supreme Court of
Maryland] that I had retired. And I have
not been practicing law for the last two
years. I have been completely retired."
Douglas Yeatman stated that Respondent
had not practiced law for three years.
When the hearing judge asked about Respondent's
precise date of retirement,
Douglas Yeatman stated that Respondent
"didn't know he had to submit something,"
but claimed that he was to blame, not
Respondent, for the failure to submit the
necessary documentation of Respondent's
retirement at the time Respondent
stopped practicing law.<fnr6>

<P20>When the hearing judge asked why Respondent
had not responded to the PDRA
and, in particular, had not raised Bar
Counsel's purported promise to make the
complaint "go away" if Respondent retired,
Douglas Yeatman said he had thought the
Office of Bar Counsel "would have kept
their word."

<P20>In his remarks to the hearing judge,
Respondent did not mention the McNulty
matter. With respect to the Petree matter,
Respondent told the hearing judge that
the Petree estate

<B22>was settled a long time ago, approved by
the Court in every way. And the only
time we got a compliant [sic] was after it
was all filed, after everything was completed,
and that was because the personal
representative and her son didn't
want to turn the money over to the
trustee named in the will. And that &mdash;
there's nothing more we could have done
in that estate. We completed it. We were
awarded a fee of $40,000, which has
never been paid. And there is nothing
more we could do with that estate because
they didn't want to turn the funds
over to the trustee for fear that it would
just be all spent by the time the life
tenant passed away. And there was
nothing more that we could do about
that because that's what the will said to
do.

<B22>So I don't know what else could be done
or we could have done with that estate.
It took over three years; it took a long
time. It was very complicated. There
was a caveat filed. There were a couple
of houses that had to be vacated and one
was uninhabitable. It was pretty complicated.
But in any event, we handled the
estate, I think, very well. And ... the
complaint that was filed came from out
of the blue because we never received
any information from them that said
they were complaining. As a matter of
fact, they consented to the fees.
<Page 102>

<CN><EMB>III</EMB>

<CN><EMB>The Hearing Judge's Conclusions
of Law</EMB>

<P20>The hearing judge found that clear and
convincing evidence supported the conclusion
that Respondent violated several rules
of professional conduct, as detailed below.

<CN><EM>Rule 1.1 &mdash; Competence</EM>

<P20>The hearing judge concluded that Respondent
violated Rule 1.1 by: (1) mishandling
several aspects of the administration
of the Ben Petree estate; and (2) failing to
administer the Margaret McNulty trust
properly, <EM>i.e.,</EM> by neglecting one of the
beneficiaries of the trust. With respect to
the Petree estate matter, the hearing
judge explained that Respondent's failure
to file a Fourth Account &mdash; and thereby
comply with the deadlines established under
section 7-305 of the Estates and Trusts
Article &mdash; led the Register of Wills for
Montgomery County to issue a show cause
referral on September 10, 2020. The hearing
judge further concluded that Respondent
could have, but failed to, request an
extension of time to prevent court intervention.
During the initial show cause
hearing on April 1, 2021, because Respondent
had not yet completed a Fourth Account,
the court continued the hearing until
May 4, 2021, giving Respondent more
than 30 additional days to complete the
account. It was only after the court continued
the hearing one additional day to May
5, 2021, that Respondent filed the Fourth
and Final Account.

<P20>In addition, the hearing judge observed
that on April 24, 2020, Respondent directed
the Igleharts to send all the bills for the
Silver Spring Property to him so that he
could provide them to the trustee for payment.
However, Respondent waited more
than a year to provide the trustee with the
necessary information. The hearing judge
concluded that Respondent's delay "created
confusion for the Igleharts, who would
forward the bills to the Respondent upon
receipt as directed, only to learn later that
none of the bills were being paid."

<P20>With respect to the McNulty trust, the
hearing judge observed that, upon making
the initial distribution of $37,500 to Priests
of the Sacred Heart on August 15, 2014,
Respondent advised that there were additional
tasks that needed to be performed,
but that in the coming months, he expected
to be able to make another distribution.
The hearing judge found that Respondent
"allowed sixteen months to pass before
providing another update[.]" Respondent
then told Priests of the Sacred Heart that
he anticipated making the final distribution
before December 31, 2015. After that communication,
the hearing judge found, Respondent
"allowed an additional two-and-a-half
years to pass before providing an
update on the status of the final disbursement."
Respondent did not contact Priests
of the Sacred Heart again until March 24,
2020, when he advised that he would make
a final distribution within 60 days. As of
November 2022, despite attempts to contact
Respondent, Priests of the Sacred
Heart had not heard from Respondent
again or received a final distribution.

<CN><EM>Rule 1.3 &mdash; Diligence</EM>

<P20>The hearing judge concluded that Respondent
violated Rule 1.3 for the reasons
stated in reference to Rules 1.1 and 1.4.

<CN><EM>Rule 1.4 &mdash; Communication</EM>

<P20>The hearing judge concluded that Respondent
violated Rule 1.4(a)(2) and (3) in
both the Petree and McNulty matters:

<B22>Between June 2020 and April 2021, the
Respondent failed to communicate with
Ms. Iglehart or her son despite persistent
and varied attempts to reach him
and his son, [Douglas] Yeatman.... The
significance of the communication failure
<Page 103>
was such that the Igleharts had to seek
assistance from another attorney to contact
the Respondent.... Ultimately the
attorney assisting the Igleharts arranged
a video conference call whereby
communication between the Respondent
and the Igleharts was restored, albeit
temporarily until July 20, 2021, the final
date the Igleharts received communication
from Respondent....

<B22>While the Respondent administered the
estate of Ms. McNulty, he ceased communicating
with one of Ms. McNulty's
beneficiaries altogether. After a March
24, 2020, phone call, the Respondent
stopped communicating with anyone at
Priests of the Sacred Heart despite continuing
requests for further information
about a final distribution which was believed
to be forthcoming.

<CN><EM>Rule 8.1 &mdash; Bar Admission and
Disciplinary Matters</EM>

<P20>The hearing judge concluded that Respondent
violated Rule 8.1(b) by failing to
respond to Bar Counsel's letters and by
failing to provide documents requested by
Bar Counsel during the investigations Bar
Counsel conducted in response to the two
complaints filed against Respondent.

<CN><EM>Rule 8.4 &mdash; Misconduct</EM>

<P20>The hearing judge concluded that Respondent
violated Rule 8.4(a) because he
violated several other rules of professional
conduct. The hearing judge also concluded
that "Respondent's conduct was prejudicial
to the administration of justice and brings
the legal profession into disrepute in violation
of Rule 8.4(d)."

<CN><EM>Mitigating Factors</EM>

<P20>With respect to mitigating factors, the
hearing judge found that Respondent does
not have any prior discipline on his record.
The hearing judge also found that Respondent
is unlikely to commit additional misconduct,
based on his statements at the
hearing that he is retired, that he had not
engaged in the practice of law for the prior
two years, and that he does not intend to
practice law again.

<CN><EM>Aggravating Factors</EM>

<P20>The hearing judge concluded that Petitioner
established the existence of three
aggravating factors: (1) multiple violations
of the rules of professional conduct; (2) bad
faith obstruction of the attorney discipline
proceeding; and (3) substantial experience
in the practice of law:

<B22>The evidence establishes that Respondent
committed multiple offenses in administering
the estates of Ben Petree
and Margaret McNulty as well as
throughout the duration of Bar Counsel's
investigations thereof. The Court
finds bad faith obstruction of the attorney
discipline proceeding where the Respondent
failed to reply to numerous
letters and requests by Bar Counsel to
provide his entire client file in both estate
matters. Moreover, the Respondent,
who was admitted to the Maryland Bar
in 1962, has substantial experience in
the practice of law.

<P20>However, the hearing judge concluded
that Petitioner did not prove the aggravating
factor of a pattern of misconduct. The
hearing judge reasoned that a pattern of
misconduct "requires frequent or widespread
malfeasance that the Court does
not find to be present."

<CN><EMB>IV</EMB>

<CN><EMB>Standard of Review</EMB>

<P20>"This Court has original and
complete jurisdiction in an attorney disciplinary
proceeding and conducts an independent
review of the record. The hearing
judge's findings of fact are left undisturbed
unless those findings are clearly
<Page 104>
erroneous. We review the hearing judge's
conclusions of law without deference." <EM>Attorney
Grievance Comm'n v. Hoerauf,</EM> 469
Md. 179, 207-08, 229 A.3d 802 (2020)
(cleaned up). Where, as here, neither party
files any exceptions to the hearing judge's
findings of fact, we "may treat the findings
of fact as established." Md. Rule 19-740(b)(2)(A).
This Court reviews de novo
the hearing judge's conclusions of law. Md.
Rule 19-740(b)(1).

<CN><EMB>V</EMB>

<CN><EMB>Discussion</EMB>

<P20>We opt to treat the hearing judge's
findings of fact as established under Rule
19-740(b)(2)(A). We now consider the hearing
judge's conclusions of law. For the
reasons stated below, we conclude that
clear and convincing evidence demonstrates
that Respondent violated Rules 1.1
(Competence), 1.3 (Diligence), 1.4(a)(2) and
(3) (Communication), 8.1(b) (Bar Admission
and Disciplinary Matters), and 8.4(a)
and (d) (Misconduct).

<CN><EM>Rule 1.1 (Competence)</EM>

<P20>Rule 1.1 dictates that an attorney
"shall provide competent representation to
a client. Competent representation requires
the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness
and preparation reasonably necessary
for the representation." Clear and convincing
evidence supports the hearing judge's
conclusion that Respondent violated Rule
1.1 in both the Petree and McNulty matters.

<P20>With respect to the Petree matter, Respondent's
failure to file the Fourth Account
by the deadline established under
section 7-305 of the Estates and Trusts
Article led to the issuance of a show cause
referral in September 2020 and two continued
show cause hearings until Respondent
ultimately filed the Fourth Account on
May 4, 2021.

<P20>Respondent also violated Rule 1.1 by
neglecting to timely provide the trustee
with the information necessary to pay the
bills for the Silver Spring Property. Respondent
directed the Igleharts to send all
bills for the Silver Spring Property to him
in April 2020. Although the Igleharts did
as Respondent instructed, Respondent
waited more than a year to provide the
bills and associated account information to
the trustee. As the hearing judge found,
Respondent's delay created confusion for
the Igleharts, who repeatedly had to forward
unpaid Pepco bills to Respondent.

<P20>In the McNulty matter, Respondent's
violation of Rule 1.1 concerns his failure to
provide Priests of the Sacred Heart with a
final distribution. Respondent notified the
organization of Ms. McNulty's bequest in
December 2013 and provided an initial distribution
of $37,500 in August 2014. On
several occasions over the following six
years, Respondent told representatives of
Priests of the Sacred Heart that a final
distribution would be forthcoming. However,
as of November 2022, despite attempts
to contact Respondent, Priests of the Sacred
Heart had not heard again from Respondent
or received a final distribution.

<CN><EM>Rule 1.3 (Diligence)</EM>

<P20>Rule 1.3 requires attorneys to
"act with reasonable diligence and promptness
in representing a client." "The Rule
can be violated by failing to advance the
client's cause or endeavor[.]" <EM>Attorney
Grievance Comm'n v. Bah,</EM> 468 Md. 179,
208, 226 A.3d 912 (2020) (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted). "The same
rationale that supports a Rule [1.1] violation
can support a Rule [1.3] violation." <EM>Id.</EM>
at 209, 226 A.3d 912.

<P20>We agree with the hearing judge
that Respondent violated Rule 1.3 in the
<Page 105>
Petree and McNulty matters for the reasons
stated in reference to Rules 1.1 and
1.4.

<CN><EM>Rule 1.4 (Communication)</EM>

<P20>Rule 1.4 provides, in pertinent part:

<B22>(a) An attorney shall:

<B22>...

<B22>(2) keep the client reasonably informed
about the status of the matter; [and]

<B22>(3) promptly comply with reasonable requests
for information[.]

<P20>An attorney violates Rule 1.4
when "a client tries repeatedly to contact
the attorney, but the attorney fails to respond."
<EM>Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.
Hamilton,</EM> 444 Md. 163, 185, 118 A.3d 958
(2015). It is also a violation of Rule 1.4
when "an attorney fails to communicate
crucial information about the status of the
case." <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>We agree with the hearing judge's
conclusion that Respondent violated Rule
1.4(a)(2) and (3) in the Petree and McNulty
matters. Respondent's failure to respond
to the Igleharts' continued attempts
for an update on outstanding tasks, and
their requests for information between
June 2020 and April 2021, led to the Igleharts
seeking assistance from another attorney
to restore communication with Respondent.
Following a video conference
call on April 21, 2021, communication between
Respondent and the Igleharts was
temporarily restored. However, July 20,
2021 was the last time the Igleharts received
any communication from Respondent.

<P20>Respondent violated 1.4(a)(2) and (3) in
the McNulty matter when he ceased communicating
with anyone at Priests of the
Sacred Heart following a March 24, 2020
phone call, despite continuing requests
from Priests of the Sacred Heart regarding
a final distribution that never came.
Between December 10, 2020 and January
17, 2022, representatives of Priests of the
Sacred Heart made five attempts to contact
Respondent, all to no avail.

<CN><EM>Rule 8.1 (Bar Admission and
Disciplinary Matters)</EM>

<P20>Rule 8.1 provides, in pertinent part:

<B22>An applicant for admission or reinstatement
to the bar, or an attorney in connection
with a bar admission application
or in connection with a disciplinary matter,
shall not:

<B22>...

<B22>(b) fail to disclose a fact necessary to
correct a misapprehension known by the
person to have arisen in the matter, or
knowingly fail to respond to a lawful
demand for information from an admissions
or disciplinary authority, except
that this Rule does not require disclosure
of information otherwise protected
by Rule 19-301.6 (1.6).

<P20>We agree with the hearing judge
that Respondent violated Rule 8.1(b) in the
Petree and McNulty matters by failing to
respond to several letters from Bar Counsel
and by failing to provide a copy of the
client file in both matters.

<CN><EM>Rule 8.4 (Misconduct)</EM>

<P20>Rule 8.4 provides, in relevant part:

<B22>It is professional misconduct for an attorney
to:

<B22>(a) violate or attempt to violate the Maryland
Attorneys' Rules of Professional
Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another
to do so, or do so through the acts
of another; [or]

<B22>...

<B22>(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial
to the administration of justice[.]

<P20>An attorney violates Rule
8.4(a) if they violate any other rule of
<Page 106>
professional conduct. <EM>Hoerauf,</EM> 469 Md. at
214, 229 A.3d 802. "Generally, an attorney
violates [Rule 8.4(d)] when an attorney's
conduct impacts negatively the public's
perception or efficacy of the courts or legal
profession." <EM>Id.</EM> at 214-15, 229 A.3d 802
(cleaned up).

<P20>Having violated several other
rules of professional conduct, Respondent
violated Rule 8.4(a). <EM>Id.</EM> at 215, 229 A.3d
802. And we agree with the hearing judge
that Respondent's conduct in the Petree
and McNulty matters was prejudicial to
the administration of justice and brings
the legal profession into disrepute, in violation
of Rule 8.4(d).

<CN><EM>Aggravating Factors</EM>

<P20>We have listed pertinent aggravating
factors in an attorney grievance case as
including:

<B22>(1) prior attorney discipline; (2) a dishonest
or selfish motive; (3) a pattern of
misconduct; (4) multiple violations of the
[Rules of Professional Conduct]; (5) bad
faith obstruction of the attorney discipline
proceeding by intentionally failing
to comply with the Maryland Rules or
orders of this Court or the hearing
judge; (6) submission of false evidence,
false statements, or other deceptive
practices during the attorney discipline
proceeding; (7) a refusal to acknowledge
the misconduct's wrongful nature; (8)
the victim's vulnerability; (9) substantial
experience in the practice of law; (10)
indifference to making restitution or rectifying
the misconduct's consequences;
(11) illegal conduct, including that involving
the use of controlled substances;
and (12) likelihood of repetition of the
misconduct.

<P00><EM>Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. Sperling,</EM>
459 Md. 194, 275, 185 A.3d 76 (2018) (citation
omitted).

<P20>The hearing judge found the existence of
three aggravating factors: (1) multiple violations;
(2) bad faith obstruction of the
disciplinary proceeding; and (3) substantial
experience in the practice of law. Petitioner
excepts to the hearing judge's failure to
find the aggravating factor of a pattern of
misconduct.

<P20>We agree that the three aggravating
factors found by the hearing judge have
been established by clear and convincing
evidence. We sustain Petitioner's exception
to the failure to find the aggravating factor
of a pattern of misconduct. In addition, we
conclude that another aggravating factor is
present: failure to acknowledge the wrongful
nature of the misconduct.

<P20>As our discussion above demonstrates,
Respondent committed <EM>multiple
violations</EM> of the Rules of Professional
Conduct in the Petree and McNulty matters.
Respondent engaged <EM>in bad faith obstruction
of the disciplinary proceedings</EM>
by failing to respond to several letters
from Bar Counsel and requests by Bar
Counsel to provide his client files in both
matters.

<P20>Respondent displayed a <EM>pattern of
misconduct</EM> by committing multiple, similar
violations over time in two separate
matters. <EM>See Sperling,</EM> 459 Md. at 276, 185
A.3d 76 (aggravating factor of pattern of
misconduct "applies when an attorney's behavior
shows a pattern of inappropriate
conduct, as evinced by multiple violations
over time, or a series of acts with one
goal"). Respondent failed to communicate
both with the Igleharts in connection with
the Petree matter and with Priests of the
Sacred Heart in connection with the
McNulty matter. In addition, Respondent
failed to take basic steps to competently
handle both matters. Finally, Respondent
repeatedly failed to timely respond to Bar
Counsel's letters and requests for documents
in connection with the investigations
<Page 107>
of both matters. Based on this record, we
conclude that Petitioner proved a pattern
of misconduct by clear and convincing evidence.

<P20>In addition, based on our independent
review of the record and oral argument
in this Court, we conclude by clear
and convincing evidence that Respondent
has <EM>failed to acknowledge the wrongful
nature of his misconduct.</EM> Before the hearing
judge, Respondent expressed no remorse
for, or even acknowledged, his failure
to communicate for long stretches of
time with the Igleharts and Priests of the
Sacred Heart. <EM>See Attorney Grievance
Comm'n v. Sloane,</EM> 483 Md. 131, 166, 290
A.3d 1026 (2023) (aggravating factor present
where "[t]here is not a single instance
in the record where Respondent acknowledges
his improper behavior"). Indeed, Respondent
seemingly blamed the problems
in the attorney-client relationship on the
Igleharts and their alleged displeasure
with the terms of the will. <EM>See Attorney
Grievance Comm'n v. White,</EM> 480 Md. 319,
387-88, 280 A.3d 722 (2022) (sustaining
hearing judge's finding of the aggravating
factor of refusal to acknowledge wrongful
nature of the misconduct where "the record
clearly demonstrates that Respondent
blamed others for his wrongdoing"). Although
Respondent had defaulted his opportunity
to contest the allegations in the
PDRA, he told the hearing judge that he
thought "we handled the [Petree] estate
... very well" and observed that his firm
had not been paid its fee for that representation.
He also claimed that Ms. Iglehart's
complaint "came from out of the blue,"
despite the fact that Mr. Iglehart repeatedly
expressed his frustration to Respondent
about Respondent's failure to
communicate and to ensure that the trustee
had the information he needed to pay
the bills for the Silver Spring Property.
Indeed, Respondent's failures to communicate
resulted in the Igleharts having to
involve Mr. Winger, an attorney at another
law firm, on two separate occasions.<fnr7>

<P20>Finally, Respondent was admitted
to the Maryland Bar in 1962 and has <EM>substantial
experience in the practice of law.</EM>

<P20>In sum, we conclude that there are five
aggravating factors in this case: (1) a pattern
of misconduct; (2) multiple violations;
(3) bad faith obstruction of the attorney
discipline proceeding; (4) the refusal to
acknowledge the wrongful nature of the
misconduct; and (5) substantial experience
in the practice of law.

<CN><EM>Mitigating Factors</EM>

<P20>We have previously listed the following
mitigating factors:

<B22>(1) the absence of prior attorney discipline;
(2) the absence of a dishonest or
selfish motive; (3) personal or emotional
problems; (4) timely good faith efforts to
make restitution or to rectify the misconduct's
consequences; (5) full and free
disclosure to the [Attorney Grievance]
Commission or a cooperative attitude toward
the attorney discipline proceeding;
(6) inexperience in the practice of law;
(7) character or reputation; (8) a physical
disability; (9) a mental disability or
chemical dependency ...; (10) delay in
the attorney discipline proceeding; (11)
the imposition of other penalties or sanctions;
(12) remorse; (13) remoteness of
prior violations of the [Rules of Professional
Conduct]; and (14) unlikelihood of
repetition of the misconduct.
<Page 108>

<P00><EM>Sperling,</EM> 459 Md. at 277-78, 185 A.3d 76
(citation omitted).

<P20>The hearing judge concluded that
Respondent has <EM>no prior discipline</EM> on his
record. The hearing judge also found that
Respondent is <EM>unlikely to commit additional
misconduct,</EM> based on his statements
at the hearing that he is retired,
that he had not engaged in the practice of
law for the prior two years, and that he
does not intend to practice law again. We
agree that these mitigating factors are
present.<fnr8>

<CN><EMB>VI</EMB>

<CN><EMB>Sanction</EMB>

<P20>In deciding the appropriate
sanction, "we are guided by our interest in
protecting the public and the public's confidence
in the legal profession." <EM>Attorney
Grievance Comm'n v. Lewis,</EM> 437 Md. 308,
329, 85 A.3d 865 (2014) (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted). "As a result,
our purpose in deciding the appropriate
sanction is not to punish the lawyer, but to
protect the public, and deter other lawyers
from engaging in similar misconduct." <EM>Attorney
Grievance Comm'n v. Edwards,</EM> 462
Md. 642, 711, 202 A.3d 1200 (2019) (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted).
"When determining the appropriate discipline,
we consider the facts and circumstances
of each case and order a sanction
that is commensurate with the nature and
gravity of the violations and the intent
with which they were committed." <EM>Id.</EM> at
712, 202 A.3d 1200 (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted).

<P20>Bar Counsel recommends disbarment,
citing among other cases, <EM>Attorney Grievance
Comm'n v. Kremer,</EM> 432 Md. 325, 68
A.3d 862 (2013), and <EM>Attorney Grievance
Comm'n v. Park,</EM> 427 Md. 180, 46 A.3d
1153 (2012). At oral argument, when asked
to address the appropriate sanction, Douglas
Yeatman requested that we not disbar
Respondent, which he said would "ruin his
60-year ... tenure of being a Maryland
lawyer with a great reputation."

<P20>We agree with Bar Counsel that
this case in material respects resembles
<EM>Kremer, Park,</EM> and other "cases involving
flagrant neglect of client affairs, including
failure to communicate with clients or respond
to inquiries from Bar Counsel[.]"
<EM>Kremer,</EM> 432 Md. at 338, 68 A.3d 862 (quoting
<EM>Attorney Grievance Comm'n v. Lara,</EM>
418 Md. 355, 365, 14 A.3d 650 (2011)).
<EM>Kremer</EM> involved an attorney who failed to
file bankruptcy petitions for two clients,
and who had numerous hearings postponed
in two other clients' cases, leading
to the dismissal of one of those other
cases. <EM>Id.</EM> at 335, 68 A.3d 862. The attorney
also failed to communicate with the four
clients, despite many attempts by the
clients to do so. Further, the attorney
abandoned the clients' cases before completion
and failed to return unearned fees
and documents in three of the four client
matters. <EM>Id.</EM> at 336, 68 A.3d 862. In the
fourth matter, the attorney returned the
unearned fee and documents, but not in a
timely manner. <EM>Id.</EM> In addition, the attorney
failed to respond to the PDRA filed in
that case. We concluded that the attorney
violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.16(d), 8.1(b),
and 8.4(d). <EM>Id.</EM> at 335-37, 68 A.3d 862.
<Page 109>
<EM>Kremer</EM> also involved two of the aggravating
factors that are present in this case: a
pattern of misconduct and bad faith obstruction
of the disciplinary proceeding. <EM>Id.</EM>
at 340-41, 68 A.3d 862. The attorney in
<EM>Kremer</EM> established no mitigating factors.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 341, 68 A.3d 862. We concluded that
disbarment was the appropriate sanction.
<EM>Id.</EM>

<P20><EM>Park</EM> concerned an immigration attorney
who filed incomplete documents on behalf
of a client and then failed to act in a timely
manner to correct the documents after
being notified of deficiencies in them. 427
Md. at 187-88, 46 A.3d 1153. He also failed
to keep his client advised of the progress
of the applications and to respond to the
client's attempts to obtain information
about the case. <EM>Id.</EM> at 188-89, 46 A.3d 1153.
He also failed to inform the client that he
was closing his law office and did not
provide a working telephone number
where he could be contacted. <EM>Id.</EM> at 189, 46
A.3d 1153. In addition, the attorney failed
to refund the unearned portion of the
client's prepaid fee and failed to return
papers to which the client was entitled. <EM>Id.</EM>
The attorney also failed to respond to two
letters from Bar Counsel and a request by
an investigator in the Office of Bar Counsel
to schedule a meeting to discuss the
client's complaint. <EM>Id.</EM> at 190, 46 A.3d 1153.
We concluded that the attorney violated
Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a), 1.16(d), 8.1(b), and
8.4(d). <EM>Id.</EM> at 192-94, 46 A.3d 1153. We
mentioned no aggravating factors in <EM>Park,</EM>
but noted the absence of any mitigating
factors. <EM>See id.</EM> at 196, 46 A.3d 1153. We
disbarred the attorney, explaining that

<B22>disbarment is the appropriate sanction
when an attorney abandons a client by
failing to pursue the client's interests,
failing to communicate with the client,
ignoring a client's repeated requests
for status updates, terminating the representation
without notice by failing
wholly to provide effective services, and
failing to return unearned fees. [The
attorney] did all of this and failed to
cooperate with Bar Counsel's lawful demands
for information, in violation of
MLRPC 8.1.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 196, 46 A.3d 1153.

<P20>Here, Respondent violated most of the
same rules as the attorneys in <EM>Kremer</EM> and
<EM>Park.</EM> Although Respondent performed
some services of value for his clients, there
came a time when Respondent stopped
communicating with the Igleharts and
Priests of the Sacred Heart and thereby
effectively abandoned his clients, Ms. Iglehart
and the McNulty estate. Unlike in
<EM>Kremer</EM> and <EM>Park,</EM> there was no finding
here that Respondent violated Rule
1.16(d). However, more aggravating factors
are present in this case than in <EM>Kremer</EM>
and <EM>Park.</EM> In particular, as in <EM>Sloane,</EM>
Respondent's "unwillingness or inability to
appreciate his wrongful conduct is critical."
<EM>Sloane,</EM> 483 Md. at 166, 290 A.3d 1026.

<P20>We have considered that Respondent
practiced law for 60 years without receiving
any prior discipline. It is unfortunate
that Respondent ended his career as he
did. However, the aggravating factors significantly
outweigh the mitigating factors
in this case. From a client's perspective,
professional misconduct is no less problematic
at the end of a legal career than it is
at the beginning. That is our perspective
as well.

<CN><EMB>VII</EMB>

<CN><EMB>Conclusion</EMB>

<P20>For the reasons discussed above, we
conclude that Respondent violated Rules
1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a)(2) and (3), 8.1(b), and 8.4(a)
and (d). We order that Respondent be
disbarred.

<P20><EMB>IT IS SO ORDERED;</EMB>
<Page 110>

<P20><EMB>RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL
COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK
OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS
OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT
TO MARYLAND RULE 19-709 FOR
WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED
IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY
GRIEVANCE COMMISSION
AGAINST FRANCIS EDWARD YEATMAN.</EMB>
<FN>
<fnt1> Effective July 1, 2016, the Maryland Lawyers'
Rules of Professional Conduct
("MLRPC") were renamed the Maryland Attorneys'
Rules of Professional Conduct
("MARPC") and recodified without substantive
changes in Title 19 of the Maryland
Rules. In the PDRA, Petitioner cited provisions
of both the MLRPC and MARPC, presumably
because Respondent's work in connection
with one of the matters at issue began
before, and continued after, July 1, 2016. For
ease of reference, we will use the shorter
designations of the MLRPC &mdash; <EM>i.e.,</EM> Rule 1.1 in
lieu of Maryland Rule 19-301.1. <EM>See also</EM> Md.
Rule 19-300.1(22).

<fnt2> In his August 24 email to Respondent, Mr.
Iglehart said: "I just received a notice and bill
showing the Pepco electric bill for the [Silver
Spring Property] is past due.... I again restate
my concerns that it appears that the
[Silver Spring Property] has not been transferred
from the estate to the trust."

<fnt3> In his September 28, 2020 and January 10,
2021 emails to Respondent, Mr. Iglehart
again complained that he was continuing to
receive Pepco bills for the Silver Spring Property.
In the January 10 email, Mr. Iglehart
told Respondent that the Pepco bills are "obviously
not being paid ... as the balance
grows each month." The record reflects that
Mr. Iglehart sent a sixth email to Respondent
during this period of time (dated October 25,
2020). Respondent also failed to reply to that
email.

<fnt4> The hearing judge's findings referred to 11
charities, but the trust document lists 12 charities
as beneficiaries.

<fnt5> The record reflects that Ms. McNulty died in
August 2012.

<fnt6> Under Regulation i.5 of the Client Protection
Fund of the Bar of Maryland, an attorney
who wishes to change their status from active
to inactive/retired must submit a notarized
affidavit of inactive/retired status on the requisite
form.

<fnt7> In oral argument before this Court, Respondent
reiterated that his firm had done a "a
good job" in the Petree matter, had "earned a
substantial fee that has never been paid" for
that work, and that Ms. Iglehart's complaint
"came out of the blue as far as we're concerned."
He again failed to acknowledge the
wrongful nature of his conduct in any respect.

<fnt8> We note, however, that there is a difference
between simply saying one has retired from
the practice of law and actually retiring from
the practice of law. Respondent did not submit
an affidavit of inactive/retirement status
to the Client Protection Fund at the time he
claimed to have retired. We also take judicial
notice of the fact that Respondent was administratively
suspended from the practice of law
in Maryland by order of this Court dated
March 24, 2022, for failure to pay the annual
$205 assessment to the Client Protection
Fund, and that he has remained in that status
until today.

<CN>ORDER

<P20>In its petition for disciplinary or remedial
action, the Attorney Grievance Commission
alleges that in June 2023 the Virginia
State Bar Disciplinary Board revoked respondent's
license to practice law in Virginia.
Later in 2023, the District of Columbia
Court of Appeals disbarred respondent.
Upon the filing of the petition and pursuant
to Rule 19-737(c), the Court issued an
order requiring the respondent to show
cause why corresponding discipline should
not be imposed. Respondent did not respond
to the order. Because of the Respondent's
failure to file a response to the
order to show cause, Bar Counsel filed a
motion for order of default.

<P20>Upon consideration of the petition, it is
this 25th day of November 2024, by the
Supreme Court of Maryland,

<P20>ORDERED that the Respondent, Evan
Stuart Elan, is disbarred from the practice
of law in the State of Maryland effective
immediately; and it is further

<P20>ORDERED that the Clerk of this Court
shall strike the name of Evan Stuart Elan
from the register of attorneys in this
Court and certify that fact to the Trustees
of the Client Protection Fund of the Bar of
Maryland and all Clerks of all judicial
tribunals in this State in accordance with
Maryland Rule 19-761(b); and it is further

<P20>ORDERED that the motion for order of
default is denied as moot.

[MT]
<P20>In the Circuit Court for Montgomery
County, the petitioner, Shaoshan Feng,
filed a notice of appeal of the judgment of
absolute divorce entered on September 15,
2023. On February 6, 2024, the Appellate
Court issued an order commencing the 10-day
period in which Ms. Feng must order
any necessary transcripts. After the 10-day
period expired and the transcripts had
not been ordered, the Appellate Court ordered
Ms. Feng to show cause why the
appeal should not be dismissed for failure
to order the transcripts.

<P20>On May 13, 2024, Ms. Feng filed an
answer to the show cause order stating
that she included the September 8, 2023
transcript to her brief and that she "believes
it to be the only transcript necessary
for the appeal." On May 20, 2024, the
Appellate Court ordered Ms. Feng to submit
proof in writing that she ordered and
submitted payment for the transcripts of
the July 10, 11, and 12, 2023 proceedings
in the circuit court or the appeal may be
dismissed.

<P20>On June 3, 2024, Ms. Feng filed a response
to the Court's May 20, 2024 order
asking that the Court excuse the requirement
that she provide the relevant transcripts.
On June 14, 2024, the Appellate
Court again ordered Ms. Feng to submit
proof in writing that she ordered and submitted
payment for the transcripts of the
July 10, 11, and 12 proceedings or the
appeal may be dismissed.

<P20>On July 17, 2024, the Appellate Court
dismissed the appeal pursuant to Maryland
Rule 8-802(c)(4) because Ms. Feng
failed to provide the necessary transcripts.
Ms. Feng sought review in this Court by
petition for writ of certiorari.

<P20>Subsequent to the Appellate Court's dismissal
order, the Administrative Office of
the Courts has initiated a program pursuant
to which funds may be available for
preparation of transcripts in certain appeals.
It is not clear whether the program
would apply in this case.

<P20>Upon consideration of the petition, it is
this 26th day of November 2024, by the
Supreme Court of Maryland,

<P20>ORDERED that the petition is granted;
and it is further

<P20>ORDERED that the order of the Appellate
Court of Maryland dismissing the appeal
is vacated; and it is further

<P20>ORDERED that this case is remanded
to the Appellate Court for a determination
of whether the newly created program established
to provide payment for transcripts
for qualifying self-represented litigants
is able to cover the cost of the
petitioner's transcripts.

<P20>This case arises out of a custody dispute
between appellant Gina Augustine ("Mother")<fnr1>
and appellee Steven Wolf ("Father"),
who are the parents of "B.,"<fnr2> a minor child
born in 2017. As a result of a consent
order entered in March of 2018, both parents
shared joint physical and legal custody
of B. In January of 2021, following an
allegation that Father sexually abused B.
while B. was in his care, Mother filed a
petition for protection from child abuse.
The Circuit Court for Cecil County initially
issued a temporary protective order, and
on March 9, 2021, held a final protective
order hearing, in which the court declined
to conclude that Father had sexually
abused B., and therefore denied the petition.
Subsequently, Mother sought modification
of the existing custody order in the
circuit court. In response, Father filed a
motion <EM>in limine</EM> asserting that the final
protective order ruling precluded the court
from finding that Father had sexually
abused B. at any time prior to the final
protective order hearing.

<P20>Following a hearing on the motion <EM>in
limine,</EM> the circuit court determined that
the prior ruling collaterally estopped the
parties from relitigating the issue of
whether Father sexually abused B. prior
to March 9, 2021. Mother noted a timely
appeal and presents the following question
for our review:<fnr3> whether a court's denial of
a petition seeking protection from child
abuse collaterally estops future consideration
of the alleged child abuse in subsequent
custody litigation.<fnr4> For the reasons
to follow, we reverse the judgment of the
circuit court, vacate the circuit court's custody
order, and remand.

<CN><EMB>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL
BACKGROUND</EMB>

<P20>The issue of B.'s custody was first addressed
in March of 2018, when B. was
less than one year old. At that time, an
initial custody order was entered by consent
of the parties wherein Mother and
Father were granted joint legal and physical
custody of B., and vacation time and
childcare costs were apportioned between
the parents. Subsequent to the initial order
and following allegations that B. had
been sexually abused by Father, a temporary
protective order was entered in January
of 2021 that granted Mother temporary
custody of B. and directed the Cecil
County Department of Social Services
("DSS") to initiate an investigation. As
part of the ensuing investigation, B. was
interviewed by a Child Protective Services
assessor and certified forensic interviewer,
Kristen Berkowich ("Berkowich"). During
the forensic interview, B. made statements
about Father's conduct which DSS concluded
evinced sexual abuse. B., then not
<Page 125>
yet four years old, did not provide a timeline
of when the alleged abuse occurred.
The DSS investigation concluded in February
of 2021, and resulted in a finding of
"indicated" sexual abuse.

<P20>After Mother filed the petition for protection
from child abuse and the DSS investigation
terminated, the circuit court
held a final protective order hearing on
March 9, 2021 ("the 2021 hearing"). The
evidence adduced in the hearing was testimony
from Father, Mother, and Berkowich,
as well as the written DSS investigation
summary and the results of a private
polygraph examination taken by Father.
Although DSS had a recording of Berkowich's
interview with B., the court did not
review the recording.<fnr5> Nor did the court
itself interview B. Following the parties'
closing arguments, the court reviewed the
evidence, and noted that although the DSS
report indicated B. reported that Father
had anally penetrated B., "I don't think
that's substantiated by the medical examination
that has been conducted."<fnr6> The
court denied the petition, stating: "I am
unable to find that [Mother] has met the
burden. I'm not able to find by a preponderance
of the evidence that [Father] sexually
abused the minor child." Start to
finish&mdash;including preliminary motions, a
22-minute recess, and the court's oral ruling
&mdash;the 2021 hearing concluded in less
than two hours.

<P20>For more than a year following the
court's denial of the petition for protection
from child abuse, Mother continued
to allege to various healthcare providers,
educators, and government agencies that
Father had abused B. Mother's efforts included
filing a motion for a new trial,
which was denied, and seeking <EM>en banc</EM>
review in the circuit court, in which a
three-judge panel affirmed the decision of
the protective order court. Mother continued
to regularly file reports with DSS, as
did some of B.'s teachers and healthcare
providers. Eventually, between 30 to 40
reports were submitted to DSS; all but
one were either ruled out or screened out.
The sole exception was the initial 2021
"indicated" finding made after Berkowich's
forensic interview of B., which, following
the denial of Mother's petition for
a protective order in the 2021 hearing,
DSS amended and retroactively ruled
out.<fnr7>

<P20>Of relevance to this appeal, in 2022
Mother filed a petition to modify child
custody in the circuit court, in which Mother
argued that due to Father's alleged
"past and ongoing sexual abuse of [B.]
there has been a material change in circumstances[.]"
Notably, during the pendency
of the custody modification process,
a Best Interest Attorney ("BIA") was appointed
to represent B.<fnr8> As part of the
custody modification litigation, Father filed
<Page 126>
a motion <EM>in limine</EM> asserting that the
court's ruling in the 2021 protective order
hearing served to collaterally estop the
parties from arguing, or the court from
finding, that Father had abused B. prior to
March 9, 2021, the date of the protective
order hearing. Father's motion was opposed
by both Mother and the BIA.

<P20>In January of 2023, the circuit court
held a hearing to address the motion <EM>in
limine,</EM> during which the parties presented
arguments related to Father's contention
that the prior denial of Mother's protective
order petition served to preclude future
litigation related to allegations of abuse
that were made in the 2021 hearing. Following
the motions hearing, the court issued
a written memorandum opinion on
the matter. In the opinion, the court rejected
the argument that res judicata applied
to the case, as the custody modification
litigation was a distinct cause of action
from the petition for a protective order.

<P20>The court, however, accepted Father's
argument that the doctrine of collateral
estoppel served to limit arguments, evidence,
and findings in the ongoing custody
modification proceedings. The court determined
that Mother "was afforded the opportunity
to call whatever witnesses she
deemed appropriate, produce and provide
to [the previous] court whatever evidence
she deemed necessary, and to cross examine
any witnesses and attack any evidence
produced by Father[,]" and thus, "[s]he
was, in every sense, given a fair opportunity
to be heard on the issue." In conclusion,
the court determined that:

<B22>Mother is collaterally estopped from relitigating
the issue of whether Father
sexually abused [B.] prior to March 9,
2021. Inasmuch as Father seeks the suppression,
or declaration of inadmissibility,
of evidence related to allegations of
sexual abuse of [B.] by Father prior to
March 9, 2021, the court offers the following
guidance: the court will not admit
such evidence for the purpose of determining
whether Father sexually abused
[B.] prior to March 9, 2021. The determination
of whether any such evidence
is relevant for some other purpose will
have to be made at trial as that item or
testimony is sought to be introduced.

<P20>Subsequently, the court held a four-day
merits hearing on the motion to modify
custody. During that trial, the court maintained
its ruling, and the parties were
precluded from submitting evidence for
the purpose of demonstrating that Father
had abused B. prior to the date of the 2021
hearing. The court also noted that the
protective order court's declination to enter
a protective order operated as "a stop
upon the [c]ourt [from] making the contrary
finding." Accordingly, the parties
were prevented from moving to admit certain
evidence in the trial, including the
video of the forensic interview and the
testimony of an expert&mdash;Dr. Champion&mdash;
which concerned the validity and meaning
of the forensic interview. The court did
consider evidence from prior to the 2021
hearing for purposes other than to support
the contention that Father had abused B.
prior to March 9, 2021.

<P20>After the parties presented arguments
and testimony, the court determined that
it was unable to find by a preponderance
of the evidence that B. had been sexually
abused in the time frame following the
2021 hearing and stated that "the real
issue here is ... the persistent involvement
of the Department of Social Services."
The court, while noting that both
Mother and Father were sincere in their
desire to advance B.'s best interests, also
articulated its concern regarding the impact
Mother's "mental health" and "certainty
that [B.] has been abused" could
have on B.'s development and wellbeing.
After conducting an analysis of the case
<Page 127>
and relevant custody factors, the court
modified custody, granting the parties
shared physical custody and joint legal
custody, but vesting tiebreaking authority
with Father. This appeal followed.

<CN><EMB>DISCUSSION</EMB>

<HN02><EMB>I. THE CIRCUIT COURT ERRED IN CONCLUDING
THAT THE PRIOR DENIAL OF A FINAL
PROTECTIVE ORDER PRECLUDED THE ADMISSION
OF EVIDENCE RELATED TO CLAIMS
OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE IN SUBSEQUENT
CUSTODY LITIGATION.</EMB>

<HN20><EMB>A. Standard of Review</EMB>

<P20>The question of whether the doctrines
of res judicata or collateral estoppel
apply to preclude relitigation of a fact or
issue is a question of law which we review
de novo. <EM>Garrity v. Md. State Bd. of
Plumbing,</EM> 447 Md. 359, 368, 135 A.3d 452
(2016) ("Whether it was appropriate to
grant preclusive effect ... is a legal conclusion
that this Court reviews de novo.")
(italics omitted); <EM>see also Bank of New
York Mellon v. Georg,</EM> 456 Md. 616, 666,
175 A.3d 720 (2017) ("We review without
deference, however, questions of law, such
as a determination as to the applicability of
the doctrines of res judicata and collateral
estoppel.").

<HN20><EMB>B. Collateral Estoppel</EMB>

<P20>The doctrine of collateral estoppel,
alongside the related concept of res
judicata, is a form of the broader doctrine
of estoppel by judgment. <EM>Scott v. Prince
George's Cnty. Dept. of Soc. Servs.,</EM> 76 Md.
App. 357, 374, 545 A.2d 81 (1988). After an
issue has been conclusively decided in a
judicial proceeding, collateral estoppel prevents
the relitigation of that issue when
the following four-part test is satisfied: (1)
the issue decided in the prior adjudication
is identical to the one presented in the
subsequent litigation; (2) there was a final
judgment on the merits in the prior adjudication;
(3) the party against whom the
claim is asserted is either the same party
as in the prior adjudication, or is in privity
with a party to the prior adjudication; (4)
the party against whom the claim is asserted
received a fair opportunity to be
heard on the issue. <EM>See Colandrea v. Wilde
Lake Cmty. Ass'n, Inc.,</EM> 361 Md. 371, 391,
761 A.2d 899 (2000) (citing <EM>Washington
Suburban Sanitary Comm'n v. TKU Assocs.,</EM>
281 Md. 1, 18-19, 376 A.2d 505
(1977)). This doctrine, by which a fact previously
adjudicated in litigation between
the same parties is treated as conclusive in
a subsequent action between the same parties,
is "based on two principles: judicial
economy and fairness." <EM>Garrity,</EM> 447 Md.
at 368, 135 A.3d 452.<fnr9>

<HN20><EMB>C. Parties' Contentions</EMB>

<P20>Mother argues that the circuit court erroneously
concluded that the doctrine of
collateral estoppel precluded the introduction
of evidence and argument related to
concerns of sexual abuse occurring prior to
March 9, 2021. Although acknowledging
<Page 128>
that no Maryland appellate court has directly
addressed the preclusive effect of a
prior protective order hearing on subsequent
custody litigation, Mother asserts
that related Maryland caselaw intimates
that collateral estoppel does not apply to a
custody modification proceeding where a
changed circumstance is asserted.

<P20>Father contends that the circuit court
correctly applied the doctrine of collateral
estoppel when it precluded the introduction
of evidence and argument related to
concerns of sexual abuse occurring prior to
March 9, 2021. Father acknowledges the
lack of appellate precedent addressing the
preclusive effect of a prior protective order
hearing on subsequent custody litigation,
but nonetheless argues that because the
elements of collateral estoppel were met,
the doctrine should apply in this case.

<HN20><EMB>D. Legal Framework</EMB>

<CN><EM>i. Protective order hearings</EM>

<P20>We begin by examining the distinctions
between a protective order hearing
and a custody modification hearing.
Pursuant to the Family Law Article
("FL") of the Maryland Code, a protective
order can be entered when a court finds by
a preponderance of the evidence that a
person committed domestic violence, which
includes abuse of their child. <EM>See C.M. v.
J.M.,</EM> 258 Md. App. 40, 56-57, 295 A.3d 193
(2023). "A petitioner may seek relief from
abuse by filing with a court ... a petition
that alleges abuse of any person eligible
for relief by the respondent." FL &sect; 4-504(a)(1).
A person eligible for relief includes
the natural or adopted child of the
respondent. FL &sect; 4-501(m)(3). The purpose
of the statute is "to protect and aid victims
of domestic abuse by providing an immediate
and effective remedy." <EM>Coburn v. Coburn,</EM>
342 Md. 244, 252, 674 A.2d 951
(1996) (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted). A protective order under the
domestic abuse statute is not intended to
"punish[] ... past conduct" but rather to
"prevent further harm to the victim." <EM>Id.</EM>
To this end, the barriers to seeking a
protective order are relatively minimal,
and "designed to be available for <EM>pro se</EM>
applicants," with pre-printed forms accessible
in Maryland courthouses, filing fees
waivable, and preliminary <EM>ex parte</EM> hearings
available. <EM>Id.</EM> at 253-54, 674 A.2d 951.

<P20>In cases of domestic violence, the Supreme
Court of Maryland has emphasized
the importance of evidence of past abuse
as potentially predictive of future abusive
behavior. <EM>Id.</EM> at 257-58, 674 A.2d 951 (noting
that "[d]ue to the cyclical nature of
domestic violence, introduction of evidence
of the relationship's history of abuse ... is
vital in allowing a court to fully comprehend
the risk posed to a particular petitioner"
(internal quotation marks and citation
omitted)). Thus, "excluding evidence
of past abuse would violate the fundamental
purpose of the statute, which is to
prevent future abuse." <EM>Id.</EM> at 258, 674 A.2d
951. Applying these principles, this Court
recently decided that when a petition for a
protective order has been litigated, that
denial does not collaterally estop courts in
future protective order hearings from examining
evidence of abuse alleged in previous
hearings, irrespective of whether the
previous protective order petition was denied.
<EM>See Hripunovs v. Maximova,</EM> 263
Md. App. 244, 268, 322 A.3d 813 (2024).

<P20><EM>Hripunovs</EM> involved a case where a petitioner,
Maximova, alleged abuse, but was
unable to demonstrate sufficient evidence
for a court to grant her a final protective
order. <EM>Id.</EM> at 250, 322 A.3d 813. Subsequently,
Maximova filed a second petition
seeking a protective order, in which she
repeated many claims litigated in the initial
proceeding, but also alleged new instances
of abuse occurring after the denial
of her first protective order petition. <EM>Id.</EM> at
<Page 129>
250-53, 322 A.3d 813. During the second
protective order hearing, Maximova presented
a report from a forensic nurse examiner
and photographs which allegedly
depicted bruises she sustained due to the
defendant's physical abuse. <EM>Id.</EM> at 254, 322
A.3d 813. Maximova asserted that the photographs
and report pertained to abuse
she suffered prior to the first protective
order hearing, but the hospital had not
provided her with the report and photographs
in time for the first hearing. <EM>Id.</EM>
The circuit court accepted the evidence,
reasoning that "[a]lleged prior abuse is
admissible and relevant because it predicts
future abuse." <EM>Id.</EM> at 259, 322 A.3d 813
(emphasis omitted). This Court affirmed,
reasoning that as Maximova alleged new
abuse following the denial of the first protective
order, res judicata did not preclude
her second petition; nor did the doctrine of
collateral estoppel prevent her from litigating
the new allegations of abuse. <EM>Id.</EM> at
268, 322 A.3d 813. Thus, we determined
that with new instances of abuse alleged, it
was not erroneous for the trial court to
examine Maximova's past allegations and
evidence of abuse, notwithstanding that
her previous petition had been denied. <EM>Id.</EM>
This is because "`excluding evidence of
past abuse would violate the fundamental
purpose' of the domestic violence statute,
`which is to prevent future abuse.'" <EM>Id.</EM>
(quoting <EM>Coburn,</EM> 342 Md. at 258, 674 A.2d
951).

<CN><EM>ii. Custody modification hearings</EM>

<P20>In contrast to a protective order
hearing, a custody proceeding is focused
on weighing the "child's life chances
in each of the homes competing for custody
and then [] predict[ing] with whom the
child will be better off in the future."
<EM>Montgomery Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v.
Sanders,</EM> 38 Md. App. 406, 419, 381 A.2d
1154 (1978). "Unequivocally, the test with
respect to custody determinations begins
and ends with what is in the best interest
of the child." <EM>Azizova v. Suleymanov,</EM> 243
Md. App. 340, 347, 220 A.3d 389 (2019). In
crafting a custody arrangement that will
advance the best interest of a child, courts
are instructed to determine "what appears
to be in the welfare of the child[] at the
time of the [custody] hearing." <EM>Raible v.
Raible,</EM> 242 Md. 586, 594, 219 A.2d 777
(1966). However, evaluation of a parent's
past conduct is still relevant to the extent
it "is predictive of future [parental] behavior
and its effect on the child." <EM>Azizova,</EM>
243 Md. App. at 357, 220 A.3d 389. "Generally,
past conduct is raised in custody or
termination of parental rights cases where
neglect or abuse has been alleged[.]" <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>Although a custody proceeding
is typically titled as litigation between the
parents of a minor child, "children have a
substantial interest in the outcome of their
parents' custody dispute and are individuals
with rights recognized by the courts[.]"
<EM>Auclair v. Auclair,</EM> 127 Md. App. 1, 13, 730
A.2d 1260 (1999), <EM>abrogated on other
grounds by Fox v. Wills,</EM> 390 Md. 620, 890
A.2d 726 (2006). As this Court has previously
indicated, a child has "an indefeasible
right to have any custody determination
concerning [the child] made, after a
full evidentiary hearing, in [the child's]
best interest." <EM>Flynn v. May,</EM> 157 Md.
App. 389, 410, 852 A.2d 963 (2004). Similarly,
we have "long recognized that a court
commits legal error when it makes a decision
that impacts a custody determination
without first considering how that decision
will affect the child's `indefeasible right' to
have his or her best interests considered."
<EM>A.A. v. Ab.D.,</EM> 246 Md. App. 418, 448, 228
A.3d 1210 (2020) (quoting <EM>Flynn,</EM> 157 Md.
App. at 410, 852 A.2d 963) (holding that it
was erroneous for a court conducting a
custody hearing to preclude evidence as a
discovery sanction upon a parent without
<Page 130>
first determining if the evidence was relevant
to the child's best interest).

<P20>To effectuate a child's unique
interest in the outcome of a custody dispute,
a BIA is frequently appointed to
represent a child in contested custody proceedings,
and in certain contexts, the failure
to provide independent representation
to a child in such proceedings can be reversible
error. <EM>See Levitt v. Levitt,</EM> 79 Md.
App. 394, 404-05, 556 A.2d 1162 (1989)
(holding that appointment of separate
counsel for a minor child was required to
remedy the "deficiency" arising from the
fact that a court "never heard from a truly
objective witness and did not have the
input of someone who would speak on behalf
of the child"); <EM>see also Auclair,</EM> 127
Md. App. at 14, 730 A.2d 1260 (noting that
parents involved in a custody dispute are
frequently unable to make "legal decisions
that relate to the underlying lawsuit on the
child's behalf[,]" as the dispute may "becloud[]
parental judgment with emotion
and prejudice." (internal quotation marks
and citations omitted)). Similarly, certain
legal privileges are held by the child, and
are unable to be unilaterally waived by the
parties during a contested proceeding;
rather, waiver may require the consent of
the child or their independent counsel. <EM>See
Nagle v. Hooks,</EM> 296 Md. 123, 127-28, 460
A.2d 49 (1983) ("We believe that it is inappropriate
in a continuing custody `battle'
for the custodial parent to control the assertion
or waiver of the privilege of nondisclosure.").

<P20>The unique character of the
finality of child custody orders also merits
discussion. Although custody orders are
intended to be a durable dispensation effectuating
"the longterm ... best interest
of the child[,]" entered after a court is able
to evaluate "the full record of evidence," a
custody order "never achieves quite the
degree of finality that accompanies other
kinds of judgments." <EM>Frase v. Barnhart,</EM>
379 Md. 100, 111-12, 840 A.2d 114 (2003).
Thus, to modify a custody order, a movant
is required to show that a change in circumstances
has occurred which affects the
best interest of the child. <EM>See McCready v.
McCready,</EM> 323 Md. 476, 481-82, 593 A.2d
1128 (1991). The quasi-final nature of a
custody order strikes a balance between
allowing future modification of a custody
determination as circumstances warrant
and affording stability to the child, as well
as preventing a "litigious or disappointed
parent" from "relitigat[ing] questions of
custody endlessly upon the same facts,
hoping to find a chancellor sympathetic to
his or her claim." <EM>Id.</EM> at 481, 593 A.2d 1128.
This principle, by which a material change
in circumstances is required in order to
modify a custody order, doubtless "has its
roots in principles of claim and issue preclusion."
<EM>McMahon v. Piazze,</EM> 162 Md.
App. 588, 594, 875 A.2d 807 (2005). Nevertheless,
our decisional law has stopped
short of applying res judicata to bar successive
motions to modify custody or terminate
parental rights where changed circumstances
are alleged. <EM>Id.</EM> at 595-96, 875
A.2d 807. Likewise, the Supreme Court of
Maryland has advised that:

<B22>The salutary rule that a court does not
relitigate an earlier custody order when
considering a requested modification of
that order does not mean that the court
is precluded from considering evidence
that was before the earlier court. <EM>See
Raible v. Raible,</EM> 242 Md. 586, 594-95
[219 A.2d 777] (1966) (evidence of conduct
occurring before earlier order is
admissible, not to show whether that
order was right or wrong, "but to show
some of the past history of the parties
insofar as that history might aid the
court in appraising their present characters
and fitness as custodians").
<Page 131>

<P00><EM>McCready,</EM> 323 Md. at 481 n.1, 593 A.2d
1128. Thus, to the extent estoppel by judgment
applies in custody determinations, it
does not preclude a court from examining
the facts and circumstances previously litigated.
<EM>Id.</EM>

<HN20><EMB>E. Analysis</EMB>

<P20>This case bears substantial resemblance
to <EM>Hripunovs v. Maximova,</EM> in
which this Court determined that following
the denial of a protective order, collateral
estoppel did not operate to bar evidence
related to previously adjudicated allegations
of abuse in a subsequent final protective
order hearing. <EM>See Hripunovs,</EM> 263
Md. App. at 268, 322 A.3d 813. As in
<EM>Hripunovs,</EM> here Mother previously filed a
request for a protective order, which was
denied by the court. <EM>Id.</EM> at 250, 322 A.3d
813. As in <EM>Hripunovs,</EM> Mother brought
subsequent litigation which both asserted
the same claims alleged in the previous
hearing, but critically also alleged abuse
which continued after the initial protective
order hearing. <EM>Id.</EM> at 268, 322 A.3d 813.
Again, as in <EM>Hripunovs,</EM> Mother attempted
to supply evidence to the court that was
probative of the previously litigated abuse
but had been unavailable to her at the
earlier hearing&mdash;specifically, the video of
Berkowich's forensic interview of B. <EM>Id.</EM> at
254, 268, 322 A.3d 813. However, unlike in
<EM>Hripunovs,</EM> in the instant case, the court
precluded the introduction of evidence of
the alleged abuse based on the doctrine of
collateral estoppel. In our view, this was
erroneous.

<P20>The overriding function of a
protective order hearing is to prevent future
abuse. <EM>Coburn,</EM> 342 Md. at 258, 674
A.2d 951. To that end, "excluding evidence
of past abuse would violate the fundamental
purpose" of such a hearing. <EM>Id.</EM> In our
view, the same principle applies to a child
custody hearing, as exposing a child to the
risk of sexual abuse is unquestionably incompatible
with the "paramount purpose"
of a custody order, which is "securing the
welfare and promoting the best interest of
the child." <EM>Santo v. Santo,</EM> 448 Md. 620,
627, 141 A.3d 74 (2016) (internal quotation
marks and citation omitted). Thus, we determine
that a court's denial of a final
protective order does not later preclude
evidence, argument, or judicial findings of
abuse in subsequent custody proceedings.

<P20>While we recognize the importance
of the principles which underpin the
doctrine of collateral estoppel, <EM>see Garrity,</EM>
447 Md. at 368, 135 A.3d 452, we conclude
that concerns related to these principles
must give way to a child's "indefeasible
right" to have their best interests fully
considered in a custody proceeding. <EM>See
A.A.,</EM> 246 Md. App. at 422, 228 A.3d 1210;
<EM>see also In re Adoption/Guardianship No.
87A262,</EM> 323 Md. 12, 22, 590 A.2d 165
(1991) (determining that "a juvenile court
finding by a preponderance of the evidence"
should not preclude a circuit court
from later "scrutinizing that decision" in a
subsequent case requiring a different standard
of proof). To hold otherwise would be
to condemn courts to potentially fashion
custody orders without the benefit of important
evidence, including evidence which
is "predictive of future [parental] behavior
and its effect on the child." <EM>Azizova,</EM> 243
Md. App. at 357, 220 A.3d 389. Just as
courts in custody modification proceedings
are not precluded from considering evidence
that was before a court in a previous
custody hearing, <EM>McCready,</EM> 323 Md. at
481 n.1, 593 A.2d 1128, and courts evaluating
motions for protective orders are not
precluded from evaluating evidence related
to contentions first alleged in a previous
protective order hearing, <EM>Hripunovs,</EM> 263
Md. App. at 268, 322 A.3d 813, neither
should courts be collaterally estopped from
considering evidence related to an allegation
<Page 132>
in a prior <EM>protective order</EM> hearing in a
subsequent <EM>custody</EM> hearing.<fnr10>

<P20>In so holding, we are also cognizant of
another vital difference between the custody
modification and protective order
hearings&mdash;namely, B.'s ability to have independent
counsel participate in the proceedings.<fnr11>
Here, Mother filed the motion
for protective order, which was ultimately
denied, on B.'s behalf, but B. as an individual
was unrepresented by counsel during
the protective order proceedings. By
contrast, at the subsequent custody hearing,
B. was independently represented by
counsel, which as our caselaw notes, may
be required in contested hearings to allow
a child's best interests to be fully effectuated.
<EM>See Auclair,</EM> 127 Md. App. at 14, 730
A.2d 1260.

<P20>Of importance here, we recognize that
the nature of a contested proceeding between
parents, and particularly one where
allegations of child sexual abuse are involved,
may "becloud[] parental judgment
with emotion and prejudice." <EM>Id.</EM> For this
reason, it was vital that B. be appointed
independent representation so that the
court had the ability to arrive at a conclusion
with the "input of someone who would
speak on behalf of the child." <EM>Levitt,</EM> 79
Md. App. at 404, 556 A.2d 1162. Additionally,
the existence of independent representation
had a substantive effect on the
evidence available in the custody proceeding.
B.'s representation allowed the waiver
of B.'s therapist-client privilege, thereby
allowing testimony that would not have
been available in the earlier protective order
proceeding when B. was unrepresented.
<EM>See Nagle,</EM> 296 Md. at 127-28, 460 A.2d
49.

<P20>Due to B. being independently
represented at the custody hearing, but
not at the prior protective order hearing,
we additionally note that here B. was not
"fully represented, with the same incentives,
by another party in the prior matter[,]"
as is required to apply the doctrine
of collateral estoppel. <EM>Mathews v. Cassidy
Turley Maryland, Inc.,</EM> 435 Md. 584, 628,
80 A.3d 269 (2013). As our caselaw demonstrates,
children are not inherently in
privity with their parents. <EM>See Cochran v.
Griffith Energy Servs., Inc.,</EM> 426 Md. 134,
146, 43 A.3d 999 (2012) (holding that "context
is key" in such a determination). B.'s
counsel in the custody proceeding held the
power to waive B.'s privilege, while Mother
lacked that same ability in the first
proceeding. Even assuming identical motivations,
this would appear to preclude
Mother's ability to "fully represent[]" B.'s
position in the protective order hearing.
<EM>Mathews,</EM> 435 Md. at 628, 80 A.3d 269.

<P20>For the reasons articulated herein, we
conclude that the granting of Father's motion
<EM>in limine</EM> was error as the principle of
collateral estoppel was not applicable in
the custody modification proceedings. Accordingly,
we reverse the judgment of the
<Page 133>
circuit court as to the collateral estoppel
decision and vacate the circuit court's custody
order.<fnr12> On remand, the court will
have the opportunity to conduct a new
custody modification proceeding and make
determinations with the benefit of a more
fulsome record.

<P20><EMB>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT
COURT FOR CECIL COUNTY REVERSED
AS TO THE COLLATERAL
ESTOPPEL DECISION.</EMB>

<P20><EMB>CUSTODY ORDER IS VACATED
AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT
COURT FOR PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT
WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS
TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</EMB>
<FN>
<fnt1> Although we are advised that the appellant's
last name is now Wullschleger, we refer to
her as Augustine for consistency with the proceedings
below and with the briefing materials
submitted to this Court.

<fnt2> To preserve the anonymity of the minor
child, we refer to the child by the randomly
selected letter "B."

<fnt3> Rephrased from: "Did the trial court err in
ruling that Appellant was collaterally estopped
from relying on, or introducing evidence
from, the earlier protective order hearing,
in the custody modification trial, on
whether Appellee has sexually abused the parties'
minor child?"

<fnt4> Because we reverse the judgment of the
circuit court based on Mother's contention
that collateral estoppel is inapplicable to this
case, we need not address her contention that
the court abused its discretion by declining to
grant her sole physical and legal custody of B.

<fnt5> At a later hearing, Mother asserted that the
video recording of the forensic interview was
not made available to her until after the 2021
hearing.

<fnt6> Although no medical record was entered
into evidence, Berkowich testified that a medical
examination of B. had been conducted,
and although she had not personally seen the
report, the examining doctor had "stated that
there w[ere] no obvious signs of trauma."

<fnt7> Although documentation of DSS's decision
does not appear to be in the record, the
circuit court relied on the consistent representations
of all parties to conclude that "following
the Circuit Court's denial of the final
protective order predicated on the allegations
of sexual abuse, that [DSS] then took it upon
itself to amend its finding to rule it out." This
finding was not challenged in the circuit
court, nor does Mother dispute it on appeal.

<fnt8> A BIA is an attorney appointed by a court to
represent a minor child's best interests in an
action where custody, visitation rights, or the
amount of a child support award is contested.
<EM>See</EM> Md. Code, Family Law &sect; 1-202.

<fnt9> Collateral estoppel is distinct from, but
closely related to, the doctrine of res judicata.
<EM>Colandrea,</EM> 361 Md. at 387-88, 761 A.2d 899.
While collateral estoppel applies to facts or
issues conclusively decided in prior litigation
between the parties, res judicata applies when
the second proceeding between the parties is
based on the same cause of action as the first.
<EM>See Powell v. Breslin,</EM> 430 Md. 52, 63-64, 59
A.3d 531 (2013). In such a situation, res judicata
operates to preclude all matters which
could have been litigated in the prior proceeding,
thereby completely obviating any
subsequent claim on the same cause of action.
<EM>See Colandrea,</EM> 361 Md. at 387-88, 761 A.2d
899. Because we agree with the circuit court
that Mother was unable to litigate the modification
of custody in the protective order action,
the court did not err in declining to
apply res judicata in the instant case, and we
shall not examine the doctrine in detail.

<fnt10> In so deciding, we do not obviate the well-established
principle that "an existing custody
order ordinarily should not be modified in the
absence of a showing of changes affecting the
welfare of the child[.]" <EM>Domingues v. Johnson,</EM>
323 Md. 486, 498, 593 A.2d 1133 (1991).

<fnt11> Although nothing in the text of FL &sect; 1-202
&mdash;or in the protective order statutes (FL
&sect;&sect; 4-504.1(c), 4-505(a), and 4-506(d))&mdash;prohibits
the appointment of a BIA in a protective
order hearing, we are unaware of any
Maryland cases where this occurred. In addition,
the protective order statutes do not expressly
authorize appointment of a BIA in a
protective order hearing. While a BIA's appointment
and representation of a child at a
protective order hearing does not appear to
be impermissible, it would seem unlikely and
impractical due to the fast-paced nature of
protective order proceedings and the statute's
purpose of "providing an immediate and effective
remedy" to victims of domestic abuse.
<EM>Coburn,</EM> 342 Md. at 252, 674 A.2d 951 (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted).

<fnt12> To be sure, our decision today does not
endorse a position on the veracity of Mother's
allegations against Father, nor do we seek to
intrude on the circuit court's proper exercise
of its discretion in finding facts, weighing
evidence, and reaching a custody determination
in B.'s best interest.

<P20><dgn>JUSTICE</dgn> <author>FASCIALE</author> delivered the
opinion of the Court.
<SPage 390>
[MT]
<P20>In this appeal, we consider whether
the Hartford Underwriters Insurance
Company (Hartford) is obligated to defend
SIR Electric LLC (SIR) &mdash; the insured and
the employer &mdash; against an employee's
workplace personal injury lawsuit. The
lawsuit alleges that
<SPage 391>
SIR's negligence,
gross negligence, recklessness, and intentional
wrongdoing caused the employee to
suffer bodily injury during an accident on
the job.

<P20>Here, Hartford has no duty to defend
the employer. The employee's allegations
of simple negligence, gross negligence, and
recklessness (the negligence-based claims),
which are subject to the workers' compensation
exclusivity bar, are not covered under
Part One of the insurance policy and
are excluded from coverage under Part
Two of the policy. Additionally, the employee's
allegations of intentional wrongdoing,
known as <EMU>Laidlow</EMU><fnr1> claims, are excluded
under the policy.
<Page 138>

<P20>We therefore affirm the Appellate Division's
judgment upholding the trial judge's
dismissal, without leave to amend, of SIR's
third-party complaint against Hartford.

<CN>I.

<P20>SIR is an electrical contractor that employed
plaintiff Dionicio Rodriguez. Hartford
issued a Workers' Compensation and
Employers' Liability Policy to SIR. Although
we will analyze the Hartford Policy
in greater detail, Part One of the Hartford
Policy provides workers' compensation insurance
for "benefits" under workers' compensation
law. And Part Two of the Hartford
Policy provides employers' liability
insurance for "damages because of bodily
injury," but excludes from coverage,
among other claims, bodily injury intentionally
caused by SIR. While on the job,
Rodriguez opened an electrical panel on a
breaker and injured himself.

<P20>Rodriguez initially filed a petition for
workers' compensation benefits under Part
One of the Hartford Policy. Hartford complied
with its contractual obligation and
processed that petition. After Rodriguez
began receiving those benefits, he filed a
personal
<SPage 392>
injury complaint seeking money
damages for his workplace injuries and
named SIR as a defendant. SIR tendered
the defense of the complaint to Hartford.

<P20>Hartford disclaimed any obligation to
provide a defense. Notably, Hartford determined
that SIR's policy excluded "any
obligation imposed by a workers compensation
... law" and "[b]odily injury intentionally
caused by [SIR]." Hartford concluded
that it accordingly had no duty to
defend SIR against Rodriguez's claims.

<P20>SIR filed a third-party complaint against
Hartford, claiming that Hartford wrongfully
disclaimed defense coverage. SIR argued
that although Rodriguez's complaint
included allegations of intentional wrongdoing,
it also included specific allegations
of non-intentional wrongdoing, such as
"gross negligence" and "simple negligence,"
which SIR contended were covered
by the Hartford Policy.

<P20>Hartford filed a <EMU>Rule</EMU> 4:6-2(e) motion to
dismiss SIR's third-party complaint, and
SIR cross-moved for summary judgment.
The trial judge granted Hartford's motion
and denied SIR's cross-motion, concluding
that the Hartford Policy expressly excluded
intent-based claims. In denying SIR's
cross-motion, the judge determined,
"Hartford has no duty to defend SIR
against [Rodriguez's] common law tort
suit."

<P20>SIR moved for reconsideration and filed
a motion to amend its third-party complaint,
contending for the first time that
the Hartford Policy's enhanced intentional
injury exclusion (EII exclusion) violated
public policy. The judge denied reconsideration
and characterized the sum of Rodriguez's
allegations to be "specifically and
solely a <EMU>Laidlow</EMU> claim." He concluded that
the Hartford Policy excluded insurance
coverage for intentional conduct by SIR.
Consistent with his earlier ruling, the
judge explained that "an employee otherwise
has no [tort] cause of action against
[an] employer for a work-related injury."
The judge denied SIR's motion to amend
as moot because the amendment would be
futile.
<SPage 393>

<P20>On leave to appeal, the Appellate Division
affirmed the orders dismissing
SIR's third-party complaint, denying SIR's
cross-motion for summary judgment, and
<Page 139>
denying SIR's motion to amend its third-party
complaint.

<P20>We granted SIR's motion for leave to
appeal. 257 N.J. 247, 313 A.3d 412 (2024).

<CN>II.

<P20>Relying on unpublished Appellate Division
decisions,<fnr2> SIR argues primarily that
Hartford owes SIR a duty to defend
against Rodriguez's allegations of negligence
and gross negligence. SIR contends
that the appellate court "ignored SIR's
primary contention ... that a duty to defend
exists in the workers' compensation
part, [Part One], of [the Hartford Policy]."
It also asserts that the appellate court
erred by focusing exclusively on Part Two
of the Hartford Policy and the related
endorsement to the Hartford Policy containing
the EII exclusion. SIR maintains
that the judge erred by denying its motion
to amend its third-party complaint, reiterating
that the EII exclusion is against
public policy.

<P20>Hartford argues that it has no duty to
defend SIR against Rodriguez's "negligence-based"
allegations because those
workplace bodily injury tort claims are
unrelated to "benefits" under the workers'
compensation law. As to Rodriguez's <EMU>Laidlow</EMU>
allegations, whether they are characterized
as intentional wrongdoing, "gross
negligence," or "recklessness," Hartford
asserts that the Hartford Policy expressly
excludes those claims. Hartford contends
that SIR waived its argument that the EII
exclusion violates public policy and that, in
any case, SIR's assertion is groundless.
<SPage 394>

<CN>III.

<P20>Long-standing legal principles govern
the question of whether Hartford has a
duty to defend SIR against Rodriguez's
claims.

<CN>A.

<P20>A duty to defend arises from an
insurer's contractual obligation under the
language of the insurance policy. <EMU>Hartford
Accident & Indem. Co. v. Aetna Life &
Cas. Ins. Co.</EMU>, 98 N.J. 18, 22, 483 A.2d 402
(1984). Specifically, "[a]n insurer is contractually
obliged to provide the insured
with a defense against all actions covered
by the insurance policy." <EMU>Abouzaid v. Mansard
Gardens Assocs. LLC</EMU>, 207 N.J. 67,
79, 23 A.3d 338 (2011).

<P20>An insurer's duty to defend is
broader than its duty to indemnify. <EMU>Danek
v. Hommer</EMU>, 28 N.J. Super. 68, 79, 100 A.2d
198 (App. Div. 1953), <EMU>aff'd o.b.</EMU>, 15 N.J. 573,
105 A.2d 677 (1954). A duty to defend
"comes into being when the complaint
states a claim constituting a risk insured
against," regardless of the claim's likelihood
of success. <EMU>Voorhees v. Preferred
Mut. Ins. Co.</EMU>, 128 N.J. 165, 173, 607 A.2d
1255 (1992) (quoting <EMU>Danek</EMU>, 28 N.J. Super.
at 77, 100 A.2d 198). Indeed, the duty to
defend will arise even if "the claims are
poorly developed and almost sure to fail,"
<EMU>id.</EMU> at 174, 607 A.2d 1255, so long as they
"comprehend[] an injury which <EMU>may</EMU> be
within the policy," <EMU>Abouzaid</EMU>, 207 N.J. at
80, 23 A.3d 338 (quoting <EMU>Danek</EMU>, 28 N.J.
Super. at 78, 100 A.2d 198). "Liability of
the insured to the plaintiff is not the criterion;
it is the allegation in the complaint of
a cause of action, which, if sustained, will
impose a liability <EMU>covered by the policy</EMU>."
<EMU>Danek</EMU>, 28 N.J. Super. at 77, 100 A.2d 198
(emphasis added). Therefore, "[w]hether
<Page 140>
an insurer has a duty to defend is determined
by comparing the allegations in the
complaint with the language of the insurance
policy. When the two correspond, the
duty to defend arises, irrespective of the
claim's actual merit." <EMU>Voorhees</EMU>, 128 N.J. at
174, 607 A.2d 1255. But an insurer has no
duty to defend against a claim, "which
measured by the pleadings, even if successful,
would not be within the policy
coverage." <EMU>Danek</EMU>, 28 N.J. Super. at 77,
100 A.2d 198.
<SPage 395>

<P20>We interpret the insurance
policy terms de novo. <EMU>AC Ocean Walk,
LLC v. Am. Guarantee & Liab. Ins. Co.</EMU>,
256 N.J. 294, 312, 307 A.3d 1174 (2024).
"[A]n insurance policy should be interpreted
according to its plain and ordinary
meaning," with any ambiguities "resolved
in favor of the insured." <EMU>Voorhees</EMU>, 128
N.J. at 175, 607 A.2d 1255. But courts
cannot "engage in a strained construction
to support the imposition of liability or
write a better policy for the insured than
the one purchased." <EMU>AC Ocean Walk</EMU>, 256
N.J. at 312, 307 A.3d 1174 (internal quotation
marks omitted) (quoting <EMU>Chubb Custom
Ins. Co. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.</EMU>,
195 N.J. 231, 238, 948 A.2d 1285 (2008)).

<P20>The covered-claim limitation on the duty
to defend is particularly significant here,
given the carefully constructed compromise
that undergirds our workers' compensation
scheme.

<P20>In 1911, the Legislature enacted
the New Jersey Workers' Compensation
Act, N.J.S.A. 34:15-1 to -147, reflecting
a "historic trade-off whereby
employees relinquished their right to
pursue common-law remedies in exchange
for automatic entitlement to certain,
but reduced, benefits whenever
they suffered injuries by accident arising
out of and in the course of employment."
<EMU>Millison v. E.I. Du Pont de
Nemours & Co.</EMU>, 101 N.J. 161, 174, 501
A.2d 505 (1985). Once the employer and
employee agree to the trade-off,<fnr3> "compensation
for personal injuries ... by
accident arising out of and in the course
of employment shall be made by the
employer without regard to the negligence
of the employer." N.J.S.A. 34:15-7.
Although employees may receive "swift
and certain compensation payments" under
the Act, they give up their right to
a "potentially larger recovery in a common-law
action" for negligence against
their employer. <EMU>Millison</EMU>, 101 N.J. at 174,
501 A.2d 505. Accordingly, workers' compensation
is
<SPage 396>
the exclusive remedy for
injured employees who qualify under the
Act. <EMU>See id.</EMU> at 169, 501 A.2d 505.

<P20>The only exception to that "exclusivity
bar" or "workers' compensation bar"
is for injuries caused by "intentional
wrongs," for which an employee may still
seek redress under common law causes of
action. <EMU>See id.</EMU> at 177, 501 A.2d 505;
<EMU>Schmidt v. Smith</EMU>, 155 N.J. 44, 49, 713 A.2d
1014 (1998) ("In exchange for this statutory
remedy, the employee surrenders rights
to sue the employer or fellow employees at
common law except in cases where the
injury stems from intentional wrongs committed
by the employer or the fellow employees.");
<EMU>see also</EMU> N.J.S.A. 34:15-8 ("If an
injury or death is compensable under this
article, a person shall not be liable to
anyone at common law or otherwise on
account of such injury or death for any act
or omission occurring while such person
<Page 141>
was ... injured or killed, except for intentional
wrong.").

<P20>In <EMU>Laidlow</EMU>, this Court clarified
the test to determine when an employer's
conduct rises to the level of an "intentional
wrong" under N.J.S.A. 34:15-8, holding
that

<B22>(1) the employer must know that his
actions are substantially certain to result
in injury or death to the employee, and
(2) the resulting injury and the circumstances
of its infliction on the worker
must be (a) more than a fact of life of
industrial employment and (b) plainly
beyond anything the Legislature intended
the Workers' Compensation Act to
immunize. [<EMU>Richter v. Oakland Bd. of
Educ.</EMU>, 246 N.J. 507, 536, 252 A.3d 161
(2021) (quoting <EMU>Laidlow v. Hariton
Mach. Co., Inc.</EMU>, 170 N.J. 602, 617, 790
A.2d 884 (2002)).]

<P00>Under that test, "an intentional wrong is
not limited to actions taken with a subjective
desire to harm, but also includes instances
where an employer knows that the
consequences of those acts are substantially
certain to result in such harm." <EMU>Laidlow</EMU>,
170 N.J. at 613, 790 A.2d 884. But the
"substantial certainty" test is still a high
standard to meet: to avoid allowing employees
to circumvent the Act, courts
"must demand a virtual certainty" before
employees can proceed under the intentional
wrong exception to sue their employer
in tort. <EMU>Van Dunk v. Reckson Assocs.
Realty Corp.</EMU>, 210 N.J. 449, 470, 45
A.3d 965 (2012) (quoting <EMU>Millison</EMU>, 101 N.J.
at 178, 501 A.2d 505).
<SPage 397>

<P20>As noted above, Rodriguez
raised claims based on negligence, gross
negligence, and recklessness on the one
hand, and <EMU>Laidlow</EMU> claims on the other.
The trial judge concluded on reconsideration
that the entirety of Rodriguez's allegations
"specifically and solely" amounted
to a <EMU>Laidlow</EMU> claim. We disagree with the
trial judge's characterization and conclude
that the negligence-based claims are different
from Rodriguez's intent-based <EMU>Laidlow</EMU>
claims.

<P20>In <EMU>Van Dunk</EMU>, this Court held that although
the employer committed an "exceptional
wrong" in directing an employee to
enter a trench in violation of OSHA guidelines,
the employee did not meet the <EMU>Millison</EMU>
and <EMU>Laidlow</EMU> intentional-wrong test because
a potentially grossly negligent, or
even reckless, act was not an "intentional
wrong." 210 N.J. at 472, 45 A.3d 965. It
follows that if gross negligence is not
enough to meet the <EMU>Millison</EMU> and <EMU>Laidlow</EMU>
intentional-wrong test, neither is simple
negligence.<fnr4> This Court emphasized that
"[t]he dividing line between <EMU>negligent or
reckless conduct on the one hand and intentional
wrong on the other hand</EMU> must be
drawn with caution" to avoid employees
finding a loophole to the Act's exclusivity
bar. <EMU>Van Dunk</EMU>, 210 N.J. at 470, 45 A.3d
965 (quoting <EMU>Millison</EMU>, 101 N.J. at 178, 501
A.2d 505) (emphasis added). Accordingly,
Rodriguez's negligence, gross negligence,
and recklessness claims are distinct from
his <EMU>Laidlow</EMU> claims and are limited by the
Act's exclusivity bar. <EMU>Laidlow</EMU> claims, by
contrast, are not limited by the Act's exclusivity
bar.

<CN>B.

<P20>Against that legal backdrop, we consider
whether Hartford owes a duty to defend
here. We begin by reviewing Rodriguez's
tort claims against SIR, and we then examine
the terms of the Hartford Policy.
<Page 142>
<SPage 398>

<P20>In his complaint, Rodriguez makes
the following allegations:

<B42>30. <EMU>S[IR] Electric recklessly directed</EMU>
[Rodriguez] to perform an abnormally
dangerous activity in opening an electrical
panel without any training or warnings
in complete disregard for his health
and safety.

<B42>31. <EMU>S[IR] Electric was grossly negligent</EMU>
in requiring [Rodriguez] to perform
an abnormally dangerous activity in
opening an electrical panel without any
training or warnings in complete disregard
for his health and safety.

<B44>....

<B42>37. <EMU>Defendants were negligent</EMU> for
their failure to properly safeguard the
premises.

<B42>38. <EMU>Defendants were negligent</EMU> in their
actions and omissions, which proximately
caused [Rodriguez]'s accident.

<B44>....

<B42>45. <EMU>Defendants were negligent</EMU> in permitting
a dangerous condition to exist.

<B42>46. <EMU>Defendants were negligent</EMU> in the
ownership, operation, maintenance, upkeep,
monitoring, supervision and management
of the property and the construction
site....

<B42>47. <EMU>Defendants were negligent</EMU> in the
hiring, employment, and/or continued
employment of [their] employees/contractors.

<B44>....

<B42>49. <EMU>Defendant S[IR] Electric intentionally
disregarded</EMU> known safety features,
required [Rodriguez] to work on
electrical equipment without safety devices,
without warnings and <EMU>knowing
there was a substantial certainty that
[Rodriguez] would be harmed, and
thereby intentionally or with substantial
certainty</EMU>, exposed [Rodriguez] to the
risk of death or serious injury.

<B44>....

<B42>52. Defendant S[IR] Electric's conduct
was so egregious as to cause a reasonable
person to conclude with <EMU>substantial
certainty</EMU> that [Rodriguez] would be injured
in the very manner in which occurred
to [Rodriguez].

<B42>53. [Rodriguez]'s resulting injuries
and the context surrounding them are
more than a fact of life of electrical
employment and are <EMU>plainly beyond anything
the [L]egislature could have contemplated
as entitling the employees to
recover only under the Compensation</EMU>
Act.

<B44>....

<B42>55. S[IR] Electric's reckless indifference
for [Rodriguez]'s safety and well-being
<EMU>rise to the level of a Laidlow
claim</EMU>[,] piercing the Workers Compensation
Act bar.

<B44>....

<B42>67. <EMU>As a result of the negligence of the
Defendants</EMU> as set forth herein, [Rodriguez]
was caused serious injuries, including
monetary damages, pain and
suffering, and out of pocket cost(s).

<B44>....

<B42>70. <EMU>As a result of the negligence of the
Defendants</EMU>, singly, in combination, jointly,
and severally, [Rodriguez] has been
damaged in an amount that exceeds the
<SPage 399>
jurisdictional limits of all lower
[c]ourts that would otherwise have jurisdiction
herein, and demands damages,
compensatory damages, pre-judgment
interest, costs and disbursements in this
action.

<B22>[(emphases added).]

<P00>We now turn to the language of the Hartford
Policy itself.

<CN>C.

<P20>The Hartford Policy is divided into several
parts, and the parties have raised
arguments about Part One and Part Two
of the policy. We consider each in turn.
<Page 143>

<CN>1.

<P20>Part One of the Hartford Policy
provides workers' compensation insurance
and states:

<B22><EMB>A. How This Insurance Applies</EMB>

<B22>This workers compensation insurance
applies to bodily injury by accident or
bodily injury by disease. Bodily injury
includes resulting death[.]

<B22>....

<B22><EMB>B. We Will Pay</EMB>

<B22>We will pay promptly when due the
benefits required of you by the workers
compensation law.

<B22><EMB>C. We Will Defend</EMB>

<B22>We have the right and duty to defend at
our expense any claim, proceeding or
suit against you <EMU>for benefits</EMU> payable by
this insurance. We have the right to
investigate and settle these claims, proceedings
or suits.

<B22>We have no duty to defend a claim,
proceeding or suit that is not covered by
this insurance.

<B22>[(emphases added).]

<P20>Part One of the Hartford Policy
incorporates by reference the requirements
set forth in the workers' compensation
law. As we have noted, the Act covers
employees' accidental bodily injuries "arising
out of and in the course of [their]
employment, of which the actual or lawfully
imputed negligence of the employer is
the natural and proximate cause." N.J.S.A.
34:15-1. For claims alleging conduct other
than intentional wrongdoing by an employer,
workers' compensation "is not cumulative
or supplemental to
<SPage 400>
the tort system,
but is wholly substitutional." 1 <EMU>Modern
Workers' Compensation</EMU> &sect; 102.1 at 67.

<P20>Money damages for negligence-based
tort claims do not fall under the policy
language, "benefits ... required by a
workers' compensation law," which instead
include recovery of medical benefits under
N.J.S.A. 34:15-15; death benefits for dependents
under N.J.S.A. 34:15-13; and
temporary disability benefits, permanent
total benefits, or permanent partial benefits
under N.J.S.A. 34:15-12(a) to (c), regardless
of fault. Because money damages
based on tort claims are not "benefits" and
thus are not a covered risk, Hartford has
no duty under Part One to defend SIR
against Rodriguez's claims seeking such
damages. Rodriguez's personal injury lawsuit
does not seek benefits as defined by
the Act; instead, it seeks money damages
as compensation for his workplace injuries.
Rodriguez already recovered those benefits
available under Part One of the Hartford
Policy for his injury, and Hartford
satisfied its contractual obligation to SIR
by providing Rodriguez with those workers'
compensation benefits separate from
this action.

<P20>SIR does not argue that Part One covers
Rodriguez's <EMU>Laidlow</EMU> allegations of intentional
wrongdoing. That is because Part
One applies only to benefits under the Act
and cannot impose a duty to defend for
claims of intentional misconduct, which fall
outside the Act.

<P20>Therefore, Part One of the Hartford
Policy imposes no duty to defend SIR
against any of Rodriguez's claims.

<CN>2.

<P20>Part Two of the Hartford Policy
provides employers' liability insurance.
Employers' liability insurance "is intended
to serve as a gap-filler providing protection
to the employer in those situations
where the employee has a right to bring a
tort action despite provisions of the workers'
compensation statute." <EMU>Schmidt</EMU>, 155
N.J. at 49-50, 713 A.2d 1014 (internal quotation
marks omitted) (quoting <EMU>Producers
Dairy Delivery Co. v. Sentry Ins. Co.</EMU>, 41
<SPage 401>
Cal.3d 903, 226 Cal.Rptr. 558, 718 P.2d
<Page 144>
920, 927 (1986)). N.J.S.A. 34:15-71 and -72
require an employer to "make sufficient
provision for the complete payment of any
obligation which he may incur to an injured
employee." Unless the Commissioner
of Insurance approves an employer to provide
its own liability insurance under
N.J.S.A. 34:15-77, every employer "shall
insure and keep insured his liability in any
stock company or mutual association authorized
to engage in workmen's compensation
or employer's liability insurance in
this State." N.J.S.A. 34:15-78.

<P20>Employers' liability policies must
cover both claims for benefits in the Division
of Workers' Compensation and claims
for workplace injuries in a common law
court that fall outside of the workers' compensation
system. <EMU>Schmidt</EMU>, 155 N.J. at 49,
713 A.2d 1014 (citing N.J.S.A. 34:15-72). In
practice, "[w]orkers' compensation policies
are routinely written in combination with
an employers' liability policy. The purpose
of this combination of coverage is to provide
protection for injured employees in
those situations <EMU>where workers' compensation
insurance itself may not apply</EMU>."
George J. Kenny & Frank A. Lattal, <EMU>New
Jersey Insurance Law</EMU> &sect; 19-4:1 (2024) (emphasis
added).

<P20>Part Two of the Hartford Policy sets
forth the following relevant terms and limitations
of coverage for employers' liability
insurance:

<B22><EMB>A. How This Insurance Applies</EMB>

<B22>This <EMU>employers liability insurance applies
to bodily injury by accident</EMU> or bodily
injury by disease. Bodily injury includes
resulting death.

<B22>....

<B22><EMB>B. We Will Pay</EMB>

<B22>We will pay all sums that you legally
must pay as damages because of bodily
injury to your employees, provided the
bodily injury is covered by this Employers
Liability Insurance.

<B22>....

<B22><EMB>C. Exclusions</EMB>

<B22>This insurance does not cover:

<B44>....

<B44>4. <EMU>Any obligation imposed by a workers
compensation</EMU>, occupational disease,
unemployment compensation, or
disability benefits law, or any similar
law;
<SPage 402>

<B44>5. <EMU>Bodily injury intentionally
caused or aggravated by you</EMU>;

<B22>....

<B22><EMB>D. We Will Defend</EMB>

<B22>We have the right and duty to defend, at
our expense, any claim, proceeding or
suit against you for damages payable by
this insurance. We have the right to
investigate and settle these claims, proceedings
and suits.

<B22><EMU>We have no duty to defend a claim,
proceeding or suit that is not covered by
this insurance.</EMU> We have no duty to defend
or continue defending after we
have paid our applicable limit of liability
under this insurance.

<P00>[(emphases added).]

<P20>The Hartford Policy contains an additional
"New Jersey Part Two Employers
Liability Endorsement," applying "only to
the insurance provided by Part Two (Employers
Liability Insurance)." That is the
so-called EII exclusion, which states that,

<B22><EMU>[w]ith respect to Exclusion C5, this insurance
does not cover any and all intentional
wrongs within the exception allowed
by N.J.S.A. 34:15-8 including</EMU> but
not limited to, bodily injury caused or
aggravated by an intentional wrong
committed by you or your employees, or
<EMU>bodily injury resulting from an act or
omission by you or your employees,
which is substantially certain to result in
injury</EMU>.
<Page 145>

<B22>[(emphases added).]

<P20>Like Part One, Part Two of the Hartford
Policy covers suits for damages "because
of bodily injury by accident." Whereas
Part One covers obligations under the
Act, however, Part Two expressly excludes
from coverage &mdash; in Exclusion C4 &mdash; "obligation[s]
imposed by a workers compensation,
occupational disease, unemployment
compensation, or disability benefits law, or
any similar law." As we have seen, the Act
covers employees' accidental bodily injuries
"arising out of and in the course of
[their] employment, of which the actual or
lawfully imputed negligence of the employer
is the natural and proximate cause."
N.J.S.A. 34:15-1. And because negligence,
gross negligence, and recklessness claims
are processed exclusively through workers'
compensation, they consequently are "obligations
imposed solely by a workers' compensation
... law" under Exclusion C4.
<EMU>See Millison</EMU>, 101 N.J. at 176-77, 501 A.2d
505; <EMU>Laidlow</EMU>, 170 N.J. at 611, 790 A.2d
884; N.J.S.A. 34:15-8.

<P20>The C4 exclusion thus aligns with the
purpose of requiring employers to carry
both workers' compensation insurance and
<SPage 403>
employers' liability insurance: it is a
logical reflection of the gap-filling purpose
of employers' liability insurance because it
excludes from coverage under Part Two
claims that are already covered under Part
One. There is no gap to be filled here for
the negligence, gross negligence, and recklessness
claims against SIR because Part
One already provided the required workers'
compensation coverage &mdash; the exclusive
remedy available &mdash; for those claims. <EMU>See
Millison</EMU>, 101 N.J. at 176-77, 501 A.2d 505;
<EMU>Laidlow</EMU>, 170 N.J. at 611, 790 A.2d 884;
N.J.S.A. 34:15-8. Employers' liability coverage
is meant to protect the employer "in
those situations where the employee has
the right to bring a tort action outside of
the workers' compensation bar,"<fnr5> Kenny &
Lattal, &sect; 19-4:2, and here, Rodriguez does
not have a right to bring his negligence-based
claims outside of the bar. In short,
Part Two of the Hartford Policy does not
require Hartford to defend SIR against
Rodriguez's non-<EMU>Laidlow</EMU> claims because
they are excluded from coverage under
Exclusion C4.

<P20>SIR's reliance on <EMU>Danek v. Hommer</EMU> is
misplaced. In <EMU>Danek</EMU>, the husband of an
injured employee brought a common law
action against the employer for loss of
consortium. 28 N.J. Super. at 72-73, 100
A.2d 198. The appellate court held that
although the husband's exclusive remedy
fell under the Act, the insurance carrier
nonetheless had a duty to defend the employer
in the husband's action because the
policy agreed to cover "any suits ... alleging
such injuries and demanding damages
or compensation" even if such suits are
"wholly groundless." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 74, 78-79, 100
A.2d 198. Notably, this Court affirmed <EMU>Danek</EMU>
for the reasons set forth by the Appellate
Division. <EMU>See</EMU> 15 N.J. 573, 105 A.2d 677
(1954). The policy in <EMU>Danek</EMU> was much
broader than the Hartford Policy and did
not contain exclusions to the duty to defend.
<EMU>See</EMU> 28
<SPage 404>
N.J. Super. at 72, 100 A.2d
198. Here, unlike <EMU>Danek</EMU>, the language of
the Hartford Policy provides no coverage,
regardless of the ultimate question of
SIR's liability to Rodriguez.

<P20>Turning to Rodriguez's <EMU>Laidlow</EMU>
claims, or claims of intentional wrongdoing,
Part Two imposes no duty on Hartford
to defend SIR because those claims
are not covered by the Hartford Policy.
<Page 146>

<P20>The C5 exclusion specifically excludes
from insurance coverage any claims for
"[b]odily injury intentionally caused or aggravated
by [SIR]." The EII exclusion
elaborates on C5 by excluding "all intentional
wrongs within the exception allowed
by N.J.S.A. 34:15-8 including ... bodily
injury caused or aggravated by an intentional
wrong ... which is substantially certain
to result in injury." The <EMU>Laidlow</EMU>
claims of intentional wrongdoing in the
complaint are expressly excluded under
the plain language of the Part Two policy
exclusions as "intentionally caused or aggravated"
by SIR under the C5 exclusion
and as "substantially certain to result in
injury" under the EII exclusion endorsement.
Because the claims are not covered
by the Hartford Policy, they cannot trigger
a duty to defend on the part of the
insurer.

<P20>In sum, none of Rodriguez's claims &mdash;
whether for negligent, grossly negligent,
or recklessly indifferent conduct or for intentional
wrongdoing &mdash; fall within the coverage
established in either Part One or
Part Two of the Hartford Policy.

<CN>IV.

<P20>Finally, we conclude that the
trial judge properly denied SIR's motion
for leave to amend its third-party complaint
as futile. <EMU>See C.V. v. Waterford Twp.
Bd. of Educ.</EMU>, 255 N.J. 289, 306, 300 A.3d
958 (2023). An amendment is futile "when
the newly asserted claim is not sustainable
as a matter of law. In other words, there is
no point to permitting the filing of an
amended pleading when a subsequent motion
to dismiss must be granted."
<SPage 405>
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
(quoting <EMU>Notte v. Merchs. Mut. Ins. Co.</EMU>,
185 N.J. 490, 501, 888 A.2d 464 (2006)).

<P20>SIR moved for reconsideration and filed
a motion to amend its third-party complaint,
contending for the first time that
the Hartford Policy's EII exclusion violated
public policy. At oral argument, SIR
acknowledged that it filed its motion to
amend only after the trial judge found
Hartford did not owe SIR a duty to defend
under Part Two. Contrary to SIR's contention,
the EII exclusion does not violate
public policy. Amending the pleading to
bring that argument would therefore have
been futile.

<P20>Exclusions from coverage for intentional
acts are common. This Court has consistently
reiterated the principle that "[p]olicy
provisions that exclude coverage resulting
from intentional wrongful acts are
`common,' are `accepted as valid limitations'
and are consistent with public policy."
<EMU>Harleysville Ins. Cos. v. Garitta</EMU>, 170
N.J. 223, 231, 785 A.2d 913 (2001) (alteration
in original) (quoting <EMU>Allstate Ins. Co.
v. Malec</EMU>, 104 N.J. 1, 6, 514 A.2d 832
(1986)). In <EMU>Allstate</EMU>, we held that an exclusion
in an automobile liability insurance
policy for the insured's intentional wrongful
acts did not violate public policy. 104
N.J. at 13, 514 A.2d 832. In <EMU>Harleysville</EMU>,
we upheld an intentional wrong exclusion
in a homeowner's insurance policy. 170
N.J. at 225-26, 785 A.2d 913. Our case law
and long-standing jurisprudence undermine
SIR's belated contention that intentional
wrong exclusions are generally inconsistent
with public policy.

<P20>And more specific legal developments
support the validity of the exclusions here.
In two companion cases, this Court considered
C5 exclusions in employers' liability
policies &mdash; like the C5 exclusion in the
Hartford Policy &mdash; that excluded coverage
for bodily injury intentionally caused or
aggravated by the employer. <EMU>See Charles
Beseler Co. v. O'Gorman & Young, Inc.</EMU>,
188 N.J. 542, 548, 911 A.2d 47 (2006); <EMU>N.J.
Mfrs. Ins. Co. v. Delta Plastics Corp.</EMU>, 188
N.J. 582, 582, 911 A.2d 477 (2006).
<Page 147>

<P20>In those cases, this Court held that the
C5 exclusions did "not unambiguously exclude
injuries falling under the `substantially
<SPage 406>
certain' prong of the intentional-wrong
exception recognized by <EMU>Laidlow</EMU>."
<EMU>Beseler</EMU>, 188 N.J. at 547, 911 A.2d 47.
Because the exclusions did not unambiguously
exclude coverage, we held that the
insurers were obligated to defend the employers.
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 547-48, 911 A.2d 47. Due to
the "lack of express language excluding
conduct substantially certain to result in
injury," the C5 exclusions were ambiguous
and thus construed in favor of the insured
employers. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 548, 911 A.2d 47.

<P20>Following <EMU>Beseler</EMU> and <EMU>Delta Plastics</EMU>,
the Compensation Rating and Inspection
Bureau (CRIB), pursuant to its authority
to change its policy forms set forth in the
New Jersey Workers' Compensation and
Employers' Liability Insurance Manual
(Manual), N.J.S.A. 34:15-90.2(i), amended
the Manual to include an updated New
Jersey Part Two Employers Liability Endorsement.
The endorsement added language
to the standard C5 exclusion because
CRIB found it was necessary "to
restore the intent of the policy exclusion
for intentional injury." CRIB Manual
Amendment Bulletin #436 (2007). CRIB
found that our rulings in <EMU>Beseler</EMU> and <EMU>Delta
Plastics</EMU> on the C5 exclusion "represent[ed]
a significant erosion of the exclusive remedy
provision of the [Act] and may lead to
the increased costs in the price of workers
compensation and employers liability insurance."
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU> Thus, to restore the C5
intentional wrong exclusion while conforming
with our directive that such an exclusion
must be unambiguous, the new endorsement
was amended. It provides that

<B22>[w]ith respect to Exclusion C5, this insurance
does not cover any and all intentional
wrongs within the exception allowed
by N.J.S.A. 34:15-8 including but
not limited to, bodily injury caused or
aggravated by an intentional wrong
committed by you or your employees, or
bodily injury resulting from an act or
omission by you or your employees,
which is substantially certain to result in
injury.

<B22>[CRIB Manual Amendment Bulletin
#436, Exhibit 1, effective July 1, 2007.]

<P20>The New Jersey Department of Banking
and Insurance (DOBI) approved the Manual
Amendment Bulletin #436, which included
the amended endorsement to the
C5 exclusion, in a letter dated May 23,
2007. The EII exclusion in the Hartford
Policy contains language identical to the
language approved by DOBI in 2007 and
<SPage 407>
complies with our holding in <EMU>Beseler</EMU> by
including "express language excluding conduct
substantially certain to result in injury."
188 N.J. at 548, 911 A.2d 47. Indeed,
the EII exclusion has been in existence for
seventeen years.

<P20>Thus, SIR's amendment would be futile
because the challenged intentional wrong
exclusions are not against public policy.
Rather, those exclusions comply with <EMU>Beseler</EMU>
and <EMU>Delta Plastics</EMU> and have been
DOBI-approved since 2007. <EMU>See</EMU> Kenny &
Lattal, &sect; 19-4:2 n.20.

<CN>V.

<P20>We affirm the Appellate Division's judgment,
which upheld the trial judge's order
dismissing SIR's third-party complaint
against Hartford, and conclude that Hartford
has no duty to defend SIR against
Rodriguez's on-the-job personal injury
lawsuit.

<P20><author>PER CURIAM</author>.
<SPage 409>
[MT]
<P20>We affirm the Appellate Division's
judgment substantially for the reasons expressed
in the Honorable Jack M. Sabatino's
comprehensive opinion, <EMU>State v. Fuquan
K. Knight</EMU>, 477 N.J. Super. 400, 307
A.3d 552 (App. Div. 2023). In doing so, we
concur with the
<SPage 410>
Appellate Division's
guidance and list of non-exclusive factors
for trial courts to consider in "dealing with
the admission of surveillance videos and
with requests by deliberating juries to replay
surveillance video evidence, and to do
so at modified speeds or with intermittent
pauses." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 425-26, 307 A.3d 552. We
also agree with the opinion's recommendation
that the Model Criminal Jury Charge
Committee consider a model charge regarding
jury requests to replay video evidence.
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 426, 307 A.3d 552. We add the
following comments.

<P20>In this case, the jury requested and
watched the short video at issue in slow
motion during deliberations. The video,
taken by a security camera with a vantage
point from inside a deli, is of the back
interior of the deli and its back door. From
that perspective, the only view to the out-side
was through a relatively small half
window in the back door, which was further
obstructed by a sign on the window.
The pertinent portion of the video was
approximately six seconds in length and
showed four men (defendants, their co-defendant,
and the victim) walk by outside,
behind the deli where the alleged robbery
occurred. As a result, the brief images of
defendants appear solely through the half
window in the deli's back door. In the six-second
video, the time it took the men to
walk by the window occupied approximately
two seconds. So not only was the action
taking place in the video somewhat obstructed,
but the video was also "very
short" and the "rapid activity in the six-second
segment [was] not easy to follow at
normal speed," as the Appellate Division
aptly described. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 424, 307 A.3d 552.

<P20>Watching a video in slow motion is a
commonplace method of playing a video
that is not beyond the ken of an average
juror. Pushing a button to play a video at a
speed slower than normal to assist the
jury in viewing the difficult-to-perceive recording
here was not an alteration or distortion
of the video. It was the same exact
video &mdash; simply played in slow motion.<fnr1>
<Page 150>
<SPage 411>

<P20>This Court said as much in <EMU>State
v. Watson</EMU>, 254 N.J. 558, 298 A.3d 1049
(2023). In contrasting the presentation of
evidence in which elaborate forensic video
techniques are used, we stated that "[s]pecialized
knowledge would not ordinarily be
required for other types of adjustments,
like adjusting the speed of a video or
creating a straightforward composite video,
a screenshot, or an enlarged photo
from a video." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 606, 298 A.3d 1049.
The issue in <EMU>Watson</EMU> involved the bounds
of proper video narration testimony by law
enforcement witnesses, so the focus of the
Court's analysis was on lay and expert
testimony. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 591-608, 298 A.3d 1049.
The principles regarding the attributes of
video evidence described in <EMU>Watson</EMU> are
nevertheless relevant here and remain the
same: playing a video at a slower speed is
a basic action that does not change or alter
the admitted video evidence.

<P20>Our decision in <EMU>Boland v. Dolan</EMU>, 140
N.J. 174, 657 A.2d 1189 (1995), is instructive.
There, in opposing the plaintiff's slip-and-fall
claim, the defendants entered a
photograph into evidence that showed the
bottoms of the plaintiff's shoes. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 178,
657 A.2d 1189. The defendants argued that
the soles of plaintiff's shoes were worn and
therefore caused the plaintiff's fall. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
Despite requests from the defendants, the
trial judge did not allow the jury to view
the picture with a magnifying glass during
trial. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 178, 180, 657 A.2d 1189. After
the jury requested a magnifying glass during
deliberations, the plaintiff objected. <EMU>Id.</EMU>
at 180, 657 A.2d 1189. Plaintiff argued that
magnification amounted to changing the
evidence and that he had not had an opportunity
to review the magnified photograph
previously. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> The judge overruled
the objection, noting that "[t]his is
simply a tool for them to look at the
photographs ... it's not a distortion or
changing the photograph." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 180-81,
657 A.2d 1189. The judge thus sent the
jury a conventional magnifying glass. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
The jury ultimately found for the defendants.
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 181, 657 A.2d 1189. The Appellate
Division, however, reversed on appeal
because it doubted the jury's ability to
evaluate the shoes' slip resistance based on
a magnified image of the soles without
testimony from an expert witness. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
<SPage 412>

<P20>This Court granted certification and
reversed. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 180, 190, 657 A.2d 1189.
First, we agreed with other jurisdictions
and prior New Jersey case law that a
magnifying glass was not new evidence,
but merely a commonplace tool familiar to
the jury. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 181-85, 188, 657 A.2d 1189.
We also differentiated between resources
that supplement evidence by impermissibly
adding meaning to properly admitted
evidence and resources, like a magnifying
glass, that aid understanding by "highlight[ing]
or illustrat[ing] evidence properly
admitted or testimony of witnesses
properly allowed during the trial." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at
185-87, 657 A.2d 1189. Specifically, we distinguished
the use of the magnifying glass
in <EMU>Boland</EMU> from the discovery &mdash; by the jury
during deliberations &mdash; of new (and thus
not properly admitted) evidence in <EMU>State v.
Anderson</EMU>, 251 N.J. Super. 327, 332, 598
A.2d 229 (App. Div. 1991), and from the
impermissible use of a dictionary during
deliberations in <EMU>Palestroni v. Jacobs</EMU>, 10
N.J. Super. 266, 271, 77 A.2d 183 (App.
Div. 1950). <EMU>See Boland</EMU>, 140 N.J. at 185-87,
657 A.2d 1189.

<P20>Second, we did not require expert testimony
before the magnifying glass could be
utilized and found that for "an instrument
of `common knowledge,' like an ordinary
magnifying glass," such testimony is usually
not needed. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 189, 657 A.2d 1189.
We observed that the Appellate Division
erred by focusing on the lack of expert
testimony and found that "[t]he focus
should first be whether such testimony is
needed or whether common knowledge
suffices for use of the instrument in issue."
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
<Page 151>

<P20>Here, playing in slow motion the
same video that was properly admitted
into evidence to highlight the action occurring
onscreen and assist the jury is generally
no different from allowing the jury in
<EMU>Boland</EMU> to use a magnifying glass to meticulously
inspect a picture. The relevant portion
of the video at issue in this case was
fleeting and difficult to perceive. Slowing
the video down, a familiar adjustment in
video playback, did not change or distort
the evidence but simply aided the jury's
examination of what took
<SPage 413>
place in the
video by playing it at an easily discernable
pace.<fnr2>

<P20>But some tools or functions may
be so specialized that their usage constitutes
an alteration of evidence, or the creation
of new evidence. If a party intends
to play a video with something beyond the
"basic techniques" noted in <EMU>Watson</EMU>, that
party must come forward and alert the
trial court and opposing counsel to any
modifications or alterations made to the
evidence. In those situations, a qualified
expert may need to testify about the modifications
consistent with N.J.R.E. 702.
<EMU>Watson</EMU>, 254 N.J. at 606, 298 A.3d 1049
(explaining that an expert would be required
to testify about how they "enhance[d]
the quality of an electronic or
video recording," or used "more elaborate
forensic techniques ... like `pixel tracking'").

<P20>CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and
JUSTICES PATTERSON, PIERRE-LOUIS,
WAINER APTER, FASCIALE,
NORIEGA, and HOFFMAN join in this
opinion.
<FN>
<fnt1> Indeed, at the trial level, defendants did not
argue that slowing down the short clip in any
way distorted the images.

defendants, <EMU>see</EMU> Eugene M. Caruso et al., <EMU>Slow

[MT]
<P20>Defendant Steven Italiano appeals from
the December 5, 2022 trial court order
denying his motion to dismiss the indictment
charging him with fourth-degree operating
a motor vehicle during a second or
subsequent driving while intoxicated
(DWI) related license suspension, N.J.S.A.
2C:40-26(b). Following our review of the
record and the applicable legal principles,
we affirm.

<P20>This appeal raises an issue of first impression.
We must decide whether a defendant,
serving sequentially several consecutive
periods of driver's license suspensions
imposed for various convictions including
DWI offenses, can be charged with violating
N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b) for driving during
the suspension period for a non-DWI-related
offense while awaiting commencement
<Page 155>
of a court-imposed DWI license suspension.
For the reasons set forth below, we
conclude that because the effective date of
defendant's most recent DWI-related sentence
was delayed only due to other consecutively
imposed accumulated sentences,
defendant violated N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b)
when he operated his vehicle prior to the
conclusion of the suspension for his DWI
offense.

<CN>I.

<P20>On June 23, 2021, Wildwood Crest Police
observed defendant's car swerving over
the traffic lanes. An officer conducted a
motor vehicle stop and requested defendant's
credentials. Defendant informed the
officer he did not have his license because
it was suspended in Pennsylvania for a
prior DWI conviction.<fnr1> Defendant
<SPage 5>
was
subsequently arrested for DWI<fnr2> and for
violating N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b).

<P20>Defendant has a litany of prior driving
offenses dating back to 1999. Between
2001 and 2014, defendant was convicted of
four DWI offenses. During this same period,
he was also convicted of numerous
other motor vehicle violations and criminal
offenses including reckless driving, driving
while suspended (multiple offenses), chemical
test refusal, speeding, failure to maintain
an ignition interlock, possession of a
controlled substance, and fleeing from police.<fnr3>
These convictions all resulted in license
suspensions of varying durations,
making him ineligible for restoration of his
driving privileges until at least August
2030.<fnr4>

<P20>A grand jury indicted defendant for
"knowingly ... operat[ing] a motor vehicle
during [the] period of license suspension in
violation of [N.J.S.A] 39:3-40, while his license
was suspended for a second or subsequent
violation of [N.J.S.A.] 39:4-50,"
thus violating N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b). Defendant
filed a motion to dismiss the indictment
prior to trial, asserting that the element
of N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b) requiring the
offense to have occurred during a DWI-related
license suspension was not met
because, at the time of the offense, his
license was suspended for a non-DWI-related
violation. Specifically, defendant asserted
he was serving a suspension for an
August 2006 out-of-state conviction for
fleeing from police. The State countered
that the indictment should stand as defendant
was, at the time of the offense, court-ordered
to serve multiple DWI-related
suspensions, making the time of sentencing
<SPage 6>
the effective date of suspension under
the statute, regardless of the actual date
defendant commenced service of the suspension
period.

<P20>The trial court issued a written opinion
denying defendant's motion. The court
held the "indictment should not be dismissed
simply because the offense for
which [defendant's] license was suspended
on the date of his arrest was not a DWI,
when he was already sentenced to two<fnr5>
future license suspensions for DWIs." It
further ruled "it would defeat the Legislature's
<Page 156>
intent" in enacting N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b)
"to dismiss the charges ... simply
because [defendant's] DWI suspensions
had not yet begun," and defendant's license
was "suspended from the time of
sentencing," and thus "suspended for
D[W]I at the time of th[e] offense, even
though [defendant] was still serving non-D[W]I
suspensions."

<P20>The trial began in April 2023. After
opening statements, defendant pled guilty
to N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b) and the other motor
vehicle violations, reserving his right to
appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss
the indictment.<fnr6>

<P20>This appeal followed.

<CN>II.

<P20>Defendant raises the following point on
appeal:

<B22>THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD HAVE
GRANTED THE MOTION TO DISMISS
THE INDICTMENT BECAUSE
[DEFENDANT] WAS NOT SERVING
A DWI-LICENSE SUSPENSION
WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.
<SPage 7>

<P20>"At the grand jury stage, the
State is not required to present enough
evidence to sustain a conviction." <EMU>State v.
Feliciano</EMU>, 224 N.J. 351, 380, 132 A.3d 1245
(2016). "As long as the State presents
`some evidence establishing each element
of the crime to make out a prima facie
case,' a trial court should not dismiss an
indictment." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> (quoting <EMU>State v. Saavedra</EMU>,
222 N.J. 39, 57, 117 A.3d 1169 (2015)).

<P20>A trial court's denial of a motion
to dismiss an indictment is reviewed for an
abuse of discretion and should be reversed
on appeal only if it clearly appears that the
court abused its discretion. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>; <EMU>see also
State v. Bell</EMU>, 241 N.J. 552, 561, 230 A.3d
219 (2020); <EMU>State v. Twiggs</EMU>, 233 N.J. 513,
544, 187 A.3d 123 (2018). "[A]n indictment
should be disturbed only on the `clearest
and plainest ground[s],' and `only when the
indictment is manifestly deficient or palpably
defective.'" <EMU>State v. Shaw</EMU>, 241 N.J.
223, 239, 227 A.3d 279 (2020) (first quoting
<EMU>State v. Perry</EMU>, 124 N.J. 128, 168, 590 A.2d

<P20>Defendant principally argues the State
failed to demonstrate&mdash;at the time of the
offense&mdash;he was driving while serving a
DWI-related license suspension. He concedes
he had "multiple suspensions
<SPage 8>
stacked on top of each other for various
reasons." However, he asserts his license
was suspended at the time of his arrest
based on the 2006 fleeing from police
<Page 157>
charge. Specifically, defendant contends,
"[w]hile [the] DWI suspensions both precede
and succeed the fleeing police suspension,
they were not the reason ... [he]
could not drive on June 23, 2021."

<P20>Defendant maintains the trial court's
ruling that his license was in fact suspended
for DWI, even though he was still serving
a non-DWI suspension, was based on a
misreading of <EMU>State v. Cuccurullo</EMU>, 228 N.J.
Super. 517, 520, 550 A.2d 500 (App. Div.
1988). Defendant contends the trial court
should have relied on <EMU>State v. Perry</EMU>, 439
N.J. Super. 514, 110 A.3d 122 (App. Div.
2015), which he asserts is "the definitive
case on this issue, which holds that
N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26 only applies when a defendant
drives while serving a DWI-license
suspension."

<CN>B.

<P20>The interpretation of a statute is a
legal question. <EMU>State v. Revie</EMU>, 220 N.J. 126,
132, 104 A.3d 221 (2014). "As such, we
review the dispute de novo, unconstrained
by deference to the decisions of the trial
court...." <EMU>State v. Grate</EMU>, 220 N.J. 317,
329, 106 A.3d 466 (2015); <EMU>see also State v.
Hubbard</EMU>, 222 N.J. 249, 263, 118 A.3d 314
(2015).

<P20>When we interpret a statute, "[t]he
overriding goal is to determine as best we
can the intent of the Legislature, and to
give effect to that intent." <EMU>State v. Robinson</EMU>,
217 N.J. 594, 604, 92 A.3d 656 (2014)
(quoting <EMU>State v. Hudson</EMU>, 209 N.J. 513,
529, 39 A.3d 150 (2012)). This review requires

<B22>[w]e begin by "read[ing] and examin[ing]
the text of the act and draw[ing]
inferences concerning the meaning from
its composition and structure." 2A Norman
J. Singer & J.D. Shambie Singer,
<EMU>Sutherland Statutory Construction</EMU>
&sect; 47:1 (7th ed. 2007). That common
sense canon of statutory construction is
reflected also in the legislative directive
codified at N.J.S.A. 1:1-1:

<B44>In the construction of the laws and
statutes of this state, both civil and
criminal, words and phrases shall be
read and construed with their context,
and shall, unless inconsistent with the
manifest intent of the [L]egislature or
unless
<SPage 9>
another or different meaning
is expressly indicated, be given their
generally accepted meaning, according
to the approved usage of the language.

<B22>If a plain-language reading of the statute
"leads to a clear and unambiguous
result, then our interpretive process is
over." <EMU>Richardson v. Bd. of Trs., Police
& Firemen's Ret. Sys.</EMU>, 192 N.J. 189,
195-96 [927 A.2d 543] (2007).

<B22>[<EMU>State v. Hupka</EMU>, 203 N.J. 222, 231-32, 1
A.3d 640 (2010) (alterations in original).]

<P20>When reviewing a statute's plain
language, we do not parse its provisions.
Rather, we consider "not only the particular
statute in question, but also the entire
legislative scheme of which it is a part."
<EMU>State v. Olivero</EMU>, 221 N.J. 632, 639, 115
A.3d 1270 (2015) (quoting <EMU>Kimmelman v.
Henkels & McCoy, Inc.</EMU>, 108 N.J. 123, 129,
527 A.2d 1368 (1987)).

<P20>If our review finds an ambiguity in
the statutory language, we then turn to
extrinsic evidence. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> When such evidence
is needed, we look to a variety of
sources, "such as the statute's purpose,
legislative history, and statutory context to
ascertain the [L]egislature's intent." <EMU>State
v. Thomas</EMU>, 166 N.J. 560, 567, 767 A.2d 459
(2001) (quoting <EMU>Aponte-Correa v. Allstate
Ins. Co.</EMU>, 162 N.J. 318, 323, 744 A.2d 175
(2000)). <EMU>See also State v. Crawley</EMU>, 187 N.J.
440, 453, 901 A.2d 924 (2006) (resorting to
legislative history and related statutes as
extrinsic aids to interpret the statute).
<Page 158>

<B22>Where a criminal statute defining a
crime is at issue, language "susceptible
of differing constructions," must be interpreted
"to further" the "general purposes"
stated in N.J.S.A. 2C:1-2(a) and
the "special purposes" of the provision
at issue. N.J.S.A. 2C:1-2(a), (c). Most
important here is the Code's purpose of
giving "fair warning of the nature of the
conduct proscribed," N.J.S.A. 2C:1-2(a)(4).
Fair notice of prohibited conduct
is the fundamental principle underlying
the rule of construction calling for resolution
of ambiguities in criminal statutes
against the State. <EMU>State v. Gelman</EMU>, 195
N.J. 475, 482 [950 A.2d 879] (2008).

<B22>[<EMU>State v. J.B.W.</EMU>, 434 N.J. Super. 550,
554, 85 A.3d 1010 (App. Div. 2014).]

<P20>Also, "[w]hen the text of a statute
and extrinsic aids do not enlighten us satisfactorily
concerning the Legislature's intent,
our obligation is to construe the statute
strictly, against the State and in favor
of the defendant." <EMU>State v. Reiner</EMU>, 180 N.J.
307, 318, 850 A.2d 1252 (2004). That said,
"[e]ven a penal statute should not be construed
to reach a ridiculous or absurd result."
<EMU>State v. Wrotny</EMU>, 221 N.J. Super. 226,
229, 534 A.2d 87 (App. Div. 1987) (citing
<EMU>State v. Gill</EMU>, 47 N.J. 441, 444, 221 A.2d 521
(1966)).
<SPage 10>

<P20>Against this backdrop, we turn to the
statutory provision at issue in this matter.
N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b), in pertinent part,
provides:

<B22>It shall be a crime of the fourth degree
to operate a motor vehicle <EMU>during the
period of license suspension</EMU> in violation
of [N.J.S.A.] 39:3-40, [driving with a suspended
license], if the actor's license was
suspended or revoked <EMU>for a second or
subsequent violation</EMU> of [N.J.S.A.] 39:4-50
.... A person convicted of an offense
under this subsection shall be sentenced
by the court to a term of imprisonment.

<B22>[(Emphasis added).]

<P00>In adopting the statute,

<B22>the Legislature stiffened the sanction
for driving with a license suspended or
revoked due to multiple prior DWI or
refusal convictions. Before the enactment
of N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b), such an
offender only faced the sanctions that
are set forth outside of the Criminal
Code in N.J.S.A. 39:3-40(f)(2), a provision
that authorizes a jail term of between
ten and ninety days. By contrast,
fourth-degree crimes are generally punishable
by a custodial term of up to
eighteen months, N.J.S.A. 2C:43-6(a)(4),
and, moreover, N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b) expressly
carries a mandatory minimum
penalty of 180 days in prison.

<B22>[<EMU>State v. Carrigan</EMU>, 428 N.J. Super. 609,
613-14, 55 A.3d 87 (App. Div. 2012).]

<P20>"The significantly enhanced consequences
to driving while suspended were
the legislative response to `reports of fatal
or serious accidents that had been caused
by recidivist offenders with multiple prior
DWI violations.'" <EMU>Perry</EMU>, 439 N.J. Super.
at 523, 110 A.3d 122 (quoting <EMU>Carrigan</EMU>, 428
N.J. Super. at 614, 55 A.3d 87).

<P20>We initially note that defendant's reliance
on <EMU>Perry</EMU> is unavailing. In <EMU>Perry</EMU>, we
held that N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26 "criminalizes
the operation of a motor vehicle only while
the operator is serving the court-imposed
term of suspension, and not thereafter."
439 N.J. Super. at 519, 110 A.3d 122. However,
we did not decide the issue before us
in this matter&mdash;whether N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b)
criminalizes driving when a license
suspension for a second or subsequent
DWI offense has been ordered but is delayed
from running due to a defendant's
stacked suspensions. Rather, in <EMU>Perry</EMU> we
addressed only "those driving without reinstatement
beyond the court-imposed
term of suspension." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 525, 110 A.3d
122.
<Page 159>

<P20>The State in <EMU>Perry</EMU> argued that
"N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26 must be interpreted to
mean that ... individual[s] can be charged
until [they] pay[] the requisite license restoration
fees, compl[y] with
<SPage 11>
all administrative
requirements, and [are] reinstated.
..." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 523, 110 A.3d 122. We rejected
this argument and held that N.J.S.A.
2C:40-26(b) "was intended to apply only
when the actor is `under suspension for
those offenses,'" or "while serving the
court-imposed term of suspension." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at
527, 110 A.3d 122 (italicization omitted).
However, we noted the statute "is silent
about drivers under continuing administrative
suspension who did not restore their
privileges after being convicted of DWI
offenses and completing their determinate
suspension terms." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> We further observed
the statute "punishes those who
drive while suspended for violations of the
DWI ... law ... when they drive during
the court-imposed period of suspension,"
and it was not intended to criminalize
"driving during a period of administrative
suspension" when driving privileges could
have been restored but for the defendant's
failure to complete the process for administrative
restoration. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 531-32, 110
A.3d 122.

<P20>Here, defendant, unlike the defendants
in <EMU>Perry</EMU>, was not driving during a
period of administrative suspension after
having completed his court-ordered suspension.
Rather, he had not yet completed
his suspension term for the most recent of
his four DWIs. It would be illogical for
defendant to avoid a conviction for violating
N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b), in light of defendant's
four prior DWIs, merely because
the court-ordered suspension for his latest
DWI had not yet commenced because he
incurred multiple other intervening license
suspensions.

<P20>We conclude operation "during the period
of license suspension" under N.J.S.A.
2C:40-26(b) includes driving after an imposed
suspension of driving privileges for
a second or subsequent DWI, which has
not commenced because of stacked or yet-to-be-served
prior suspensions. The language
of the statute does not require defendant
to be serving a suspension associated
with a particular DWI offense at the
time he was operating his vehicle. Rather,
the statute makes it a crime to operate
"during the period of license suspension
... if the actor's license was suspended
... for a second or subsequent" DWI offense.
<SPage 12>

<P20>Here, it is undisputed defendant's
driving privileges were, in fact, suspended
for a second or subsequent DWI violation
&mdash;along with a number of other suspensions
&mdash;despite his serving a suspension
for a prior criminal offense when he was
arrested. Because defendant operated his
vehicle while his license was suspended for
a "second or subsequent" DWI, which had
not yet been served, he was properly
charged with violating N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b).

<P20>Moreover, defendant's interpretation of
N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b) is inconsistent with
the Legislature's goal in enacting the statute,
which was designed to punish recidivist
drunk drivers. Defendant's interpretation
would defeat the legislative objective
of the statute and allow defendant to avoid
the penalties set forth in the statute based
solely on the fact he had multiple other
suspensions.

<P20>In the context of applying the enhanced
penalties under N.J.S.A. 39:3-40 for driving
while suspended for DWI, we previously
determined a defendant is "`under suspension'
from the time that the suspension
is imposed even though the period of suspension
may not begin until later." <EMU>Cuccurullo</EMU>,
228 N.J. Super. at 520, 550 A.2d 500.
The defendant in <EMU>Cuccurullo</EMU> asserted that
the enhanced penalties should not apply to
<Page 160>
him "because when he committed the present
offense, his DWI suspension period
had not begun and therefore he was not a
`person ... under suspension issued pursuant
to [N.J.S.A.] 39:4-50.'" <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> (quoting
N.J.S.A. 39:3-40(f)(2)). We disagreed, stating
that "[a] person is `under suspension'
from the time that the suspension is imposed
even though the period of suspension
may not begin until later." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> We
further observed:

<B22>Were defendant's argument accepted,
the more unserved suspension time a
driver has accumulated before his DWI
suspension is imposed, the longer thereafter
he could continue to drive before
being subject to the [driving while suspended]
statute's enhanced penalties.
We may not attribute to the Legislature
an intent to produce such an absurd
result.

<B22>[<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 521, 550 A.2d 500.]

<P20>We adopt here the rationale we utilized
in <EMU>Cuccurullo</EMU>. We are unpersuaded by defendant's
argument that, essentially, he
could only be convicted of violating
N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b) beginning in
<SPage 13>
the
year 2027 for his most recent DWI because
only then would his other non-DWI
suspensions end and his already-imposed
fourth DWI suspension commence. This
argument would lead to an anomalous result
and reward defendant for accumulating
a multitude of other suspensions. We
hold that when defendants drive while suspended
for second or subsequent DWIs,
they are subject to the penalties of
N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b) during the pendency
of any other suspensions until the actual
completion of their DWI-related suspensions.

<P20>Defendant attempts to distinguish <EMU>Cuccurullo</EMU>
because it was "in the context of
applying motor vehicle penalties" rather
than criminal penalties under N.J.S.A.
2C:40-26. This distinction is immaterial in
the present context, as the crux of the
<EMU>Cuccurullo</EMU> decision was to determine the
meaning of "under suspension issued pursuant
to [N.J.S.A] 39:4-50." <EMU>Cuccurullo</EMU>, 228
N.J. Super. at 520, 550 A.2d 500 (quoting
N.J.S.A. 39:3-40).

<P20>Like the statutory language interpreted
in <EMU>Cuccurullo</EMU>, N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b)'s language
addresses conduct occurring "`during
the period of license suspension' ... if
the actor's license was suspended ... for a
second or subsequent violation of
[N.J.S.A.] 39:4-50...." N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b).
The statutes' shared purpose is "to
discourage [individuals] from driving from
the moment [their] DWI license suspension[s]
[are] imposed until after [they]
ha[ve] served the DWI suspension." <EMU>Cuccurullo</EMU>,
228 N.J. Super. at 521, 550 A.2d
500. The Supreme Court noted there is no
meaningful distinction between the language
in the two statutes, because "[a]lthough
N.J.S.A 39:3-40 and N.J.S.A.
2C:40-26 are not found within the same
title of the Code, they operate in tandem
to establish escalating consequences for
the same conduct&mdash;driving while suspended
&mdash;based on a defendant's number of past
DWI or Refusal convictions." <EMU>State v. Konecny</EMU>,
250 N.J. 321, 337, 271 A.3d 1266
(2022)

<P20>Our interpretation of N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b)
is also guided by the Legislature's
intent to prevent "fatal or serious accidents
that had been caused by recidivist
offenders with multiple prior DWI
<SPage 14>
violations, who nevertheless were driving
with a suspended license[,]" <EMU>Carrigan</EMU>, 428
N.J. Super. at 614, 55 A.3d 87 (citing <EMU>Assemb.
Comm. Report to A.4303</EMU> (Jan. 11,
2010)), but also to avoid an irrational result.
<EMU>See State v. Haliski</EMU>, 140 N.J. 1, 9, 656
A.2d 1246 (1995) ("[W]hatever be the rule
of [statutory] construction, it is subordinate
to the goal of effectuating the legislative
plan as it may be gathered from the
enactment `when read in full light of its
<Page 161>
history, purpose and context.'" (quoting
<EMU>Gill</EMU>, 47 N.J. at 444, 221 A.2d 521 (alterations
in original))).

<P20>Defendant's interpretation of
N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b) would allow a defendant
under suspension with multiple DWI
convictions to avoid the custodial penalty
intended by the Legislature simply because
of a significant prior history of suspensions
that must be served and completed
before the DWI-related suspension
period. We decline to adopt this cramped
reading of the statute. A defendant completing
service of a license suspension
term for a prior traffic or criminal offense,
which precluded the commencement of an
imposed license suspension following multiple
convictions for DWI, is subject to
N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26 and the criminal penalties
intended to punish such conduct.

<P20>Based on the foregoing reasons, we affirm
the trial court's order denying defendant's
motion to dismiss the indictment. To
the extent we have not otherwise addressed
defendant's arguments, they are
without sufficient merit to warrant discussion
in a written opinion. <EMU>R.</EMU> 2:11-3(e)(2).

<P20>Affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt1> New Jersey refers to the offense as driving
while intoxicated. Pennsylvania, where defendant's
motor vehicle convictions originated,
refers to the offense as driving under the
influence or DUI. For the purposes of clarity,
we use the acronym DWI in this appeal.

<fnt2> N.J.S.A. 39:4-50.

<fnt3> All of these offenses, including defendant's
prior DWIs, were from Pennsylvania.

<fnt4> That does not include the twelve-year license
suspension imposed in this case.

<fnt5> It appears defendant was subject to only
one future license suspension. Regardless, defendant
had already compiled three prior
DWI convictions, thereby implicating N.J.S.A.
2C:40-26(b)'s "second or subsequent" DWI-related
suspension provision.

<fnt6> Defendant was sentenced to one year imprisonment
with a mandatory six-month period
of parole ineligibility on his violation of
N.J.S.A. 2C:40-26(b). As to defendant's DWI
incurred on the same date, the court sentenced
defendant to an additional 180-day
term of imprisonment to run concurrently.
The court also imposed an additional twelve-year
license suspension.

<Page 164>

<CN>I.

<P20>In 2014, a grand jury indicted defendant
and two co-defendants, Thomas D'Anna
and Julio Concepcion, for their participation
in a mortgage fraud scheme involving
two fraudulent real estate sales
<SPage 20>
transactions. The indictment charged the
defendants with: (1) first-degree conspiracy
to commit money laundering and/or
theft by deception, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2,
N.J.S.A. 2C:21-25(b)(2)(a), and N.J.S.A.
2C:20-4(a) (count one); (2) first-degree
money laundering, N.J.S.A. 2C:21-25(b)(2)(a)
(count two); and (3) second-degree
theft by deception, N.J.S.A. 2C:20-4(a)
(count three).

<P20>The transactions concerned properties
owned by D'Anna on which there were
outstanding mortgages. The sales prices
exceeded the mortgage balances. Defendant,
then a licensed attorney, acted as the
closing agent. She lied on Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
closing statements by, among other things,
falsely claiming to have received deposits
from the purchasers and to have placed
those deposits in her escrow account. In
fact, the purchasers did not exist. Concepcion
had obtained stolen identities and created
fraudulent financial documents to obtain
loans to straw purchasers to finance
contracts to buy D'Anna's properties.

<P20>At the closings, a portion of the loan
proceeds were used to satisfy the existing
mortgages on D'Anna's properties. The remainder
of the loan proceeds were distributed
to D'Anna and Concepcion, who submitted
fake invoices for renovations he
falsely claimed to have performed at the
properties. While defendant did not receive
any of the loan proceeds, she was
paid for acting as counsel at the closings.
After making a few payments on the loans
in the names of the straw purchasers,
D'Anna and Concepcion abandoned the
loans, allowing them to default, which ultimately
resulted in foreclosures.

<P20>Defendant was tried separately. She denied
having engaged in a conspiracy and
testified she was hired to represent the
purchasers in the two transactions unaware
of the underlying scheme, stolen
identities, fraudulent financial documents,
or fraudulent renovation invoices. D'Anna
entered a guilty plea to second-degree conspiracy.
In exchange for the State's recommendation
that he receive a probationary
sentence, D'Anna agreed to testify at defendant's
trial. At trial, D'Anna denied
knowing Concepcion had obtained
<SPage 21>
stolen
identities or created fraudulent financial
documents. He admitted, however, he and
defendant entered into an agreement to lie
on the HUD statements in order to secure
the two loans necessary to complete the
closings.

<P20>Defense counsel sought to cross-examine
D'Anna about the sentencing exposure he
faced when he entered into his plea agreement.
Specifically, he attempted to question
D'Anna about the potential twenty-year
maximum prison sentence he faced on
the charges in the indictment, as well as a
third fraudulent transaction for which he,
but not defendant, was indicted. The court,
however, limited cross-examination of
D'Anna to the seven-year prison sentence
recommended by the State in its first plea
offer. The court noted D'Anna, as a first-time
offender, was unlikely to receive the
maximum sentence on all charges if convicted
at trial. Thus, the court concluded,
reference to a potential twenty-year maximum
prison sentence would not reflect
D'Anna's actual sentencing exposure and
could mislead the jury.

<P20>In addition, the court expressed concern
that questions about D'Anna's maximum
sentencing exposure would inform the jury
of defendant's maximum sentencing exposure
because the two were charged with
<Page 165>
the same crimes. The court permitted defense
counsel to explore all other aspects
of D'Anna's plea agreement, including that
his counsel negotiated the State's initial
offer from a seven-year prison term to a
probationary sentence.

<P20>Concepcion also testified at trial. He admitted
he was involved in the mortgage
fraud and said D'Anna was a full-fledged
co-conspirator from the formation of the
scheme. Concepcion testified that he had
never met defendant and did not conspire
with her.

<P20>The jury convicted defendant of lesser-included
offenses charged in each count of
the indictment: second-degree conspiracy
on count one; second-degree money laundering
on count two; and second-degree
theft by deception on count three. Defendant
moved for a new trial, arguing,
among other things, that the court's limitation
on her cross-examination of D'Anna
resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The
trial court denied the motion and
<SPage 22>
sentenced defendant to an aggregate
four-year term of imprisonment.

<P20>On direct appeal, defendant argued, in
part, that her Sixth Amendment rights
were infringed when the trial court prohibited
her counsel from questioning D'Anna
about his full sentencing exposure prior to
accepting the plea agreement. We rejected
defendant's Sixth Amendment argument:

<B22>The court balanced defendant's right to
confront the witness on his expectation
of favorable treatment from the State in
return for his testimony with the State's
right to be free from prejudicial and
potential[ly] confusing evidence regarding
the maximum exposure on the
charges D'Anna originally faced. As the
court concluded, D'Anna did not realistically
face a twenty-year sentence. The
State initiated plea negotiations by offering
him a recommended seven-year
term. In addition, as a first-time offender
[D'Anna] was unlikely to receive the
maximum sentence on each of the counts
were he to have been found guilty at
trial. The limitation imposed by the
court did not prevent defendant from
using cross-examination for the desired
purpose of questioning D'Anna's credibility
by suggesting the State may have
influenced his testimony through favorable
resolution of his pending criminal
charges.

<B22>[<EMU>State v. Hand</EMU>, No. A-0516-17 (App. Div.
Aug. 14, 2019) (slip op. at 18), 2019 WL
3812415.]

<P20>We reversed defendant's conviction of
money laundering on other grounds, affirmed
her remaining convictions, and remanded
for resentencing. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 19. On
May 26, 2020, the trial court resentenced
defendant.

<P20>On July 2, 2020, the Supreme Court
issued its opinion in <EMU>Jackson</EMU>. In that case,
the Court addressed "whether a defendant
facing the same charges as a cooperating
witness should be barred from exploring
that adverse witness's sentencing exposure."
243 N.J. at 58, 233 A.3d 440. Defense
counsel in <EMU>Jackson</EMU> sought to elicit
testimony that the cooperating co-defendant
would have been exposed to a sentencing
range of three to five years when
the State offered to recommend a prison
term of three years in exchange for his
cooperation and testimony against Jackson.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU> It was later determined that the
cooperating co-defendant was extended-term
eligible due to prior convictions and
faced up to ten years in prison had the
prosecutor sought the extended term. <EMU>Id.</EMU>
at 70, 233 A.3d 440.
<SPage 23>

<P20>The court ultimately urged modification
of the plea agreement, resulting in the
State agreeing to recommend a probationary
term conditioned on 180 days in jail.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU> The trial court precluded questioning
<Page 166>
regarding the co-defendant's maximum exposure
because it believed the jury would
infer that Jackson faced the same exposure
and be more reluctant to convict him
as a result. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 59, 62, 233 A.3d 440. The
trial court thus permitted testimony only
about the length of the sentences recommended
in the initial plea offer and the
final agreement, not the maximum exposure.
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 59, 233 A.3d 440.

<P20>Before the Supreme Court, Jackson argued
the limitation on cross-examination of
the cooperating co-defendant deprived him
of his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU> In considering this argument,
the Court weighed defendant's confrontation
right against the concern the jury
would find the defendant not guilty if it
inferred his sentencing exposure from the
elicited testimony. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 69, 233 A.3d 440.
The Court held "the jury should have had
full access to [the cooperating co-defendant's]
plea agreement history through the
defense counsel's unfettered examination
of that history" and found the cross-examination
limitations violated Jackson's rights
to confrontation and a fair trial. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 59,
74, 233 A.3d 440.

<P20>Instead of limiting the cross-examination,
the Court explained, the trial court
should have instructed the jury "not to
speculate about or consider a defendant's
potential sentence when deciding whether
the State has proven the charges alleged
beyond a reasonable doubt." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 71, 233
A.3d 440. The Court did "not favor a process
in which trial judges perform a generalized
gatekeeping function and try to
decide whether cross-examination would
adequately convey enough information
about a witness's credibility without allowing
questions about the witness's sentencing
range." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 72, 233 A.3d 440.

<P20>The Court, however, noted "there is still
a place for objections under N.J.R.E.
403[,]" <EMU>ibid.</EMU>, which provides that "relevant
evidence may be excluded if its probative
value is substantially
<SPage 24>
outweighed by the
risk of ... [u]ndue prejudice, confusion of
issues, or misleading the jury...."
N.J.R.E. 403. For example, the Court noted
a trial court "could properly curtail"
cross-examination suggesting "a witness
would receive consecutive sentences on
multiple counts that would instead merge
at sentencing...." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>The Court went on to consider whether
the error was harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 72-74, 233 A.3d 440. The
Court found that if the jury had known the
co-defendant was actually facing an extended
term of ten years but negotiated a
probationary term in exchange for his testimony,
it might have believed this key
witness for the State was biased. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 73-74,
233 A.3d 440. The Court emphasized
the defendant had a right to ask the co-defendant
about his subjective understanding
of his maximum sentencing exposure
and thereby fully demonstrate the co-defendant's
potential bias. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 73, 233 A.3d
440. The Court could not conclude beyond
a reasonable doubt that the limitation on
the cross-examination was harmless. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at
74, 233 A.3d 440. Because the Confrontation
Clause error denied Jackson a fair
trial, his conviction was reversed, and the
case was remanded for a new trial. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>On September 9, 2020, defendant moved
for reconsideration of our opinion affirming
in part and reversing in part her convictions.
She argued the holding in <EMU>Jackson</EMU>
applied retroactively and warranted
reversal of her convictions in light of the
limitations imposed on her cross-examination
of D'Anna. We denied the motion,
noting defendant could assert a claim for
retroactive application of <EMU>Jackson</EMU> through
a petition for PCR. <EMU>State v. Hand</EMU>, No. A-0516-17
<Page 167>
(App. Div. Oct. 15, 2020).<fnr1>
<SPage 25>

<P20>Defendant thereafter filed a PCR petition
seeking retroactive application of the
holding in <EMU>Jackson</EMU>. On March 27, 2023, the
PCR court issued a written decision denying
defendant's petition. The court accepted
the parties' agreement that <EMU>Jackson</EMU>
announced a new rule with respect to the
cross-examination of a cooperating co-defendant.
In addition, the court concluded
the new rule was designed to enhance the
reliability of the truth-finding process.

<P20>The court found, however, the rule <EMU>Jackson</EMU>
replaced did not substantially impair
the accuracy of the truth-finding process
because defendants had the opportunity to
cross-examine cooperating co-defendants
about the terms of their plea agreements,
albeit in a more limited manner than is
available under <EMU>Jackson</EMU>. As an example,
the PCR court noted defendant's cross-examination
of D'Anna under the old rule
elicited detailed testimony about his plea
agreement, including multiple mentions
that his testimony was a key condition of
the State's offer to reduce his sentence
from a recommended seven years in prison
to probation. Through this testimony, the
court found, defendant was able to sufficiently
explore D'Anna's possible bias and
motivation to testify falsely.

<P20>The PCR court also found there was
little likelihood of untrustworthy evidence
admitted under the old rule because cross-examination
under the old rule, while more
limited than permitted under the new rule,
did not elicit untrue information. In addition,
the court found the State had long
relied on the old rule, given the long-standing
practice of permitting limitations
on cross-examination of cooperating co-defendants
with respect to their sentencing
exposure.

<P20>Finally, the court found complete retroactive
application of <EMU>Jackson</EMU> would have a
significant detrimental effect on the administration
of justice. The record does not
establish the number of convictions to
which <EMU>Jackson</EMU> would apply if fully retroactive.
However, the PCR court found the
use of cooperating witnesses is common in
multi-defendant cases, and longstanding,
noting the issue was addressed by the
Supreme Court as early as 1954 in
<SPage 26>
<EMU>State
v. Spruill</EMU>, 16 N.J. 73, 75-81, 106 A.2d 278.
This factor, the court found, weighed
against complete retroactivity.

<P20>After weighing these factors, the PCR
court concluded complete retroactive application
of <EMU>Jackson</EMU> was not warranted. In
light of that conclusion, the court denied
defendant's petition.<fnr2> A March 27, 2023
order memorialized the PCR court's decision.

<P20>This appeal followed. Defendant argues:

<B22>THE PCR COURT ERRED WHEN IT
DENIED DEFENDANT'S APPLICATION
TO HAVE THE NEW RULE
OF LAW ANNOUNCED IN <EMU>STATE V.
JACKSON</EMU>, 243 N.J. 52 [233 A.3d 440]
(2020)[,] APPLIED RETROACTIVELY
TO THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF
<Page 168>
THE STATE'S ONLY WITNESS TO
TESTIFY AS TO CULPABILITY ON
THE PART OF THE DEFENDANT.

<CN>II.

<P20>Under <EMU>Rule</EMU> 3:22-2(a), a defendant
is entitled to PCR if there was a
"[s]ubstantial denial in the conviction proceedings
of defendant's rights under the
Constitution of the United States or the
Constitution or laws of the State of New
Jersey...." "A petitioner must establish
the right to such relief by a preponderance
of the credible evidence." <EMU>State v. Preciose</EMU>,
129 N.J. 451, 459, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992).
"To sustain that burden, specific facts"
which "would provide the court with an
adequate basis on which to rest its decision"
must be articulated. <EMU>State v. Mitchell</EMU>,
126 N.J. 565, 579, 601 A.2d 198 (1992).

<P20>We review a judge's decision to
deny a PCR petition without an evidentiary
hearing for abuse of discretion. <EMU>State v.
Brewster</EMU>, 429 N.J. Super. 387, 401, 58
A.3d 1234 (App. Div. 2013) (citing <EMU>State v.
Marshall</EMU>, 148 N.J. 89, 157-58, 690 A.2d 1
(1997)).
<SPage 27>
We review the court's legal conclusion
de novo. <EMU>State v. Harris</EMU>, 181 N.J.
391, 419, 859 A.2d 364 (2004).

<P20>Defendant argues she is entitled to PCR
because her Sixth Amendment rights, as
recognized in <EMU>Jackson</EMU>, were curtailed by
the trial court's limitations on her cross-examination
of D'Anna. To benefit from
the holding in <EMU>Jackson</EMU>, defendant must
establish that the decision has retroactive
effect.

<P20>To determine whether and to
what extent a holding will be applied retroactively,
we must first decide if it "announced"
"a new rule of law." <EMU>State v.
G.E.P.</EMU>, 243 N.J. 362, 382, 235 A.3d 157
(2020) (quoting <EMU>State v. Feal</EMU>, 194 N.J. 293,
307, 944 A.2d 599 (2008)). "A new rule
exists if `it breaks new ground or ... if the
result was not <EMU>dictated</EMU> by precedent existing
at the time the defendant's conviction
became final.'" <EMU>Feal</EMU>, 194 N.J. at 308, 944
A.2d 599 (quoting <EMU>State v. Lark</EMU>, 117 N.J.
331, 339, 567 A.2d 197 (1989) (internal
quotations omitted)). "Obviously, where a
new rule is not at issue, a retroactivity
inquiry is unnecessary." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>The parties agree that <EMU>Jackson</EMU> created
a new rule with respect to the scope of
cross-examination of a cooperating co-defendant.
We see no reason to disagree with
the parties' position.

<P20>In light of the determination <EMU>Jackson</EMU>
announced a new rule, "[t]here are
four options: (1) prospective application,
(2) application `in future cases and in the
case in which the rule is announced,' (3)
"`pipeline retroactivity," rendering it applicable
in all future cases, the case in
which the rule was announced, and any
cases still on direct appeal,' or (4) `complete
retroactive effect.'" <EMU>G.E.P.</EMU>, 243 N.J.
at 386, 235 A.3d 157 (quoting <EMU>State v.
Knight</EMU>, 145 N.J. 233, 249, 678 A.2d 642
(1996) (internal quotations omitted)).

<P20>Because defendant's direct appeal
of her convictions was completed prior to
the issuance of <EMU>Jackson</EMU>, she is entitled to
relief only if complete retroactivity applies
to its holding. Three questions influence
our determination of the extent to which
<EMU>Jackson</EMU> will apply retroactively: "(1) the
purpose of the rule and whether it would
be furthered by a retroactive application,
(2) the degree of
<SPage 28>
reliance placed on the
old rule by those who administered it, and
(3) the effect a retroactive application
would have on the administration of justice."
<EMU>State v. Henderson</EMU>, 208 N.J. 208,
300, 27 A.3d 872 (2011) (quoting <EMU>Knight</EMU>,
145 N.J. at 251, 678 A.2d 642). "We do not
accord those factors `equal weight.'"
<EMU>G.E.P.</EMU>, 243 N.J. at 386, 235 A.3d 157
(quoting <EMU>Henderson</EMU>, 208 N.J. at 301, 27
A.3d 872). "The first factor, the purpose of
the new rule, is often the pivotal consideration."
<Page 169>
<EMU>State v. Burstein</EMU>, 85 N.J. 394, 406,
427 A.2d 525 (1981).

<P20>A new rule's purpose falls into
one of three categories. "First, `a new rule
may be intended solely to deter police
misconduct. In such a case, retroactivity
would almost certainly be denied because
the new rule's deterrent purpose would not
be advanced by retroactive application to
past misconduct.'" <EMU>State v. J.A.</EMU>, 398 N.J.
Super. 511, 520, 942 A.2d 149 (App. Div.
2008) (quoting <EMU>State v. Purnell</EMU>, 161 N.J.
44, 54, 735 A.2d 513 (1999)). Second,
"where the purpose of the new rule `is to
overcome an aspect of the criminal trial
that <EMU>substantially impairs</EMU> its truth-finding
function' and which raises `serious questions
about the accuracy of guilty verdicts
in past trials'" the first factor points to a
complete retroactive application. <EMU>Burstein</EMU>,
85 N.J. at 406-07, 427 A.2d 525 (quoting
<EMU>Williams v. United States</EMU>, 401 U.S. 646,
653, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971)).
"In between these extremes is a third
category of cases, where the new rule is
designed to enhance the reliability of the
factfinding process but the old rule did not
`substantially' impair the accuracy of that
process." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 408, 427 A.2d 525.

<P20>To determine the extent to which
the old rule impaired the truth-finding process,
we consider "first, the likelihood of
untrustworthy evidence being admitted under
the old rule and, second, whether the
defendant had alternate ways of contesting
the integrity of the evidence being introduced
against" them. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> Second, we balance
"the extent to which the old rule
impaired the reliability of the truth-finding
process" against the "countervailing
<SPage 29>
State reliance on the old rule and the
disruptive effect that retroactivity would
have on the administration of justice."
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>Clearly, the first category is not
implicated here. The scope of permissible
cross-examination of a cooperating co-defendant
is unrelated to police conduct. The
holding in <EMU>Jackson</EMU> addresses the truth-finding
process at trial, given that it is
intended to provide jurors with a broader
range of information on which they may
make a credibility determination with respect
to a cooperating co-defendant.

<P20>We agree with the State's argument that
the rule replaced by <EMU>Jackson</EMU> did not substantially
impair the truth-finding process
at trial. Prior to <EMU>Jackson</EMU>, defendants were
permitted to question cooperating co-defendants
about plea bargain negotiations,
although in a more limited fashion than
required by <EMU>Jackson</EMU>. For example, defendant's
lengthy cross-examination of
D'Anna revealed that he faced a significant
prison sentence which he would likely
avoid by testifying against defendant. The
jurors heard the State's original recommendation
was for a seven-year prison
sentence and D'Anna's counsel negotiated
an agreement for a recommendation of
probation in exchange for D'Anna's cooperation.

<P20>In addition, defendant called Concepcion
as a witness. He cast doubt on D'Anna's
credibility, testifying that D'Anna was a
conspirator in the mortgage fraud from its
inception, contrary to D'Anna's testimony.
Defendant, therefore, used alternate ways
of contesting the integrity of the evidence
being introduced against her through
D'Anna's testimony.

<P20>We also agree that under the old rule
the admission of untrustworthy evidence
was not likely. <EMU>Jackson</EMU> enhances the truth-finding
process by providing jurors with
additional evidence on which to make credibility
determinations. It does not address
a prior practice under which untrustworthy
evidence was likely to be admitted.
The testimony permitted under the old
rule would also be admissible under <EMU>Jackson</EMU>.
The difference under the new rule is
that additional testimony introduced during
cross-examination
<SPage 30>
will assist the triers
of fact in determining the cooperating
<Page 170>
witness's credibility. We agree, therefore,
that the purpose of the new rule militates
against complete retroactivity.

<P20>We reach the same conclusion
with respect to the State's reliance on the
old rule, which was longstanding, and the
impact on the administration of justice that
would result from complete retroactivity.
As the PCR court recognized, co-defendant
cooperation has long been a facet of
multi-defendant trials. It is likely that
complete retroactive application would potentially
disrupt numerous convictions.

<P20>The Court faced similar circumstances
in <EMU>State v. Bellamy</EMU>, 178 N.J. 127, 835 A.2d
1231 (2003). In that case, the Court considered
whether to retroactively apply its
holding that a defendant must be informed
of the possibility of civil commitment under
the New Jersey Sexually Violent Predator
Act (the Act), N.J.S.A. 30:4-27.24 to -27.38,
when entering a guilty plea to certain
predicate offenses. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 131, 835 A.2d
1231. When undertaking its analysis, the
Court noted that trial courts routinely did
not inform defendants of the possibility of
civil commitment before accepting their
pleas, but the number of pleas entered
under such circumstances had not been
established by the parties. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 142, 835
A.2d 1231. The Court held that "[w]hile we
do not know the exact number of defendants
who pled guilty to a predicate offense
without knowing the possible consequences
under the Act ..., we recognize
that full retroactivity of this decision would
have a disruptive effect on the administration
of justice." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> The Court continued,

<B22>[t]he lack of data regarding the number
and kinds of cases that would be affected
by a rule of complete retroactivity
and the impact that complete retroactivity
would have on the administration of
justice mandates that the new rule
should apply only to cases pending direct
review at the time of the rule's
announcement.

<B22>[<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 142-43, 835 A.2d 1231.]

<P00>The Court's reasoning is equally applicable
here.

<P20>We also are not persuaded by defendant's
argument that the holding in <EMU>Jackson</EMU>
is similar to the holdings in <EMU>State v.
Afanador</EMU>, 151 N.J. 41, 59, 697 A.2d 529
(1997), and <EMU>Roberts v. Russell</EMU>, 392
<SPage 31>
U.S.
293, 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100
(1968), where complete retroactivity was
applied.

<P20><EMU>Afanador</EMU> addressed whether the holding
in <EMU>State v. Alexander</EMU>, 136 N.J. 563, 643
A.2d 996 (1994), should apply with complete
retroactivity. In <EMU>Alexander</EMU>, the
Court held that before a "defendant could
be convicted as drug kingpin under
N.J.S.A. 2C:35-3, the jury should be instructed
that it must find the defendant
held an `upper echelon' or `high level' role
as leader of a drug trafficking network."
<EMU>Afanador</EMU>, 151 N.J. at 46, 697 A.2d 529.
The Court held that <EMU>Alexander</EMU> did not
announce a new rule. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 57, 697 A.2d
529. Instead, the Court concluded that <EMU>Alexander</EMU>
clarified ambiguities in a statute
and did not bring about "a `sudden and
generally unanticipated repudiation of a
long-standing practice.'" <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 57-58, 697
A.2d 529 (quoting <EMU>State v. Cupe</EMU>, 289 N.J.
Super. 1, 12, 672 A.2d 1233 (App. Div.
1996)). Thus, a retroactivity analysis was
not necessary. This is a critical distinction,
given that the parties and this court agree
<EMU>Jackson</EMU> announced a new rule.

<P20>In <EMU>dicta</EMU>, the Court held that if <EMU>Alexander</EMU>
were considered to have announced a
new rule, complete retroactivity would apply
to its holding. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 59, 697 A.2d 529.
However, in reaching that conclusion, the
Court noted "[t]here was no definitive case
law regarding the jury instruction prior to
<EMU>Alexander</EMU>. Thus, past reliance is not a
strong argument for precluding retroactive
application." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> In addition, the Court
found that "[t]he third factor, the administration
<Page 171>
of justice, does not appear sufficient
to outweigh the first factor" militating
in favor of complete retroactivity. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
The Court noted that of the twenty-nine
drug kingpin convictions obtained as of
that time, eighteen were the result of
guilty pleas. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> "Those pleas may have
established unequivocal status as a drug
kingpin. Relief from such pleas would not
be warranted" under <EMU>Alexander</EMU>. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
While we do not have evidence of the
number of convictions that would be called
into question by a complete retroactive
application of <EMU>Jackson</EMU>, the PCR court took
notice of the common practice of co-defendant
cooperation in multi-defendant cases.
<SPage 32>

<P20><EMU>Roberts</EMU> concerned the retroactivity of
<EMU>Bruton v. United States</EMU>, 391 U.S. 123, 88
S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). As the
Court explained in <EMU>Roberts</EMU>, the <EMU>Bruton</EMU>
Court held that admission at a joint trial of
a co-defendant's extrajudicial confession
implicating the defendant violated the defendant's
Sixth Amendment confrontation
rights. 392 U.S. 293-95, 88 S.Ct. 1921. The
Court noted that it had "retroactively applied
rules of criminal procedure fashioned
to correct serious flaws in the fact-finding
process at trial." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 294, 88 S.Ct. 1921
(quoting <EMU>Stovall v. Denno</EMU>, 388 U.S. 293,
298, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967)).
The Court found the rule abrogated by
<EMU>Bruton</EMU> was "a constitutional error [that]
present[ed] a serious risk that the issue of
guilt or innocence may not have been reliably
determined." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 295, 88 S.Ct. 1921.
We do not view <EMU>Jackson</EMU> as having corrected
a constitutional error of the magnitude
addressed in <EMU>Bruton</EMU>.

<P20>The new rule announced in <EMU>Jackson</EMU> is
more similar to new rules concerning a
defendant's opportunity to challenge the
credibility of the State's evidence previously
found not to be completely retroactive.
<EMU>See Feal</EMU>, 194 N.J. at 307-12, 944 A.2d 599
(applying pipeline retroactivity to new rule
prohibiting prosecutors from drawing the
jury's attention to defendant's presence at
trial and concomitant opportunity to tailor
their testimony); <EMU>J.A.</EMU>, 398 N.J. Super. at
522-25, 942 A.2d 149 (applying pipeline
retroactivity to new rule permitting jury to
consider passage of time between alleged
sexual assault on a child and child's reporting
of said assault); <EMU>State v. R.E.B.</EMU>, 385
N.J. Super. 72, 84-86, 895 A.2d 1224 (App.
Div. 2006) (applying pipeline retroactivity
to new rule allowing defendant to cross-examine
victim of sexual abuse about prior
false accusation).

<P20>We therefore conclude that complete
retroactive application of <EMU>Jackson</EMU> is not
warranted. Because defendant's direct appeal
was completed at the time <EMU>Jackson</EMU>
was issued, the PCR court correctly determined
she was not entitled to relief under
<EMU>Jackson</EMU> and dismissed her complaint. Given
that defendant would only benefit
<SPage 33>
from complete retroactive application of
<EMU>Jackson</EMU>, we need not decide if pipeline
retroactivity applies to the holding in <EMU>Jackson</EMU>.

<P20>Affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt1> The parties' briefs state defendant sought to
cross-examine D'Anna with respect to a potential
maximum sentence of fifty years. Our
decision on direct appeal refers to a potential
maximum sentence of twenty years. In either
case, our analysis of the retroactive effect of
<EMU>Jackson</EMU> is the same.

<fnt2> The PCR court also concluded that even if
<EMU>Jackson</EMU> was retroactively applied to defendant's
convictions she would not be entitled
to relief. The court found the imposition of
limitations on D'Anna's cross-examination
was harmless error "considering the overwhelming
evidence of the defendant's guilt."
The court noted the State called several witnesses
other than D'Anna and introduced documents
establishing beyond a reasonable
doubt that defendant served as the closing
agent for the transactions and falsified the
HUD closing statements.

[MT]
<P20>The Monmouth County Prosecutor's
Office (MCPO) seeks reversal of the Office
of the Attorney General's (OAG) final decision
denying its request for representation
in an action in lieu of prerogative writs
filed by retired Township of Marlboro
(Township) Deputy Police Chief Frederick
Reck (Reck). Reck entered into an agreement
with the Township after the MCPO
conducted an internal affairs (IA) investigation
and issued a report of its findings
as to allegations of Reck's misconduct in
accordance with the Attorney General Law
Enforcement Directive No. 2022-14 (Directive
2022-14) and the OAG's Internal
Affairs Policy & Procedures, November
2022 Version (IAPP). Reck then filed the
<Page 174>
prerogative writs action against the MCPO
seeking only injunctive relief. Since the
OAG exercised its legislatively-authorized
discretion to deny the MCPO's request for
representation, we affirm.

<CN>I.

<P20>The underlying facts in the record are
not in dispute. Reck was employed as the
Deputy Police Chief for the Township. On
September 15, 2022, the Township of Marlboro
Police Department (MPD) notified
the MCPO it received a complaint against
Reck alleging misconduct in office. As
mandated by the IAPP and the Directive,
the MCPO initiated an IA investigation
into the allegations.

<P20>After the IA investigation was concluded,
the MCPO issued a Summary and Conclusions
Report (the Report) identifying
two sustained allegations against Reck.
One of the sustained allegations required
the MPD to post certain details on the
internet pursuant to Directive 2022-14 and
the Attorney General Law Enforcement
Directive 2019-6, referenced in the IAPP.

<P20>That same day, Chief Pezzullo informed
Reck of the MCPO's findings, and offered
him the opportunity to retire, instead of
proceeding through a disciplinary hearing.
Ultimately, the Township and Reck negotiated
a written agreement memorializing
Reck's retirement on April 1, 2023, providing
in part that
<SPage 38>

<B22>Reck retains the right to challenge the
findings made by [the MCPO] relating
to the aforementioned investigation [and
in] the event that Reck successfully challenges
the findings made by [the
MCPO], and upon notice to the [Township]
of same, the [Township] shall so
amend its records relating to Reck to
reflect the same.

<P20>On June 30, 2023, Reck's counsel wrote
a letter to the MCPO requesting a "copy
of the formal procedures by which he may
challenge the findings of [the Report] and
a copy of [the MCPO's] complete investigation
Report." The MCPO responded that
Reck was precluded from challenging its
findings through the administrative process
post-retirement pursuant to Section
I.E. of Directive 2019-6.

<P20>Reck then filed an action in lieu of prerogative
writs in the Superior Court, Law
Division, Monmouth County, against the
MCPO requesting de novo review of the
findings in the Report. Reck alleged the
MCPO improperly "sustained two allegations
charged against [Reck], at least one
of which will require [the Township] to
post [online] certain details [of the Report],
[and] identify [Reck] by name ... as
part of its compliance obligations [under
the Directive and the IAPP]."

<P20>Reck also alleged the MCPO never identified
the particular administrative process
by which he could challenge the findings in
the Report and demanded the following
remedies in count one:

<B22>(A) dismissal of the [Report's] "sustained
findings" [against him];

<B22>(B) expungement of [Reck's] personal
and/or disciplinary records accordingly;

<B22>(C) removal of [Reck's] name, and any
references to the [IA] complaint brought
against him ... [to] the subsequent investigation
..., and [to] the [Report]
... from the [MCPO's] records;

<B22>(D) removal of [Reck's] name, and any
references to the complaint brought
against him ... from any and all <EMU>Brady/Giglio</EMU><fnr1>
reports ...; and
<Page 175>

<B22>(E) such other legal or equitable relief
deemed appropriate by the [c]ourt.

<P20>In count two, Reck demanded an order

<B22>(A) affirming [Reck's] right to a procedure
by which he may challenge the
findings of [the MCPO's] investigation,
as set forth in its [Report];
<SPage 39>

<B22>(B) directing the [MCPO] to establish
or identify the procedure by which
[Reck] may challenge the findings of the
[MCPO's] investigation, as set forth in
its [Report];

<B22>(C) directing the [MCPO] to provide
[Reck] with a copy of the formal procedures
detailing the particulars and standards
for the procedure; and

<B22>(D) such other legal or equitable relief
deemed appropriate by the [c]ourt.

<P20>On October 2, 2023, the MCPO forwarded
a copy of Reck's complaint to the OAG
with a letter requesting representation in
accordance with <EMU>Wright v. State</EMU>, 169 N.J.
422, 778 A.2d 443 (2001). The MCPO asserted
"the employees involved in this investigation
were acting in their official capacity
and in their regular course of
duties."

<P20>On October 16, 2023, the OAG denied
the MCPO's request positing the State's
duty under <EMU>Wright</EMU> to defend county prosecutor's
office employees only obligates the
OAG "to provide defense and indemnification
to employees when they are being
sued in civil actions seeking damages for
conduct that is tortious and/or violative of
42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983." Because Reck's complaint,
self-titled as an action in lieu of
prerogative writs, sought only non-statutory
equitable remedies and did not assert
any claims for monetary damages, the
OAG determined it is not required to provide
a defense.

<P20>The MCPO's appeal followed.

<CN>II.

<P20>We afford "a `strong presumption
of reasonableness' to an administrative
agency's exercise of its statutorily delegated
responsibilities." <EMU>Lavezzi v. State</EMU>,
219 N.J. 163, 171, 97 A.3d 681 (2014) (citing
<EMU>City of Newark v. Nat. Res. Council,
Dep't of Env't. Prot.</EMU>, 82 N.J. 530, 539, 414
A.2d 1304, <EMU>cert. denied</EMU>, 449 U.S. 983, 101
S.Ct. 400, 66 L.Ed.2d 245 (1980)). However,
we review "an agency's interpretation
of a statute or its determination of a strictly
legal issue" de novo. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 172, 97 A.3d
681 (citing <EMU>Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Intermodal
Props., LLC</EMU>, 215 N.J. 142, 165, 71 A.3d
830 (2013)).
<SPage 40>

<P20>The OAG's determination
should only be reversed if "it is arbitrary,
capricious or unreasonable or [if] it is not
supported by substantial credible evidence
in the record as a whole." <EMU>Prado v. State</EMU>,
186 N.J. 413, 427, 895 A.2d 1154 (2006),
(citing <EMU>In re Taylor</EMU>, 158 N.J. 644, 657, 731
A.2d 35 (1999) (internal quotations omitted)).
We determine if an agency's decision,
such as the OAG's denial of the
MCPO's request for representation, is arbitrary,
capricious, or unreasonable by
considering the following factors:

<B22>(1) [W]hether the agency's action violates
express or implied legislative policies,
that is, did the agency follow the
law; (2) whether the record contains
substantial evidence to support the findings
on which the agency based its action;
and (3) whether in applying the
legislative policies to the facts, the agency
clearly erred in reaching a conclusion
that could not reasonably have been
made on a showing of the relevant factors.

<B22>[<EMU>Lavezzi</EMU>, 219 N.J. at 171, 97 A.3d 681.]

<P00>The burden of proof rests on the party
challenging the agency's administrative action.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
<Page 176>

<CN>III.

<P20>After a thorough review of our jurisprudence
and the record in this case, we
affirm the OAG's discretionary denial of
the MCPO's request for representation in
Reck's action in lieu of prerogative writs
since he sought no tort damages.

<P20>The OAG's duty to defend arises
solely from the Tort Claims Act (TCA),
N.J.S.A. 59:1-1 to -12-3. <EMU>Chasin v. Montclair
State Univ.</EMU>, 159 N.J. 418, 425, 732
A.2d 457 (1999). Neither party has identified
any other governing statute, common
law or contractual obligation to defend.
Thus, we proceed to analyze the applicable
TCA provisions.

<P20>N.J.S.A. 59:10A-1 specifically addresses
the OAG's mandatory duty to defend state
employees, providing:

<B22>Except as provided in section 2 hereof,
the Attorney General shall, upon a request
of an employee or former employee
of the State, provide for the defense
of any action brought against such State
employee or former State employee on
account of an act or omission in the
scope of his employment.

<B22>[N.J.S.A. 59:10A-1.]
<SPage 41>

<P00>N.J.S.A. 59:10A-2 carves out exceptions
to the mandate set forth above by providing
the OAG:

<B22>[M]ay refuse to provide for the defense
of an action referred to in section 1 if
[the OAG] determines that:

<B22>a. the act or omission was not within the
scope of employment; or

<B22>b. the act or the failure to act was
because of actual fraud, willful misconduct
or actual malice; or

<B22>c. the defense of the action or proceeding
by the Attorney General would create
a conflict of interest between the
State and the employee or former employee.

<B22>[N.J.S.A. 59:10A-2.]

<P20>N.J.S.A. 59:10A-3 provides the OAG
with the discretion to defend a current or
former state employee in circumstances
not subject to the mandate of section 10A-1:

<B22>In any other action or proceeding, including
criminal proceedings, the Attorney
General may provide for the defense
of a State employee or former State
employee, if he concludes that such representation
is in the best interest of the
State.

<B22>[N.J.S.A. 59:10A-3.]

<P20>We previously characterized N.J.S.A.
59:10A-3 as "a catch-all," designed to "cover
actions not arising under the [TCA],
including civil actions not seeking damages,
as well as criminal actions[,]" reasoning
the OAG "should have discretionary
authority to furnish a defense for a state
employee when the state interest would be
served." <EMU>Helduser v. Kimmelman</EMU>, 191 N.J.
Super. 493, 508, 467 A.2d 1094 (App. Div.
1983).

<P20>Thus, the OAG is only charged with
defending a state employee to the extent
required under N.J.S.A. 59:10A-1. The legislative
mandate only applies "in the context
of civil actions seeking damages for
tortious conduct." <EMU>Chasin</EMU>, 159 N.J. at 431,
732 A.2d 457; <EMU>see also Gramiccioni v. Dep't
of L. & Pub. Safety</EMU>, 243 N.J. 293, 310, 235
A.3d 129 (2020) ("[T]he TCA governs tort
suits filed against the State and public
entities, and it sets forth defense and indemnification
provisions that distinguish
between State employees and other public
employees."). Defense has only been required
where damages claims have been
asserted, either alone or coupled with requests
for equitable relief. To this end, the
Court has opined:
<SPage 42>

<B22>Given the statutory scheme and the
title of the [TCA], N.J.S.A. 59:10A-1
<Page 177>
mandates that the [OAG] defend "any
action" brought in tort; N.J.S.A. 59:10A-2
specifies three instances when such
representation of tort cases may be refused
by the [OAG]; and N.J.S.A.
59:10A-3 vests the [OAG] with the discretion
to defend in cases not covered by
N.J.S.A. 59:10A-1. Because N.J.S.A.
59:10A-3 grants discretion "in any other
action, including criminal proceedings[,]"
... that discretion cannot be limited to
criminal proceedings, but must include
some civil actions. N.J.S.A. 59:10A-1 requires
the [OAG] to defend state employees
against tort liability, so the civil
claims left to N.J.S.A. 59:10A-3 must
seek a remedy other than tort damages.

<B22>[<EMU>Chasin</EMU>, 159 N.J. at 428, 732 A.2d 457
(emphasis omitted).]

<P00>While not specifically addressing the duty
to provide representation for an action in
lieu of prerogative writs, the Court has
resolved that the OAG's mandatory obligation
"is limited to civil actions seeking
compensatory damages for tortious conduct.
The decision to represent an employee
in any other action is within the discretion
of the [OAG]." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 441, 732 A.2d
457.

<P20>Based on our application of Supreme
Court precedent, we conclude the
OAG's discretionary decision to deny the
MCPO's request for representation was
not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.
<EMU>See Lavezzi</EMU>, 219 N.J. at 171, 97 A.3d 681.
The OAG followed our statutory law&mdash;
which contains no mandate, but instead
affords the OAG discretionary authority
under section 10A-3 to defend state employees
where the claims request no damages.
Thus, the OAG's exercise of legislatively-promulgated
discretion to deny
MCPO's request for representation in
Reck's prerogative writs action was not
arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.

<P20>Our decision is consistent with prevailing
jurisprudence holding the TCA
does not apply to actions in lieu of prerogative
writs. <EMU>See Greenway Dev. Co. Inc. v.
Borough of Paramus</EMU>, 163 N.J. 546, 554-57,
750 A.2d 764 (2000). It is well-settled that
the TCA, and the statutory analogs of our
sister states, do not apply to claims other
than common law causes of action for tort
damages under state law. <EMU>See, e.g.</EMU>, <EMU>Fuchilla
v. Layman</EMU>, 109 N.J. 319, 338-40, 537
A.2d 652 (1988) (Handler, J., concurring)
(maintaining the focus of the TCA is on
negligence and other tortious conduct involving
fault); <EMU>Felder v. Casey</EMU>, 487 U.S.
131, 137-39, 108 S.Ct.
<SPage 43>
2302, 101 L.Ed.2d
123 (1988) (reasoning a state's tort claim
act's notice provision does not apply to
claims brought under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983).
The discretionary nature of the OAG's obligation
to defend the MCPO in an action
in lieu of prerogative writs comports with
our jurisprudence which imposes no independent
obligation to defend, in instances
such as this, where the TCA does not
apply.

<P20>But for the absence of a claim for
tort damages in Reck's complaint, the
OAG might be found responsible for providing
representation to the MCPO. The
Court stated in <EMU>Wright</EMU> that county prosecutors
and their subordinates, such as
county detectives, hold a hybrid status
"with respect to their functions and responsibilities
related to both the county
and the State." <EMU>Wright</EMU>, 169 N.J. at 449-50,
778 A.2d 443 (citing <EMU>Dunne v. Fireman's
Fund Am. Ins. Co.</EMU>, 69 N.J. 244, 248, 353
A.2d 508 (1976)). When prosecutors act in
their law enforcement capacity, "they act
as agents of the State. [However], when
county prosecutors are called upon to perform
<EMU>administrative</EMU> tasks ... such as a
decision whether to promote an investigator,
the county prosecutor in effect <EMU>acts on
behalf of the county</EMU> that is the situs of his
<Page 178>
or her office." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 450, 778 A.2d 443
(citing <EMU>Coleman v. Kaye</EMU>, 87 F.3d 1491,
1499 (3d Cir. 1996) (emphasis added)). The
Court focused on:

<B22>[W]hether the function that the county
prosecutors and their subordinates were
performing during the alleged wrongdoing
is a function that traditionally has
been understood to be a State function
and subject to State supervision in its
execution.

<B22>[<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 454, 778 A.2d 443.]

<P20>County prosecutors act within
the interest of the State when following
the directives of the OAG, which vests
them with vital discretionary decision-making
authority and otherwise supersedes
normal governing rules. <EMU>Gramiccioni</EMU>, 243
N.J. at 317, 235 A.3d 129. When the county
prosecutors act pursuant to state-delegated
responsibility to enforce the law that
the OAG has entrusted to them, it "is not
akin to the administrative duties that have
been exempted from State defense and
indemnification in the past...." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
<SPage 44>

<P20>Although we acknowledge the Court's
analysis, we find it unnecessary to reach
the determination of whether the MCPO
was acting in a law enforcement or administrative
capacity here. The OAG's core
reason for denying the MCPO's request
for representation is predicated on well-established
precedent of the Court, obliging
the OAG to defend as proffered "only
[in] instances in which a public defendant
has been sued for monetary damages [under
the TCA]." Because the underlying
complaint does not seek monetary damages
for tortious conduct by a state employee,
the OAG is not required under the
TCA to defend the MCPO as to Reck's
action in lieu of prerogative writs.

<P20>Affirmed.

<P20>Justice Brobson files a concurring

[CJ]
<P20><dgn>JUSTICE</dgn> <author>BROBSON</author>, concurring.
[CT]
<P20>I agree with the <EM>per curiam</EM> disposition
of this matter. As this Court stated in <EM>New
PA Project Education Fund v. Schmidt</EM>
(Pa., No. 112 MM 2024, filed Oct. 5, 2024)
(PCO), "[t]his Court will neither impose
nor countenance substantial alterations to
existing laws and procedures during the
pendency of an ongoing election."<fnr1>

<P20>Petitioners do raise some important
questions with respect to the authority of
county boards of election to create and
implement their own "notice and cure"
procedures under the Election Code<fnr2> absent
express legislative authority to do so
and, if they do, whether the varied "notice
and cure" practices and policies from county-to-county
violate Article I, Section 5<fnr3>
and/or Article VII, Section 6<fnr4> of the Pennsylvania
Constitution. That said, the 2024
General Election is underway. Petitioners,
however, could have pursued these challenges
in a more-timely fashion. Deciding
these questions at this point would, in my
view, be highly disruptive to county election
administration. Moreover, I can see
the potential need to develop a factual
record in this matter, which could prove
difficult in the compressed timeframe
available to us.

<P20>The decision to deny the application,
however, does not mean that these important
questions should not be decided in
advance of future elections. Petitioners, or
anyone else with standing for that matter,
may present these challenges after the
impending election for consideration by an
appropriate court with appropriate parties
in the ordinary course.

<P20>Justice Mundy joins this concurring
statement.
<FN>
<fnt1> In September 2022, approximately two
months before the General Election, Petitioners
filed a petition for review in the Commonwealth
Court's original jurisdiction against
the acting Secretary of the Commonwealth
and all sixty-seven County Boards. In that
case, as here, they challenged the implementation
of county-level notice and cure procedures
for defective absentee and mail-in ballots.
Ultimately, the Commonwealth Court
dismissed the action, concluding that it
lacked jurisdiction over Petitioners' claims.
<EM>Republican Nat'l Comm. v. Schmidt</EM> (Pa.
Cmwlth., No. 447 M.D. 2022 at 28, filed
March 23, 2023) (unreported decision) (concluding
that "jurisdiction for an action challenging
a [c]ounty [b]oard's development and
implementation of notice and cure procedures
properly lies in the respective [c]ounty's
court of common pleas."). Three election cycles
have since passed, and the Petitioners
have not challenged any of the county notice

[CT]
<P20>I join the <EM>per curiam</EM> disposition of this
matter. In <EM>Republican National Committee
v. Schmidt,</EM> (Pa., No. 108 MM 2024,
filed Oct. 5, 2024) (<EM>RNC</EM>) (PCO), we denied
the application for King's Bench in that
matter expressly invoking the equitable
doctrine of laches. In my respectful view,
that same conclusion is warranted here
with respect to Petitioners' Application for
Exercise of King's Bench or Extraordinary
Jurisdiction ("Application").

<P20>This Court issued its opinion on undated
and incorrectly dated ballot envelopes in
<EM>Ball v. Chapman,</EM> ___ Pa. ___, 289 A.3d 1
(2023), in February 2023, definitively concluding:
"<EM>The Election Code commands</EM>
absentee and mail-in electors to date the
declaration that appears upon ballot return
envelopes, and failure to comply with that
command renders a ballot invalid as a
matter of Pennsylvania law." <EM>Ball,</EM> 289
A.3d at 28 (emphasis added). Petitioners
then, inexplicably, waited over a year&mdash;
during which time the Commonwealth conducted
a municipal primary, municipal
election, and general primary election&mdash;to
challenge the envelope dating requirement,
as interpreted by this Court in <EM>Ball,</EM> as
unconstitutional under the Free and Equal
Elections Clause in Article I, Section 5 of
the Pennsylvania Constitution. They first
did so in a jurisdictionally deficient petition
for review filed in the Commonwealth
Court on May 28, 2024. <EM>See Black Political
Empowerment Project v. Schmidt</EM> (Pa.,
No. 283 M.D. 2024, filed Sept. 19, 2024)
(PCO). When that failed, they filed the
instant application with this Court on September
25, 2024&mdash;one week after the petitioners
filed their King's Bench application
in <EM>RNC.</EM> Under these circumstances, Petitioners
belated requests in their defective
petition in the Commonwealth Court and
their Application created the very exigency
that they now invoke in their Application.
For this reason, I agree that the Application
should be denied.

<P20>In response to the Chief Justice's dissenting
statement, I note that Sections
1306(a) and 1306-D(a) of the Election
Code, 25 P.S. &sect;&sect; 3146.6(a) and 3150.16(a),
as recently interpreted by this Court in
<Page 190>
<EM>Ball,</EM> "are strongly presumed to be constitutional."
<EM>Pa. State Ass'n of Jury Comm'rs
v. Commonwealth,</EM> 619 Pa. 369, 64 A.3d
611, 618 (2013). The fact that someone or
some entity raises a constitutional question
about a statute, in light of this strong
presumption, does not, in my respectful
view, create uncertainty. <EM>See Commonwealth
v. Rollins,</EM> ___ Pa. ___, 292 A.3d
873, 879 (2023) ("[L]egislative exactments
are presumed constitutional, and the party
challenging the constitutionality of a statute
bears a heavy burden of persuasion.").
To the contrary, it is what has become an
all-too-common practice of litigants who
postpone seeking judicial relief on election-related
matters until the election is underway
that creates uncertainty. Moreover,
the ability to develop a record upon which
this matter could be decided would be
difficult on the compressed timeframe engineered
by Petitioners.

<P20>This Court's disposition of the King's
Bench applications in this matter and in
<EM>RNC</EM> should discourage all who look to the
courts of the Commonwealth to change the
rules in the middle of an ongoing election.

<P20>Justice Mundy joins this concurring
statement.

<CN><EMBU>STATEMENT IN SUPPORT
OF DENIAL</EMBU>
[DJ]
<P20><dgn>JUSTICE</dgn> <author>DONOHUE</author>.
[DT]
<P20>There are two cases pending on this
Court's election docket<fnr1> that, depending
on our resolution, may impact the extent of
the disenfranchisement of voters who do
not date, or incorrectly date, the outer
envelopes of their mail-in ballots. This
King's Bench petition presents a challenge
to the constitutionality of a provision of the
Election Code as interpreted by this Court
in <EM>Ball v. Chapman,</EM> ___ Pa. ___, 289
A.3d 1 (2023), that mandates this disenfranchisement.
Petitioners contend that, as
interpreted, that statutory provision violates
Article I, Section 5<fnr2> of our Charter
because it needlessly deprives voters of a
voice in an election when they make this
mistake when filling out the outer envelopes
containing their mail-in ballots.

<P20>Considering whether to declare an act of
the General Assembly unconstitutional is
serious business. It requires an analysis of
the statute as a whole. Decisions in the
pending cases may be critical in any such
analysis. In my view, it is inappropriate to
grant King's Bench jurisdiction in this
matter when the legal landscape may be in
flux. When embarking on considering a
challenge to the constitutionality of a statute,
we must be standing on firm terrain.
We currently are not, and therefore, I
believe it is necessary to deny this King's
Bench petition. Time will tell if there is a
future challenge, in the ordinary course, in
a court of common pleas.

<P20>Justice McCaffery joins this statement
in support of denial.
[DJ]
<P20><dgn>CHIEF JUSTICE</dgn> <author>TODD</author>, dissenting.
[DT]
<P20>I respectfully dissent from the majority's
decision not to exercise our Court's
King's Bench power in this matter. In my
view, it is imperative that we exercise our
King's Bench power and decide this matter
now. The issue before us is of grave importance:
whether invalidation of a voter's
absentee or mail-in ballot &mdash;which is timely
received, but lacks a handwritten date, or
has an incorrect date, on the ballot return
<Page 191>
envelope &mdash; violates the Free and Equal
Elections Clause of our Constitution.<fnr1> Our
county boards of elections, the Secretary
of State, the courts of this Commonwealth
who are tasked with adjudicating election
matters in the first instance, and the voters
themselves need clarity on this issue
prior to Election Day when ballots will be
canvassed. We ought to resolve this important
constitutional question now, before
ballots may be improperly rejected and
voters disenfranchised.<fnr2>

<P20>Our Court's King's Bench authority<fnr3> is
to be used sparingly, but we will invoke it
when necessary to "review an issue of
public importance that requires timely intervention
by [our Court] to avoid the
deleterious effects arising from delays incident
to the ordinary process of law." <EM>Commonwealth
v. Williams,</EM> 634 Pa. 290, 129
A.3d 1199, 1206 (2015). Further, when an
issue broadly and significantly impacts the
public, and fuels widespread concern for
the issue's expeditious resolution, that
weighs heavily in favor of our exercise of
this power. <EM>See, e.g., Friends of Danny
Devito v. Wolf,</EM> 658 Pa. 165, 227 A.3d 872
(2020).

<P20>Here, the issue concerns the fundamental
right to vote, a matter of the utmost
importance to every Pennsylvanian. There
are potentially substantial deleterious consequences
of leaving this issue unresolved
at present, because of the possibility it will
result in the disenfranchisement of voters
who have timely returned their ballots, but
who failed to date, or provided an erroneous
<Page 192>
date, on the return envelope. Moreover,
post-election challenges by voters
whose ballots have been rejected on this
basis have the potential to disrupt the
orderly administration of the electoral process.

<P20>While I recognize time is short, and that
resolving constitutional questions is delicate
and difficult, our Court has considered
such questions in the past and rendered
comprehensive resolutions expeditiously,
and we are eminently capable of doing so
in this instance. Where, as here, the issue
concerns the fundamental right to vote,
and where the consequences of inaction
risk undermining the electoral process, I
deem it imperative to act now.

<fnt1> <EM>Purcell v. Gonzalez,</EM> 549 U.S. 1, 4-5, 127

("Court orders affecting elections, especially
conflicting orders, can themselves result in
voter confusion and consequent incentive to
remain away from the polls. As an election
draws closer, that risk will increase.").

<fnt2> However, we will continue to exercise our
appellate role with respect to lower court
decisions that have already come before this
Court in the ordinary course. <EM>See, e.g., Genser
v. Butler Cty. Bd. of Elections,</EM> 26 & 27 WAP

27 WAP 2024; <EM>Center for Coalfield Justice v.

<fnt2> "Elections shall be free and equal; and no
power, civil or military, shall at any time
interfere to prevent the free exercise of the
right of suffrage." PA. CONST. art. I, &sect; 5.

<fnt1> This provision states: "Elections shall be
free and equal; and no power, civil or military,
shall at any time interfere to prevent the
free exercise of the right of suffrage." Pa.
Const. art. 1, &sect; 5.

<fnt2> In his concurring statement, Justice Brobson
discounts the existence of uncertainty
over the constitutional question presented,
but disregards two facts. First, our Court has
never adjudicated the present constitutional
question. In <EM>Ball v. Chapman,</EM> ___ Pa. ___,
289 A.3d 1 (2023), we held, <EM>as a matter of
statutory interpretation,</EM> that the Election Code
requires a voter to supply a date on the ballot
return envelope. <EM>Id.</EM> at 23 (holding that county
boards of election have authority under the
Code to evaluate whether the date "fall[s]
within the date ranges derived from statutes
indicating when it is possible to send out
mail-in and absentee ballots."). We did not
address the constitutional claim now raised
by Petitioners. Notably, however, three Justices
of an evenly divided Court, in discussing
whether these requirements violated the "materiality"
provision of the Federal Voting
Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. &sect; 10101(a)(2)(B), suggested
that the "failure to comply with the
date requirement would not compel the discarding
of votes in light of the Free and Equal
Elections Clause, and our attendant jurisprudence
that ambiguities are resolved in a way
that will enfranchise, rather than disenfranchise,
the electors of this Commonwealth."
<EM>Id.</EM> at 27 n.156.

<P20>Second, very recently, the Commonwealth
Court found in favor of challengers raising
the identical constitutional question Petitioners
present herein. <EM>See Black Political Empowerment
Project v. Schmidt,</EM> 2024 WL
4002321, *1 (Pa. Cmwlth. filed Aug. 30, 2024)
(unpublished memorandum) ("[T]he dating
provisions serve no compelling government
interest. The refusal to count undated or incorrectly
dated but timely mail ballots submitted
by otherwise eligible voters because of
meaningless and inconsequential paperwork
errors violates the fundamental right to vote
recognized in the free and equal elections
clause."). We vacated that decision on jurisdictional
grounds, without addressing the
merits of the constitutional question. <EM>Black
Political Empowerment Project v. Schmidt,</EM>
2024 WL 4181592 (Pa. filed Sept. 13, 2024)
(order).

<P20>In my view, these cases amply demonstrate
continued uncertainty in this area of the law.

<fnt3> 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 502 (codifying our King's
Bench power "to minister justice to all persons
and to exercise the powers of the court,
as fully and amply, to all intents and purposes,

Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer, at
Westminster, or any of them, could or might
do on May 22, 1722.").

<P20>Respondent challenges the recommendation
of the Disciplinary Board that he
should be suspended for ninety days,
based on the preparation and presentation
of a fee petition for attorneys' fees in a
federal district court. Among his several
claims,<fnr2> Respondent challenges the application
of Pennsylvania Rule of Professional
Conduct 1.5(a)<fnr3> to his conduct. Although
the Office of Disciplinary Counsel ("ODC")
charged Respondent with violations of seven
Rules of Professional Conduct, the Disciplinary
Board only found Respondent in
violation of Rule 1.5(a). While neither the
Hearing Committee nor the Disciplinary
Board found Respondent in violation of
Rule 8.4(d),<fnr4> the Hearing Committee expressed
that further guidance would be
helpful on the rule's application. We ordered
the parties to provide argument on
the application of that Rule under the circumstances
of this appeal. Pursuant to our
review, Rules 1.5(a) and 8.4(d) are inapplicable
under the facts presented. Accordingly,
the Petition for Discipline is dismissed.

<HN00><EMB>I. Background</EMB>

<P20>Respondent was admitted to the practice
of law in Pennsylvania in 2001. He owns,
operates, and manages a personal injury
law firm. On August 26, 2009, Respondent's
client ("Client") sustained injuries in
a motor vehicle accident. The car in which
Client was traveling was insured by an
insurance company ("Insurance Company").
On March 11, 2010, Client retained
Respondent's firm to represent him and
his wife with respect to a claim against
Insurance Company for underinsured motorist
("UIM") benefits. In August 2013,
Respondent's firm filed a civil suit in a
Court of Common Pleas, on behalf of
Client and his wife ("plaintiffs"), against
Insurance Company asserting both a contractual
UIM claim, and a bad faith claim
under Pennsylvania's bad faith statute, 42
Pa.C.S. &sect; 8371. The case was removed to
the United States District Court for the
Middle District of Pennsylvania.
<Page 196>

<P20>Respondent was the supervising attorney
on the case and lead counsel at trial.
Five other attorneys at Respondent's law
firm assisted in the litigation of the lawsuit,
including Respondent's colleague
("Colleague"). Colleague was assigned primary
responsibility for the lawsuit and
entered her appearance on the federal
docket on October 1, 2013.

<P20>Prior to trial, the parties settled the
UIM claim for $25,000, but the bad faith
claim proceeded to a week-long jury trial.
The jury entered a verdict in favor of the
plaintiffs in the amount of $100,000 in
damages. Given the finding of bad faith
in favor of the insureds, the court also
had discretion to award attorneys' fees,
costs, and interest against Insurance
Company. 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8371. Respondent
had never prepared a fee petition, and he
instructed Colleague to seek advice from
another attorney who regularly filed such
petitions. Apparently, that attorney informed
Colleague that the presentation of
a fee petition was straightforward, provided
a sample petition, and indicated
that Respondent's Law Firm should be
able to prepare the petition itself. Notably,
neither Respondent, nor any other
attorney at his firm, had kept any time
records for the federal litigation, such
that, for purposes of the fee petition, the
records had to be created after the fact.
On November 20, 2015, Respondent submitted
a petition for attorneys' fees, interests
and costs, along with a brief in
support on behalf of the plaintiffs, requesting
an award of $946,526.43 for fees
and costs and $175,630 in interest, for a
total of $1,122,156.43. Petition for Attorneys'
Fees, Interests and Costs,
11/20/2015. Insurance Company filed a
brief in opposition, and shortly thereafter,
Respondent filed a reply brief on behalf
of the plaintiffs.

<P20>Given the disparity in the fees requested
compared to the $125,000 obtained for the
plaintiffs, the federal district court judge
directed Respondent to: submit a copy of
the fee agreement entered into with the
plaintiffs; submit a sworn verification from
each attorney involved that the fees requested
were accurate and reflected necessary
services performed on behalf of the
plaintiffs; and to maintain any time records
for any client covering the period of time
relevant to the plaintiffs' case. In response,
Colleague delivered several items to the
court for in camera inspection, including
an undated contingent fee agreement entered
into between the plaintiffs and Respondent's
law firm; the sworn verifications;
and two sets of time logs, one for
each of the plaintiffs' underlying claims.
<EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>Following an evidentiary hearing, the
district court judge denied the request for
attorneys' fees in its entirety because it
was "outrageous and abusively excessive."<fnr5>
The court reached this conclusion after
finding that the petition contained duplicative,
vague, unnecessary, and excessive entries.
The petition also claimed attorneys'
fees for clerical functions, including file
maintenance and document management.
The court noted that Respondent charged
the same hourly rate for all attorneys
without providing any supporting evidence,
such as usual billing rates or descriptions
of experience for each of the attorneys,
which impeded its ability to determine the
reasonableness of the hourly fees. The
court determined that only about 13% of
the claimed attorneys' fees were supported
by the evidence, making the fee petition
anything but a good faith representation of
the attorneys' actual billing rate and the
<Page 197>
hours expended on the case. In addition to
denying the fee petition in its entirety, the
court directed that a copy of its opinion be
served on the Pennsylvania Chief Disciplinary
Counsel. Respondent self-reported
the opinion to ODC on the same day of its
issuance.

<P20>On appeal, the Third Circuit affirmed,
reasoning that district courts have the discretion
to deny a fee petition in its entirety
when the requested amount is "outrageously
excessive" under the circumstances.
Explaining that counsel must
make a good faith effort to avoid claiming
fees for hours that are excessive, redundant,
or otherwise unnecessary, the Third
Circuit concluded that the district court
provided a thorough explanation in its one-hundred-page
opinion of how Respondent
failed to fulfill this duty, which justified the
denial of the fee request.

<P20>On October 1, 2019, ODC filed a Petition
for Discipline charging Respondent with
violating Pennsylvania Rules of Professional
Conduct 1.1, 1.5(a), 5.1(a), 5.1(b),
5.1(c)(1), 5.1(c)(2), and 8.4(d).<fnr6> Petition for
Discipline, 10/1/2019. The Disciplinary
Board appointed a Hearing Committee to
decide the matter, and prior to the hearing,
ODC filed a motion to apply the doctrine
of offensive collateral estoppel based
on the federal court opinions so that it
would be able to satisfy its burden of proof
as to all of the charged violations without
independent evidence. The Hearing Committee
denied the motion and held disciplinary
hearings on August 24, August 25,
and September 9, 2020. On February 1,
2021, the Hearing Committee filed its report,
wherein it recommended no discipline
be imposed because ODC "failed to establish
a prima facie case of at least one
violation" of the rules it charged Respondent
with violating. Hearing Committee's
Report, 2/1/2021, at 3.

<P20>With respect to the fee petition, the
Hearing Committee found that "[w]hile the
testimony at the hearing ... supported
the conclusion that [Respondent] and the
Firm actually spent the time and effort
detailed in the fee petition," it was troubled
by Respondent's business practices.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 12-13. Namely, Respondent and his
law firm "spent an enormous amount of
<Page 198>
time and expense on a relatively small
recovery" without measuring its effort "in
a commercially normal fashion[.]" <EM>Id.</EM>
Nonetheless, the Hearing Committee
found that Respondent did not violate any
of the rules charged, including Rules 1.5(a)
and 8.4(d). <EM>Id.</EM> at 13. Regarding Rule
1.5(a), it found that "the amount requested
reflected actual time spent in preparing
the case, and may even have been on the
conservative side[.]" <EM>Id.</EM> at 16. As to Rule
8.4(d), the Hearing Committee found it to
be a "catch-all Rule" that may apply where
several other violations are found, but as
no other violation was found, the Hearing
Committee found no Rule 8.4(d) violation
occurred. <EM>Id.</EM> at 18. Ultimately, the Hearing
Committee stated that "greater guidance
on the elements" of Rule 8.4(d) would
be helpful. <EM>Id.</EM> Accordingly, the Hearing
Committee recommended that no discipline
be imposed. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>Both ODC and Respondent filed a brief
on exceptions to the Hearing Committee's
decision.<fnr7> On April 16, 2021, the Disciplinary
Board issued an order that stated,
without further explanation, that Respondent
violated Rule 1.5(a) and remanded to
the Hearing Committee for a new hearing
to determine the appropriate discipline.
Disciplinary Board Order, 4/16/2021. The
Hearing Committee conducted another
hearing and issued supplemental reports
that recommended a six-month suspension.
Hearing Committee Supplemental Report,
12/27/2021; Hearing Committee Second
Supplemental Report, 5/31/2022. Respondent
filed his brief on exceptions to the
reports and requested discipline from the
Disciplinary Board that was no greater
than an informal admonition or private
reprimand. Further, he requested oral argument
before the Disciplinary Board.

<P20>A three-member panel of the Disciplinary
Board held oral argument, and it filed
a report on September 6, 2022. Therein,
the Disciplinary Board recommended a
ninety-day suspension. The Disciplinary
Board first explained its reasoning for
finding a violation of Rule 1.5(a). According
to the Disciplinary Board, the Hearing
Committee should not have permitted Respondent
to relitigate the issue of whether
the fee petition was excessive. Instead, the
doctrine of collateral estoppel applied to
the district court's decision and established
the excessiveness of the fee petition. In the
Disciplinary Board's view, application of
the doctrine was even more compelling
under the circumstances presented, "because
the Third Circuit affirmed and supported
the trial court's conclusive findings."
Disciplinary Board's Report and
Recommendations, 9/6/2022, at 21. The
Disciplinary Board cited other disciplinary
rulings where violations of Rule 1.5(a)
were based on excessive fee petitions. <EM>Id.</EM>
at 21-22 (citing <EM>ODC v. Pollick,</EM> No. 5 DB
2018 (finding that an attorney's submission
of a fee petition in federal court, which was
denied as excessive and resulted in sanctions
of $25,000, violated Rule 1.5(a)); <EM>see
also In re Green,</EM> 11 P.3d 1078 (Colo. 2000)
(finding a violation of Colorado RPC 1.5(a)
where some entries in a fee petition submitted
to a court were deemed to be excessive);
<EM>In re Conduct of McGraw,</EM> 362 Or.
667, 414 P.3d 841 (2018) (finding that an
attorney violated RPC 1.5(a) by submitting
petition for fees to court in estate conservatorship
matter that contained "many errors"
and "mischaracterization of work
that should properly be billed as Fiduciary
<Page 199>
Time but was actually billed as Attorney
Time")).

<P20>The Disciplinary Board then reviewed
the other rule violations that had been
charged, concluding that none of them had
been proven by "clear and satisfactory evidence."
Disciplinary Board's Report and
Recommendations, 9/6/2022, at 16-17. Specifically
regarding Rule 8.4(d), the Disciplinary
Board deemed ODC's evidence was
insufficient but offered no further explanation.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 23-24. After considering aggravating
and mitigating factors, the Disciplinary
Board recommended a ninety-day
suspension. <EM>Id.</EM> at 39.

<P20>On October 7, 2022, Respondent filed a
Petition for Review with this Court and
requested oral argument regarding, as relevant
to our disposition, whether Rule
1.5(a) applies under the circumstances presented
by this case. By Per Curiam Order
dated January 27, 2023, we granted Respondent's
petition and, in addition to the
questions for which Respondent sought review,
we ordered the parties to present
argument on the application of Rule 8.4(d)
to the conduct at issue. Order, 1/27/2023.<fnr8>

<HN00><EMB>II. Parties' Arguments</EMB>

<HN00><EMB>Respondent's Arguments</EMB>

<P20>With respect to Rule 1.5(a), Respondent
argues that it does not contemplate a fee
petition situation. In his view, the rule is
designed to protect the client and does not
address situations in which discretionary
attorneys' fees are sought. Respondent's
Brief at 44. He argues that the cases discussing
fee petitions relied upon by ODC
are unpersuasive, because whether Rule
1.5(a) governed fee petitions at all was
neither raised nor decided in any of them.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 45. Consequently, Respondent contends
that these cases cannot be considered
binding or precedential. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>As for Rule 8.4(d), Respondent argues
that "the interference with the administration
of justice usually involves either abuse
of process through meritless litigation, undermining
proceedings through deception,
or incompetence that prejudices a result."
<EM>Id.</EM> at 56. To him, "[f]iling a fee petition in
good-faith, no matter how little the court
liked it, does not rise to the level of a
violation of Rule 8.4." <EM>Id.</EM> at 57. Moreover,
he asserts, that "the filing of the petition
itself was consistent with the law, and the
litigation of the issues raised by the petition
were not so far out of the normal
course of events to violate the Rule." <EM>Id.</EM>

<HN00><EMB>ODC's Arguments</EMB>

<P20>ODC contends that Respondent should
be found in violation of Rule 1.5(a). ODC's
Brief at 36-37. ODC argues that Rule
1.5(a) does apply to fee-shifting petitions,
because the language of the rule provides
that "a lawyer shall not ... charge, or
collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee."
<EM>Id.</EM> at 39. To ODC, the rule applies to
clients and to funds received from third
parties, as well. <EM>Id.</EM> at 40-43. Further, it
highlights previous disciplinary matters
where the Disciplinary Board imposed discipline
for fee petitions that "lacked specificity
[and] were excessive." <EM>Id.</EM> at 41 (citing
<EM>ODC v. Pollick,</EM> No. 5 DB 2018 (D. Bd.
Order, 2/8/2018). ODC criticizes Respondent's
<Page 200>
failure to identify "any cases in
which a court found Rule 1.5 inapplicable
to a fee petition," from Pennsylvania or
any other jurisdiction. <EM>Id.</EM> at 41-42.

<P20>ODC also argues that Respondent violated
Rule 8.4(d). <EM>Id.</EM> at 58. In support of
that position, it explains that Respondent
"submitted and litigated an unsupported,
vague, and poorly reasoned fee petition,
even though the District Court gave him
the opportunity to supplement it." <EM>Id.</EM> To
ODC, this conduct set in motion a series of
events that significantly inconvenienced
the court, wasted limited judicial resources,
and negatively impacted the administration
of justice. <EM>Id.</EM> at 58-59. It believes
that this is "the essence of an 8.4(d)
violation." <EM>Id.</EM> at 60. Moreover, ODC believes
that the rationale employed by the
Third Circuit to deny all fees was based on
precisely the type of attorney misconduct
contemplated by Rule 8.4(d), i.e., "a lawyer's
obligation to the legal system and the
resultant prejudice to the court when the
lawyer fails to meet that obligation." <EM>Id.</EM> In
particular, it highlights the Third Circuit's
statement that if the District Court merely
reduced Respondent's outrageous fee petition,
other "claimants would be encouraged
to make unreasonable demands, knowing
that the only unfavorable consequence of
such conduct would be reduction of their
fee to what they should have asked for in
the first place." <EM>Id.</EM> ODC argues that, in
filing this "deficient, grossly excessive fee
petition with the court," Respondent violated
Rule 8.4(d). ODC's Brief at 62.

<HN00><EMB>III. Analysis</EMB>

<P20>Our standard of review in all disciplinary
matters is de novo; however, the
findings of the Hearing Committee and the
Disciplinary Board are "guidelines for
judging the credibility of witnesses and
should be given substantial deference."
<EM>ODC v. Altman,</EM> 658 Pa. 319, 228 A.3d 508,
516 (2020) (citing <EM>ODC v. Pozonsky,</EM> 644
Pa. 537, 177 A.3d 830, 838 (2018)). As to
whether Respondent violated Rule 1.5(a),
we assume that the relevant facts alleged
by ODC regarding the fee petition filed by
Respondent on behalf of his clients to recover
attorneys' fees from a third party
were established with sufficient evidence.

<HN20><EMB>A. Rule 1.5(a)</EMB>

<P20>When interpreting the Rules of Professional
Conduct, our object is to "ascertain
and effectuate the intention of [] [this]
Court" and "[e]very rule shall be construed,
if possible, to give effect to all its
provisions. When the words of a rule are
clear and free from ambiguity, the letter of
it is not to be disregarded under the pretext
of pursuing its spirit." Pa.R.J.A.
108(a)-(b).

<P20>Chapter One of the Pennsylvania Rules
of Professional Conduct governs the
"client-lawyer relationship." <EM>See</EM> Pa.R.P.C.
Ch. One. Within this chapter, Rule 1.5(a)
provides:

<B24>(a) A lawyer shall not enter into an
agreement for, charge, or collect an
illegal or clearly excessive fee. The
factors to be considered in determining
the propriety of a fee include
the following:

<B46>(1) whether the fee is fixed or contingent;

<B46>(2) the time and labor required, the
novelty and difficulty of the questions
involved, and the skill requisite
to perform the legal service
properly;

<B46>(3) the likelihood, <EMB>if apparent to the
client,</EMB> that the acceptance of the
particular employment will preclude
other employment by the
lawyer;

<B46>(4) the fee customarily charged in
the locality for similar legal services;
<Page 201>

<B46>(5) the amount involved and the results
obtained;

<B46>(6) the time limitations imposed <EMB>by
the client</EMB> or by the circumstances;

<B46>(7) the nature and length of the professional
relationship <EMB>with the
client;</EMB> and

<B46>(8) the experience, reputation, and
ability of the lawyer or lawyers
performing the services.

<P00>Pa.R.P.C. 1.5(a)(1)-(8) (emphasis added).

<P20>We begin with the first sentence
of Rule 1.5(a): "[a] lawyer shall not enter
into an agreement for, charge, or collect an
illegal or clearly excessive fee." Pa.R.P.C.
1.5(a). When interpreting statutory language,
we do so "not in isolation, but with
reference to the context in which it appears[,]"
and we extend the same rationale
to interpreting our own rules. <EM>Commonwealth
v. Kingston,</EM> 636 Pa. 438, 143 A.3d
917, 922 (2016); <EM>see also In re Lackawanna
Cnty.,</EM> 654 Pa. 1, 212 A.3d 1, 6-7 (2019)
("[T]o the extent we must engage in statutory
interpretation of our own procedural
rules, we apply conventional interpretative
principles."). The context for Rule 1.5 is
established by its placement in Chapter
One of the Rules of Professional Conduct,
which governs the "client-lawyer relationship."
The first sentence of the Rule sets
the general prohibition against excessive
fees. The remainder of Rule 1.5(a) lists
eight factors "to be considered in determining
the propriety of a fee ... [,]" three
of which specifically refer to "the client."
Pa.R.C.P. 1.5(a)(3), (6), (7). We must consider
all of the factors enumerated in Rule
1.5(a). The plain language of Rule 1.5(a)
makes clear that its aim is to protect
clients from being charged clearly excessive
fees.

<P20>Further, subsections (b), (c), and
(e) of Rule 1.5 also refer to "the client."
<EM>See</EM> Pa.R.P.C. 1.5(b) ("When the lawyer
has not regularly represented the client,
the basis or rate of the fee shall be communicated
to the client[.]"); Pa.R.P.C.
1.5(c) ("Upon conclusion of a contingent
fee matter, the lawyer shall provide the
client with a written statement stating the
outcome of the matter and, if there is a
recovery, showing the remittance to the
client and the method of its determination[.]");
Pa.R.P.C. 1.5(e) ("A lawyer shall
not divide a fee for legal services with
another lawyer who is not in the same firm
unless: (1) the client is advised of and does
not object to the participation of all the
lawyers involved; and, (2) the total fee of
the lawyers is not illegal or clearly excessive
for all legal services they rendered to
the client."). Additionally, several of the
comments to Rule 1.5 refer to a lawyer's
conduct towards their client. <EM>See</EM> Pa.R.P.C.
1.5, cmts. 1, 3-5. When read in its entirety
&mdash;and in the larger context of Chapter
One governing the lawyer-client relationship
&mdash;it becomes apparent that Rule 1.5(a)
governs fee agreements between the attorney
and the client, charges made to a
client by the attorney and collection of fees
by an attorney from a client.

<P20>The fee petition at the center of
this appeal is not encompassed by Rule
1.5(a) because the petition did not seek to
charge or collect a fee from his client.
Pursuant to Pennsylvania's bad faith statute,
"if the court finds that the insurer has
acted in bad faith toward the insured, the
court may ... [a]ssess court costs and
attorney fees against the insurer." 42 Pa.
C.S. &sect; 8371. Section 8371 is a fee-shifting
statute which permits an insured to recover
attorneys' fees from the insurer. <EM>Id.</EM> The
purpose of awarding attorneys' fees in a
bad faith claim is to put the insured back
in the position she was in prior to paying
an attorney to pursue the underlying
claim. <EM>Klinger v. State Farm Mut. Auto.</EM>
<Page 202>
<EM>Ins. Co.,</EM> 115 F.3d 230, 236 (3d Cir. 1997).
Respondent's clients, the insureds, not Respondent,
sought to recover attorneys' fees
from Insurance Company. The petition
prepared by Respondent was intended to
advance his clients' claim against the insurer.
It did not represent an attempt to
charge or collect fees from the client.

<P20>Moreover, we are not persuaded by
ODC's reliance on <EM>ODC v. Pollick,</EM> No. 5
DB 2018 (D. Bd. Order 2/8/2018), in support
of its argument that Rule 1.5(a) applies
to fee petitions. In <EM>Pollick,</EM> the Disciplinary
Board issued a public reprimand
explaining that Pollick violated Rule 1.5(a)
by submitting a grossly excessive fee petition
in a federal case advancing equal protection
claims. The Disciplinary Board did
not perform any analysis of Rule 1.5(a) to
support the conclusion that it was applicable
in the fee petition context and this
determination was not appealed to this
Court. More importantly, and obviously,
the Disciplinary Board's report does not
bind this Court.<fnr9> <EM>ODC v. Cappuccio,</EM> 616
Pa. 439, 48 A.3d 1231, 1236 (2012).

<P20>Lastly, even though we hold that Rule
1.5(a) does not apply when an attorney
files a fee petition seeking to recover from
an adverse party on behalf of a client, this
does not&mdash;contrary to ODC's suggestion&mdash;
provide an invitation for parties to exploit
their opponent. ODC's Brief at 40. When
presented with a fee petition in a bad faith
claim, trial courts are required to determine
whether the fee being sought is reasonable.
<EM>Birth Ctr. v. St. Paul Companies,
Inc.,</EM> 727 A.2d 1144, 1160 (Pa. Super. 1999),
<EM>aff'd,</EM> 567 Pa. 386, 787 A.2d 376 (2001)
(quoting Pa.R.C.P. 1717). "The [trial]
court's ultimate responsibility is the award
of a `reasonable' fee." <EM>Id.</EM> Further, the
decision to award attorneys' fees upon a
finding of bad faith is wholly within the
discretion of the trial court. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>The underlying bad faith case illustrates
this process, as the federal district court
denied Respondent's fee petition in its entirety
pursuant to the factors outlined in
our Rules of Civil Procedure.<fnr10> The requirement
that trial courts examine the
reasonableness of attorneys' fees as well as
their authority to reduce or refuse to
award attorneys' fees, are the backstops
against excessive fee petitions, not Rule
1.5(a).

<P20>Rule 1.5(a) serves an important
role in ensuring that attorneys do not enter
into an agreement for, charge or collect
an illegal or clearly excessive fee from
their clients. Based on the language of the
rule and its placement within the Rules of
Professional Conduct, we hold that Rule
1.5(a) does not apply where an attorney
files a fee petition seeking to recover fees
on behalf of his client from an adverse
party.
<Page 203>

<HN20><EMB>B. Rule 8.4(d)</EMB>

<P20>The Hearing Committee opined that
Rule 8.4(d) "appears to be a catch-all Rule
that may properly be applied where numerous
other violations are found.... If
an attorney is found to have violated several
Rules of Professional Conduct, it can
be persuasively argued that the attorney
also prejudiced the administration of justice."
Hearing Committee's Report,
2/1/2021, at 18. Because it found that ODC
had not established any other rule violations
at that time, it surmised that there
was no violation of Rule 8.4(d). <EM>Id.</EM> However,
the Hearing Committee expressed its
belief that clarification of the elements of a
violation would be beneficial. The Disciplinary
Board likewise found no violation,
for the reason that ODC's evidence was
insufficient to establish a violation of Rule
8.4(d). It did not explain in what respect
the evidence was insufficient.

<P20>ODC did not challenge the dismissal of
the Rule 8.4(d) charges until this Court
requested argument on this particular issue.
We requested argument on whether
Respondent's conduct violated the Rule.<fnr11>

<P20>Based on our interpretation of Rule
8.4(d) in the context of the entirety of Rule
8.4 and our review of our case law interpreting
it, as well as the arguments of the
parties, we conclude that under the facts
presented, there is no violation of Rule
8.4(d).

<P20>Rule 8.4. provides:

<B22>It is professional misconduct for a lawyer
to:

<B22>(a) violate or attempt to violate the
Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly
assist or induce another to do so, or
do so through the acts of another;

<B22>(b) commit a criminal act that reflects
adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness
or fitness as a lawyer in other
respects;[<fnr12>]

<B22>(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty,
fraud, deceit or misrepresentation,
except that a lawyer may advise, direct,
or supervise others, including clients,
law enforcement officers, and investigators,
who participate in lawful investigative
activities;

<B22>(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial
to the administration of justice;

<B22>(e) state or imply an ability to influence
improperly a government agency or official
or to achieve results by means that
violate the Rules of Professional Conduct
or other law;

<B22>(f) knowingly assist a judge or judicial
officer in conduct that is a violation of
applicable rules of judicial conduct or
other law; or

<B22>(g) in the practice of law, knowingly
engage in conduct constituting harassment
or discrimination based upon race,
sex, gender identity or expression, religion,
national origin, ethnicity, disability,
age, sexual orientation, marital status,
or socioeconomic status. This paragraph
does not limit the ability of a lawyer to
accept, decline or withdraw from a representation
in accordance with Rule
1.16. This paragraph does not preclude
advice or advocacy consistent with these
Rules.

<P00>Pa.R.P.C. 8.4.

<P20>Our focus is specifically on Rule 8.4(d).
Pa.R.P.C. 8.4(d) ("It is professional misconduct
for a lawyer to ... engage in
conduct that is prejudicial to the administration
of justice[.]"). Unlike Rule 8.4's other
<Page 204>
subsections that set forth prohibitions
of specific conduct, Rule 8.4(d) is the only
type of professional misconduct within the
Rule where the consequence defines the
violation. While the other provisions of
Rule 8.4 consider specifically enumerated
acts to be professional misconduct, Rule
8.4(d) only considers "conduct" to be professional
misconduct when the action results
in prejudice to the administration of
justice. Thus, the Rule focuses on the effect
of the conduct to determine whether it
is a Rule 8.4(d) violation, rather than
merely the conduct itself. While this might
suggest that language of Rule 8.4(d) can
be read broadly, it is critical to highlight
that the provision does not state that it is
misconduct for a lawyer to engage in <EMB>any</EMB>
conduct that is prejudicial to the administration
of justice. Chapter Eight of the
Rules focuses on "maintaining the integrity
of the profession." <EM>See</EM> Pa.R.P.C. Ch.
Eight. To maintain the integrity of the
profession, the Rules focus on regulating
conduct that questions a lawyer's "honesty,
trustworthiness or fitness" to practice law.
<EM>See</EM> 8.3, cmt. 3 ("The duty to report involves
only misconduct that raises a substantial
question as to that lawyer's honesty,
trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer
in other respects."); <EM>see also</EM> 8.4, cmt. 1
(noting that only criminal conduct that reflects
adversely on fitness to practice law,
such as fraud, can be violative of the
Rules). Thus, the Rules themselves limit
the type of conduct that can lead to a
violation of Rule 8.4(d). This is true for two
reasons.

<P20>The first, and most obvious reason, is
that another reading leads to unreasonable
results. <EM>See</EM> 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1922 (rule of interpretation
that presumes that a result that
is "absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable"
is not intended). There are
types of conduct by a lawyer that can
impact the administration of justice that do
not reflect on the honesty, trustworthiness
or fitness to practice law. For example, a
lawyer negligently causes a motor vehicle
collision with an official vehicle transporting
a convicted felon to court for sentencing
and as a result of the collision, the
defendant escapes. The lawyer's negligent
driving clearly prejudiced the administration
of justice but just as clearly, that
conduct does not call into question the
lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness
to practice law.

<P20>Second, Rule 8.4(d) is nestled within
a broader Rule that describes conduct
that is considered to be professional misconduct.
In this context, the "conduct" referenced
in Rule 8.4(d) is the conduct otherwise
prohibited by Rule 8.4. Thus, in order
to violate Rule 8.4(d), the otherwise proscribed
conduct must also be prejudicial to
the administration of justice.

<P20>In this regard, we note that it
is a violation of Rule 8.4(a) to violate or
attempt to violate the Rules of Professional
Conduct. Thus, Rule 8.4(d) can be triggered
by the violation of any of the Rules
so long as a violation prejudiced the administration
of justice.<fnr13> A violation of Rule
8.4(d) must be charged in conjunction with
another Rule violation and a Rule 8.4(d)
violation cannot be found if a lawyer has
not otherwise engaged in conduct prohibited
by the Rules. This aligns with a review
of our jurisprudence, as we have not uncovered
<Page 205>
a case where an attorney was
disciplined solely based on a Rule 8.4(d)
violation.

<P20>In support of its position that Respondent
violated Rule 8.4(d), ODC argues that
he "submitted and litigated an unsupported,
vague and poorly reasoned fee petition,
even though the district court gave him
the opportunity to supplement it" and that
this conduct set in motion a series of
events that significantly inconvenienced
the district court, wasted limited judicial
resources, and negatively impacted the administration
of justice. ODC's Reply Brief
at 58-59. Respondent's conduct in drafting
and litigating the fee petition resulted in
multiple charges of Rule violations. However,
no violations have been sustained.
Consequently, although flawed, Respondent's
conduct in drafting the fee petition
and litigating it cannot serve as a basis for
a Rule 8.4(d) violation.

<P20>Based on our case law, we also
take issue with ODC's position that significantly
inconveniencing the district court,
wasting limited judicial resources, and
"negatively" impacting the administration
of justice is necessarily prejudicial to the
administration of justice as contemplated
by Rule 8.4(d).<fnr14> Our case law establishes
that the misconduct contemplated by Rule
8.4(d) arises when there is an attempt to
interfere with the administration of justice
through misrepresentation or other dishonest
misuse of the legal system for improper
means,<fnr15> when an attorney actually
undermines proceedings through deception,<fnr16>
or when an attorney's conduct in
violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct
otherwise obstructs the court's functions
in administering justice.<fnr17> The case of
<EM>ODC v. Baldwin,</EM> 657 Pa. 339, 225 A.3d 817
(2020) provides the most apt illustration of
this lattermost category, when the conduct
of an attorney directly prevents justice
from being administered, even when the
conduct was not dishonest or deceitful.

<P20>In <EM>Baldwin,</EM> ODC charged Cynthia
Baldwin, the Vice-President, General
Counsel, and Chief Legal Officer for Penn
State, with violating, inter alia, Rule
8.4(d) in connection with her representation
of Penn State and three of its administrators
during grand jury proceedings
related to child abuse allegations. The
three administrators were charged with
multiple crimes based on their testimony
before the grand jury. It was later determined
that Baldwin revealed confidential
communications between herself and the
three administrators, breached the attorney-client
privilege, and did so by testifying
against her clients. This testimony
was later determined to be inadmissible.
As a result, the Superior Court quashed
various criminal charges against the three
administrators. <EM>Commonwealth v. Curley,</EM>
131 A.3d 994 (Pa. Super. 2016); <EM>Commonwealth
v. Schultz,</EM> 133 A.3d 294 (Pa. Super.
2016); <EM>Commonwealth v. Spanier,</EM>
132 A.3d 481 (Pa. Super. 2016). In Baldwin's
appeal from the findings of the Disciplinary
Board, we concluded that her
multiple violations of the Rules of Professional
<Page 206>
Conduct<fnr18> resulted in a dismissal of
certain charges against the three administrators,
and the inability to prosecute
these charges was directly attributed to
her violations of the Rules of Professional
Conduct. <EM>Baldwin,</EM> 225 A.3d at 856. Accordingly,
we held that her conduct was
prejudicial to the administration of justice
in violation of Rule 8.4(d). <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20><EM>DiAngelus</EM> involved deceptive conduct
that undermined proceedings. DiAngelus
represented a client who was charged with
failure to maintain financial responsibility
for her motor vehicle, 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1786,
and driving an unregistered vehicle, 75
Pa.C.S. &sect; 1301. <EM>DiAngelus,</EM> 907 A.2d at
454. DiAngelus falsely represented to an
assistant district attorney that the arresting
officer agreed to withdraw the more
serious financial responsibility charge in
exchange for his client's guilty plea to the
lesser unregistered vehicle charge. <EM>Id.</EM>
Based on DiAngelus' misrepresentation,
the Commonwealth agreed that it would
withdraw the financial responsibility
charge. <EM>Id.</EM> We explained that DiAngelus'
misrepresentation was prejudicial to the
administration of justice because the Commonwealth
did not contest certain evidence
presented by DiAngelus because the Commonwealth
was willing to drop the more
serious charge as a direct result of DiAngelus'
misrepresentation.<fnr19> <EM>Id.</EM> at 457-58.

<P20>ODC's reliance on <EM>ODC v. Altman,</EM> 658
Pa. 319, 228 A.3d 508 (2020), is misplaced.
In <EM>Altman,</EM> an attorney was disbarred for
violating numerous Rules of Professional
Conduct based on several instances of misconduct.
Altman had sexual relations with
his client, loaned his credit cards to his
client in an attempt to keep her from
informing his wife about the affair, filed a
lawsuit against the client for manufactured
legal fees, sought to prohibit the client
from participating in or cooperating in any
disciplinary proceedings against him and
filed a protective order to prevent his wife
from being deposed in a lawsuit filed
against him by the same client. <EM>Id.</EM> at 510-11.
In concluding that Altman violated
Rule 8.4(d), we stated that Altman filed a
meritless action for legal fees against his
client,<fnr20> submitted false and misleading affidavits,
and filed a meritless motion for a
protective order in an attempt to prevent
his wife from being deposed to obstruct
another party's access to evidence.<fnr21>

<P20>In the context of discussing <EM>Altman</EM>'s
challenges to certain conclusions of the
Disciplinary Board, we referred to the violations
as those "related to misuse of the
court system." <EM>Altman,</EM> 228 A.3d at 518.
While the charges involved meritless filings
before a magistrate district judge and
then, again, in the Court of Common Pleas,
<Page 207>
these filings were not merely meritless in
violation of Rule 3.1 ("Meritorious Claims
and Contentions"). The filings contained
misrepresentations in violation of Rule
8.4(c) prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty,
fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.
Likewise, the failure to comply with a discovery
order based on a baseless protective
order request resulted in a violation of
both Rule 3.1 and 3.4(a), which prohibits
unlawful obstruction of another party's access
to evidence. <EM>Altman,</EM> 228 A.3d at 518-19.
Each of those violations served as the
foundation for a Rule 8.4(d) violation.

<P20>Although we did not expound on
the basis for our conclusions that this conduct,
related to the misuse of the court
system, resulted in violations of Rule
8.4(d), the lesson from <EM>Altman</EM> is that the
administration of justice is prejudiced
when a lawyer engages in deceitful and
dishonest conduct in court filings and proceedings.
In this context, whether the conduct
actually interferes with the court
function, is not determinative. The attempt
to manipulate the outcome of a case or
proceeding through dishonest conduct is
sufficient to call into question the integrity
of the profession. The administration of
justice is dependent on the honesty and
integrity of the lawyers who practice within
the legal system. Because of the essential
role of lawyers, the administration of
justice has little tolerance for manipulation
by lawyers who violate the rule of conduct
that prohibit deceit, fraud, dishonesty and
misrepresentations, generally and by implication,
in court filings and proceedings.

<P20>We express no opinion here on whether
there would have been a finding of a Rule
8.4(d) violation in any one of the three
separate instances of misconduct in <EM>Altman</EM>
without the totality of the misuse of
the legal system presented in the case. For
example, the attempt to obstruct another
party's access to evidence did not involve a
violation of a Rule prohibiting dishonest
conduct but it was part of a course of
dishonest efforts to misuse the legal system.
We draw insight from the comment to
Rule 8.4 which discusses the kind of illegal
conduct that is violative of subsection (b)
involving criminal acts: "... a pattern of
repeated offenses, even those of minor significance
when considered separately, can
indicate indifference to legal obligation."
Pa.R.P.C. 8.4, cmt. 2. The same is true of
repetitive misconduct indicating an indifference
to the legal system.

<P20>Comparing the facts of this matter
with our case law here, unlike <EM>Baldwin,</EM>
the trial court was not prevented from
adjudicating the fee petition and determining
whether the fees should be awarded.
Even more importantly, Respondent was
not charged with any violation of the Rules
prohibiting deceit, fraud or misrepresentation.
There was no indication that he
sought to mislead the federal district court
in the fee petition proceeding. Although
the fee petition may have required the
trial court to "expend considerable time
and judicial resources," <EM>see</EM> ODC's Brief at
59, this does not rise to the level of interference
with or thwarting the administration
of justice. Although tedious, justice
was administered. This differs from <EM>Baldwin</EM>
and <EM>DiAngelus</EM> where the attorneys'
conduct directly thwarted the administration
of justice. The expense of time and
judicial resources in a court proceeding
does not equate with the type of prejudice
that substantively affects the outcome of
the proceedings, as was the case in <EM>Baldwin</EM>
and <EM>DiAngelus.</EM><fnr22>

<P20>We conclude Respondent did
not violate Rule 8.4(d). First, there has
<Page 208>
been no finding of a violation of any Rule
of Professional Conduct, so there was no
basis to conclude that he engaged in conduct
that could prejudice the administration
of justice. While the analysis could
end here, given our request for briefing on
this issue, we conclude that, under the
circumstances, inconvenience to the court
as a result of an unnecessarily time-consuming
review of a defective petition is
not the prejudice to the administration of
justice as contemplated by Rule 8.4(d).
Absent conduct violative of the rules prohibiting
deceit, dishonesty, fraud or misrepresentations,
a lawyer cannot violate
Rule 8.4(d) unless the violation of the
Rules results in the actual prejudice by
thwarting or interfering with the administration
of justice.

<HN00><EMB>IV. Conclusion</EMB>

<P20>We find that neither Rule 1.5(a) nor
8.4(d) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional
Conduct apply under the circumstances
of this appeal. Accordingly, the
decision of the Disciplinary Board is reversed
and the Petition for Discipline is
dismissed.

<P20>Justices Dougherty, Mundy and
Brobson join the opinion.

<P20>Chief Justice Todd and Justices Wecht
and McCaffery did not participate in the
consideration or decision of this matter.
<FN>
<fnt1> The caption and citation of any related actions
have been omitted in order to protect
Respondent's rights to confidentiality pursuant
to Pa.R.D.E. 402.

<fnt2> Given our ultimate conclusion to dismiss
the Petition for Discipline in this matter, we
do not address Respondent's other challenges.

<fnt3> Pennsylvania Rule of Professional Conduct
1.5 provides, in relevant part: "A lawyer shall
not enter into an agreement for, charge, or
collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee."
Pa.R.P.C. 1.5(a).

<fnt4> Pennsylvania Rule of Professional Conduct
8.4 provides, in relevant part: "It is professional
misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage
in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration
of justice[.]" Pa.R.P.C. 8.4(d).

<fnt5> The federal district court concluded that
plaintiffs were entitled to recover interest on
the $25,000 UIM award, thus it awarded interest
in the amount of $4,986.58.

<fnt6> As summarized by the Hearing Committee,
the Rules are as follows:

<B24>A. Pa.R.P.C. 1.1: A lawyer shall provide
competent representation to a client;

<B24>B. Pa.R.P.C. 1.5(a): A lawyer shall not enter
into an agreement for, charge, or
collect an illegal or clearly excessive
fee;

<B24>C. Pa.R.P.C. 5.1(a): A partner in a law
firm, and a lawyer who individually or
together with other lawyers possesses
comparable managerial authority in a
law firm, shall make reasonable efforts
to ensure that the firm has in effect
measures giving reasonable assurance
that all lawyers in the firm conform to
the Rules of Professional Conduct;

<B24>D. Pa.R.P.C. 5.1(b): A lawyer having direct
supervisory authority over another lawyer
shall make reasonable efforts to
ensure that the other lawyer conforms
to the Rules of Professional Conduct;

<B24>E. Pa.R.P.C. 5.1(c)(1): A lawyer shall be
responsible for another lawyer's violation
of the Rules of Professional Conduct
if ... the lawyer orders or, with
knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies
the conduct involved;

<B24>F. Pa.R.P.C. 5.1(c)(2): A lawyer shall be
responsible for another lawyer's violation
of the Rules of Professional Conduct
if ... the lawyer is a partner or
has comparable managerial authority
in the law firm in which the other lawyer
practices, or has direct supervisory
authority over the other lawyer, and
knows of the conduct at a time when its
consequences can be avoided or mitigated
but fails to take reasonable remedial
action; and

<B24>G. Pa.R.P.C. 8.4(d): It is professional misconduct
for a lawyer to ... engage in
conduct that is prejudicial to the administration
of justice.

<P00>Hearing Committee's Report, 2/1/2021, at 2-3.

<fnt7> Respondent's brief on exceptions was based
solely on his objection to the Hearing Committee's
findings on uncharged conduct which
was included in its Report. Respondent's
Brief on Exceptions to Specific Statements in
the Report of the Hearing Committee,
2/23/2021.

<fnt8> Specifically, that per curiam order provided:

<B22><EMB>AND NOW,</EMB> this 27th day of January, 2023,
upon consideration of the Petition for Review,
the Prothonotary is directed to establish
a briefing schedule and list the matter
for oral argument. In addition to the objections
identified in the Petition for Review,
the parties are ordered to provide argument
as to whether Respondent's conduct violated
Rule 8.4(d) of the Pennsylvania Rules of
Professional Conduct. The Application for
Relief to Extend Protective Orders is granted
pending a final order in this matter.

<P00>Order, 1/27/2023.

<fnt9> We are also not persuaded by ODC's reliance
on other state courts' interpretations of
their own Rules of Professional Conduct. <EM>See
In Re Green,</EM> 11 P.3d 1078 (Colo. 2000) (attorney
violated Colorado's Rule 1.5(a) because
some entries in fee petition were found
"vague" and "excessive"); <EM>In re Conduct of
McGraw,</EM> 362 Or. 667, 414 P.3d 841 (Or.
2018) (attorney violated Oregon's Rule 1.5(a)
by submitting an "excessive" fee petition in
an estate conservatorship matter). Neither
<EM>Green</EM> nor <EM>McGraw</EM> focused on whether their
own versions of Rule 1.5(a) applied to a fee
petition seeking to recover from an opposing
party. These matters simply addressed whether
the fee charged was unreasonable, which is
distinct from the threshold determination we
are faced with here.

<fnt10> While the federal district court relied upon
the "lodestar method" to calculate attorneys'
fees in this matter (i.e., a burden-shifting
framework to determine the reasonableness
of the fees), it recognized that Rule 1717's
factors&mdash;though not separately addressed&mdash;
were integrated into its discussion of the lodestar
calculation.

<fnt11> <EM>See</EM> supra note 8.

<fnt12> As the comments to the Rule explains, "a
lawyer should be professionally answerable
only for [criminal] offenses that indicate lack
of those characteristics relevant to law practice."
Pa.R.P.C. 8.4, cmt. 2.

<fnt13> The Hearing Committee's description of
Rule 8.4(d) as a catch-all rule that may apply
where several violations are found, is inaccurate
in two respects. First, it is not a catch-all
rule because it only applies where a violation
of a Rule prejudices the administration of
justice. Second, in appropriate circumstances,
a single violation of a Rule of Professional
Conduct is all that is necessary to trigger the
application of Rule 8.4(d) if the violative conduct
prejudiced the administration of justice.

<fnt14> Given our conclusion that the absence of a
separate Rule violation precludes a finding of
a violation of Rule 8.4(d), we believe that the
confusion surrounding the Rule's application
stems from the lack of explication in our
jurisprudence supporting previous determinations
that Rule 8.4(d) has been violated.

<fnt15> <EM>See, e.g., ODC v. Altman,</EM> 658 Pa. 319, 228
A.3d 508 (2020).

<fnt16> <EM>See, e.g., ODC v. DiAngelus,</EM> 589 Pa. 1, 907
A.2d 452 (2006); <EM>ODC v. Wrona,</EM> 589 Pa. 337,
908 A.2d 1281, 1281 (2006); <EM>ODC v. Price,</EM> 557
Pa. 166, 732 A.2d 599, 606 (1999).

<fnt17> <EM>See, e.g., ODC v. Baldwin,</EM> 657 Pa. 339, 225
A.3d 817 (2020).

<fnt18> We concluded that she had violated Rules
1.1, 1.6, and 1.7 of the Pennsylvania Rules of
Professional Conduct. <EM>See</EM> Pa.R.P.C. 1.1
("Competence"); 1.6 ("Confidentiality of Information");
1.7 ("Conflict of Interest: Current
Clients").

<fnt19> In addition to finding that DiAngelus violated
Rule 8.4(d), we also determined that he
violated Rules 4.1(a) and 8.4(c). <EM>See</EM> Pa.R.P.C.
4.1(a) (prohibiting a lawyer from knowingly
"mak[ing] a false statement of material fact or
law to a third person"); 8.4(c) (prohibiting a
lawyer from "engag[ing] in conduct involving
dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation").

<fnt20> According to the ODC's brief in that matter,
Altman had filed an action for legal fees
where he "reluctantly admitted" to double
billing his client, and that he had never reviewed
his own billing records until being
cross-examined during the disciplinary hearing.
ODC's Altman Brief at *13-*14.

<fnt21> Although Altman was attempting to claim
marital privilege in a civil lawsuit, his wife
was identified as a party to the loan at issue
in that lawsuit. <EM>Altman,</EM> 228 A.3d at 512.

<fnt22> ODC relies on <EM>ODC v. DiClaudio,</EM> No. 71
DB 2015 for the proposition that "[c]onduct
is prejudicial to the administration of justice
when it unnecessarily expends the limited
time and resources of the court system."
ODC's at 61 (citing <EM>DiClaudio,</EM> No. 71 DB
2015). We are not bound by the findings and
recommendations contained in the Disciplinary
Board's Reports. <EM>Cappuccio,</EM> 48 A.3d at
1236. Similarly, our issuance of per curiam
orders based on these reports does not constitute
an endorsement of any legal conclusion
or reasoning contained therein. <EM>Cagey v. Commonwealth,</EM>
645 Pa. 268, 179 A.3d 458, 467
(2018) (explaining that per curiam orders are
not precedential). Moreover, the decision in
<EM>DiClaudio</EM> was the result of a joint petition for
discipline on consent, pursuant to Pa.R.D.E.
215(d). <EM>ODC v. DiClaudio,</EM> No. 71 DB 2015.
Thus, there was no challenge to Rule 8.4(d)'s
application to the misconduct alleged.

<P20>OPINION BY <author>KUNSELMAN</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<CN><EMB>I. Introduction</EMB>

<P20>In this international-commerce case, the
Plaintiff, Chongqing Kangning Bioengineering
Co., Ltd. ("CKB"), and its Shareholders,
Zou Xiaopng and Zhou Bangli,
appeal from the order dismissing CKB's
complaint against Conrex Pharmaceutical
Corp. Following a bench trial, the Court of
Common Pleas of Chester County ruled
that it lost subject-matter jurisdiction after
CKB deregistered under Chinese law.<fnr1> Because
<Page 212>
deregistration (or dissolution) of a
business entity has no bearing on subject-matter
jurisdiction, we reverse and remand
for further proceedings.

<CN><EMB>II. Factual & Procedural Background</EMB>

<P20>In 2019, CKB sued Conrex Pharmaceutical
Corp., a Pennsylvania corporation, in
Chester County. CKB brought counts for
breach of contract, unjust enrichment, conversion,
and account stated.

<P20>Conrex filed various counterclaims, and
CKB preliminarily objected. The trial
court ruled in favor of Conrex, and CKB
appealed. Reversing, this Court dismissed
Conrex's counterclaims, because they were
subject to arbitration. <EMBI>See Chongqing
Kangning Bioengineering Co., Ltd. v.
Conrex Pharm. Corp.,</EMBI> 253 A.3d 293 (Pa.
Super. 2021) (non-precedential decision).

<P20>On November 5, 2021, the trial court,
<EM>sua sponte,</EM> stayed this case to allow Conrex
an opportunity to arbitrate its counterclaims.
Conrex elected not do so. Three
months later, on February 1, 2022, CKB
deregistered under Chinese law. Then, in
March of 2023, CKB moved to end the
stay. The trial court lifted the stay and
scheduled a bench trial for July 18, 2023.

<P20>According to CKB's counsel, he first
learned of his client's deregistration a few
days prior to trial. He informed Conrex's
attorney and the trial court before the trial
began. At the close of evidence, the court
made no decision. Instead, it issued a rule
to show cause directing CKB to demonstrate
why Conrex "was not entitled to the
relief requested." T.C.O., 7/21/23, at 1. The
trial court explained its show-cause order
in the following footnote:

<B22>An examination of the Complaint and
Answer reveals that [Conrex] has denied
the averments set forth in paragraphs 3
and 4 of the Complaint[<fnr2>] and constitutes
a challenge to [the trial court's] jurisdiction.
<EMBI>See Drake Manufacturing Co. v.
Polyflow, Inc.,</EMBI> 109 A.3d 250 (Pa. Super.
2015). The parties will specifically address
the jurisdiction of the trial court to
proceed in this matter. Specifically,
whether [CKB] is registered to do business
in Pennsylvania pursuant to 15 Pa.
C.S.A. &sect; 411 (in light of the numerous
transactions between the parties in
Pennsylvania, [CKB] acquiring [Conrex's]
trademark, and [CKB] seeking
[Conrex's] assistance in establishing operations
in the United States and Canada.)
<EMBI>See</EMBI> 15 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 401, <EM>et seq.</EM>; 403;
411; 417 (status of foreign dissolution).

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 1, n.2.

<P20>CKB filed a response and included a
footnote to amend the complaint to substitute
CKB's Shareholders as the plaintiffs.
"As identified herein, to the extent necessary,
[CKB] moves to amend its Complaint
to identify Zou Xiaopng and Zhou Bangli
as its successors/the Plaintiffs in this proceeding."
Response to Trial Court's Rule
to Show Cause at 1, n.1.

<P20>In addition, CKB indicated that Conrex
never raised the issue of CKB's supposed
lack of capacity to sue under <EMBI>Drake Manufacturing,
supra,</EMBI> and therefore waived
the issue raised in the show-cause order.
<Page 213>
Furthermore, CKB differentiated the
question of subject-matter jurisdiction
from the question of capacity to sue. It
demonstrated that its causes of actions fell
within the trial court's subject-matter jurisdiction,
because they belonged to the
class of cases that the trial court was
competent to adjudicate. Lastly, CKB provided
a "Foreign Law Opinion" from Yang
Song, a Chinese attorney. Mr. Yang explained
that, in his view, a deregistered
Chinese company may continue actions to
collect debts owed to it, via its former
shareholders, acting as the real parties in
interest.

<P20>Conrex answered that it contested subject-matter
jurisdiction from the start of
the lawsuit, because "this matter belongs
in international arbitration in accordance
with the parties' Collaboration Agreement
...." Conrex's Reply to CKB's Response
to Trial Court's Order to Show Cause at 1.
Conrex also claimed that CKB was no
longer authorized to do business in its own
country, let alone anywhere else. Because
15 Pa.C.S.A &sect; 411 requires foreign corporations
to be registered with the Secretary
of State of Pennsylvania to sue in this
Commonwealth, Conrex agreed with the
trial court's suggestion that CKB could not
pursue this action after it deregistered in
China.

<P20>Regarding the motion to substitute Mr.
Zou and Mr. Zhou as named-plaintiffs for
CKB, Conrex argued that the Shareholders
were strangers to the action who did
not appear or verify any pleadings. It also
claimed there was no evidence at trial
proving CKB's ownership structure.
Hence, in Conrex's view, Mr. Zou and Mr.
Zhou could not show that they had standing
to substitute for CKB.

<P20>The trial court heard oral argument on
September 18, 2023. Three days later, the
court entered an order entitled "DECISION,"
which it said was issued "pursuant
to [its] Rule issued July 21, 2023," and
dismissed CKB's lawsuit "for failure to
join an indispensable party." T.C.O.,
9/22/23, at 1. The show-cause order never
mentioned the issue of nonjoinder of indispensable
parties, nor did the trial court
explicitly say who those supposedly indispensable
parties were. Seemingly, the
court meant the Shareholders whom CKB
moved to substitute in response to the rule
to show cause. The trial court found that
the Shareholders presented insufficient evidence
to substitute themselves for CKB.

<P20>CKB, Mr. Zou, and Mr. Zhou (collectively
"Appellants") jointly appealed from the
order.

<P20>The trial court filed a scathing Pennsylvania
Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(a)
Opinion. It accused Appellants' counsel of
"intentional failure ... to disclose to the
trial court that his [business-entity] client
had been dissolved and was no longer in
existence at the time of the non-jury trial
on July 18, 2023." Trial Court Opinion,
12/18/23, at 1. "Any legal argument alleging
error by the trial court ... is without
legal moment after considering this fraud
perpetuated upon the trial court and the
pursuit of a claim on behalf of a non-existent
client." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 1-2. The trial court
then urged this Court to quash this appeal
based on Appellants' failure to file post-trial
motions. The court observed that it
had labeled its order dismissing the action
as a non-jury decision. It therefore believed
that Rule of Civil Procedure 227.1
compelled Appellants to file post-trial motions
to perfect their appeal.

<P20>Additionally, upon docketing the appeal,
this Court issued Appellants a show-cause
order of its own. We asked why all their
issues should not be dismissed as waived,
given the lack of post-trial motions. Appellants
filed a reply to our show-cause order
and argued that the trial court dismissed
based on its asserted lack of subject-matter
<Page 214>
jurisdiction, an issue immune to the
penalty of waiver. This Court then discharged
the show-cause order and deferred
the question of waiver to this panel.

<CN><EMB>III. Analysis</EMB>

<HN02><EM>A. Appellate Jurisdiction & Absence of
Post-Trial Motions</EM>

<P20>Before addressing the issues raised in
Appellants' brief, we pause to consider (1)
the trial court's request for quashal and (2)
the issue of waiver in the show-cause order
of this Court.

<P20>"Quashal [of an appeal] is usually
appropriate where the order below was
unappealable, the appeal was untimely, or
the Court otherwise lacked jurisdiction
...." <EMBI>Bronson v. Kerestes,</EMBI> 40 A.3d 1253,
1255 (Pa. Super. 2012) (citation omitted)
(quoting <EMBI>Sahutsky v. H.H. Knoebel Sons,</EMBI>
566 Pa. 593, 782 A.2d 996, 1001 (2001)). By
contrast, a party's "[f]ailure to conform
with the requirements of rules of court is
grounds for dismissal" of the appeal. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
As such, the trial court's request that we
quash due to the Appellants' failure to file
post-trial motions is a challenge to the
appellate jurisdiction of this Court.

<P20>While neither party objected to
our jurisdiction, we will briefly respond to
the trial court's jurisdictional concerns.
"This Court may raise the issue of appellate
jurisdiction <EM>sua sponte.</EM>" <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Cross,</EMBI> 317 A.3d 655, 657 (Pa.
Super. 2024) (some punctuation omitted).
"Jurisdiction is purely a question of law;
the appellate standard of review is <EM>de
novo,</EM> and the scope of review plenary." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Typically, appellate jurisdiction extends
to "final orders of the courts of common
pleas." 42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 742. A final order
"disposes of all claims and of all parties."
Pa.R.A.P. 341(b)(1).

<P20>Here, the appealed-from order dismissed
CKB's complaint based on a supposed
lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.
It thereby disposed of all claims and all
parties on procedural grounds. As such,
the order met the definition of a final
order to which our appellate jurisdiction
extends. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 742.

<P20>Therefore, the trial court's suggestion
of quashal was made in error. A party's
failure to file post-trial motions does
not deprive the appellate court of its jurisdiction
to hear the appeal. Instead, as explained
in this Court's show-cause order,
the absence of post-trial motions raises the
possibility of waiver of an appellant's issues.
Hence, our appellate jurisdiction is
properly vested, and we respectfully decline
the trial court's request that we
quash this appeal.

<P20>We now turn to the issue of whether
Appellants' failure to file the post-trial
motions results in waiver of their appellate
issues, as raised in this Court's rule to
show cause. "This Court may, <EM>sua sponte,</EM>
determine whether issues have been properly
preserved for appeal." <EMBI>G & G Investors,
LLC v. Phillips Simmons Real Est.
Holdings, LLC,</EMBI> 183 A.3d 472, 476 (Pa.
Super. 2018).

<P20>"The issue of waiver presents a
question of law, and, as such, our standard
of review is <EM>de novo,</EM> and our scope of
review is plenary." <EMBI>Trigg v. Children's
Hosp. of Pittsburgh of UPMC,</EMBI> 658 Pa.
502, 229 A.3d 260, 269 (2020).

<P20>Following a jury verdict or non-jury
decision, "failure to file post-verdict
motions constitutes waiver of all issues on
appeal...." <EMBI>G & G Investors,</EMBI> 183 A.3d at
476. Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure
227.1 governs the filing of post-trial motions.
To determine whether post-trial motions
are necessary, "we consider whether,
under the circumstances of the action: (i)
<Page 215>
the plain language of Rule 227.1 makes
clear a post-trial motion is necessary; (ii)
case law provides a post-trial motion is
necessary, even if Rule 227.1 is silent on
the subject; and (iii) practicing attorneys
would reasonably expect a post-trial motion
to be necessary." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 477.

<P20>Under the plain language of the Rule, a
party has "ten days after ... the filing of
the decision in the case of a trial without a
jury" to request post-trial relief from the
trial court. Pa.R.C.P. 227.1(c)(2). Thus, in
order for Rule 227.1 and its waiver penalty
to apply, the trial court must first deliver a
non-jury decision at the close of a trial. In
most instances when a party has not filed
post-trial motions, the question becomes
whether the proceeding before the trial
court constituted a trial.

<P20>Here, there is no doubt that the parties
and trial court commenced a trial. However,
what is less clear is whether that trial
resulted in the "filing of a decision." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
The trial court headed the order dismissing
the case for lack of subject-matter
jurisdiction as a "DECISION." T.C.O.,
9/22/23, at 1. This heading alone, however,
does not necessarily mean that the order
was a non-jury decision on the merits of
whether CKB carried its burden of proof
at trial.

<P20>Undeniably, "verdicts are rendered
by a jury, whereas decisions are
made by a trial judge" if the case is tried
to the bench. <EMBI>Sands v. Andino,</EMBI> 404 Pa.Super.
238, 590 A.2d 761, 764 (1991). Thus,
following a bench trial, a non-jury decision
is the procedural equivalent of a jury verdict.

<P20>Notably, here, the "DECISION" that
the trial court entered did not decide any
of the legal or factual issues raised at trial.
The court never decided whether CKB
carried its burden of proof on any of the
counts in the complaint. Instead, the order
resolved the separate and unrelated procedural
question of whether the trial court
lost subject-matter jurisdiction following
CKB's deregistration under Chinese law.
Clearly, questions of subject-matter jurisdiction
are beyond the purview of any jury
to render a verdict upon, because, as stated
above, "[j]urisdiction is purely a question
of law...." <EMBI>Cross,</EMBI> 317 A.3d at 657.

<P20>"Jurisdiction relates solely to
the competency of the particular court or
administrative body to determine controversies
of the general class to which the
case then presented for its consideration
belongs." <EMBI>Glover v. Junior,</EMBI> 306 A.3d 899,
906 (Pa. Super. 2023), <EM>appeal granted,</EM> 314
A.3d 815 (Pa. 2024) (quoting <EMBI>Domus, Inc.
v. Signature Bldg. Sys. of PA, LLC,</EMBI> 666
Pa. 345, 252 A.3d 628, 636 (2021)). Subject-matter
jurisdiction is "defined as the power
of the court to hear cases of the class to
which the case before the court belongs,
that is, to enter into inquiry, whether or
not the court may ultimately grant the
relief requested." <EMBI>Glover,</EMBI> 306 A.3d at 906
(2023).

<P20>By ruling that it lost subject-matter
jurisdiction when CKB deregistered,
the trial court held that CKB's deregistration
divested the court of the power to
hear contract cases and to enter into the
inquiry on the merits. As such, the trial
court never reached the merits of the trial,
much less entered a non-jury decision resolving
the issues of fact and law which the
parties tried. Thus, the trial court never
reached a decision. Instead, the trial court
dismissed the case on jurisdictional
grounds, a purely legal dismissal, outside
the province of the finder of fact.

<P20>Thus, the heading on the order of "DECISION"
was a misnomer, because the
trial court ruled that it was legally <EMBI>incompetent</EMBI>
to issue such a decision. Accordingly,
the obligation to file post-trial motions
does not apply to the appealed-from order,
<Page 216>
because, under the plain language of the
Rule, a party must only file post-trial motions
following the entry of a "decision in
the case of a trial without a jury." Pa.
R.C.P. 227.1(c)(2).

<P20>Instead, the court issued a jurisdictional
order that disposed of all claims and all
parties on procedural grounds &mdash; a final
order that was immediately appealable.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 341(b), <EMBI>supra.</EMBI> Therefore,
the Appellants' issues are immune from
waiver under Pa.R.C.P. 227.1.

<P20>Their appellate issues are as follows:

<B24>1. Did the trial court err as a matter of
law when it dismissed [CKB's] complaint
for failure to join an indispensable
party, when Pa. R.C.P.
1032 states that "the court shall order
... that the indispensable party
be joined" where, as here, Appellant[s]
expressly asked that the complaint
be amended to substitute the
two Shareholders as plaintiffs for
the company.

<B24>2. Whether the trial court erred as a
matter of fact and law (including
Chinese law) when it did not grant
[CKB's] request to substitute its two
Shareholders as plaintiffs.

<B24>3. Whether the trial judge erred when
he failed to recuse himself from the
proceeding after he exemplified bias
based on the national origin of
[CKB] and its representative.

<P00>Appellants' Brief at 4. We primarily address
the first issue, because it affords the
Appellants relief.

<HN02><EM>B. Trial Court Subject-Matter Jurisdiction</EM>

<P20>First, Appellants argue that the trial
court erred by dismissing this suit based
upon its perception that CKB failed to join
indispensable parties. As mentioned, the
trial court never expressly identified the
indispensable parties, but presumably, it
meant the Shareholders.

<P20>Appellants contend that the Shareholders
tried to substitute themselves for
CKB. They assert that, under Pa.R.C.P.
1032, the trial court "<EMBI>shall order</EMBI> that the
indispensable party be joined." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 25
(emphasis by Appellants) (ellipses omitted).
Thus, in their view, the Shareholders
must be permitted to substitute themselves
as the plaintiffs in place of CKB.

<P20>Appellants also claim that this Court's
"remand instructions should include a direction
that judgment be entered in [their]
favor on the account stated claim." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
27. However, they cite no law for the
proposition that this Court may order the
trial court to render a non-jury decision in
a party's favor, especially where, as here,
Appellants made no motion for judgment
as a matter of law in the trial court.

<P20>Conrex's reply is sparse. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Conrex's
Brief at 6-7. It seemingly adopts the trial
court's implied determination that the
Shareholders were indispensable parties.
Conrex argues that CKB "presented no
evidence or testimony whatsoever at trial
relating to [its] ownership structure, for an
amendment of the pleadings to conform
to." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 7. "Rather, [CKB] asked the
trial court to add unknown individuals to
the action after the trial, simply accept
their status as the Shareholders based
merely on their identification as such by
someone not affiliated with [CKB], and
find that [Conrex] is liable to those unknown
individuals." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> As such, Conrex
contends that the trial court properly refused
to substitute the Shareholders for
CKB.

<P20>By their reasoning, the trial court and
Conrex would have it both ways. First,
they claim that the Shareholders are indispensable
parties, such that their nonjoinder
deprived the trial court of subject-matter
jurisdiction. But then, they claim
<Page 217>
that the Shareholders are strangers to this
action who lack standing to substitute
themselves as plaintiffs. Both contentions
cannot be true; either the Shareholders
are indispensable, or they lack standing.
The conflicting positions of the trial court
and Conrex are illogical and untenable.

<P20>Even so, it is unnecessary for us to
decide whether the Shareholders are entitled
to substitute themselves as plaintiffs
for CKB, because the company's deregistration
had no impact upon the trial court's
retention of subject-matter jurisdiction.

<P20>"Subject matter jurisdiction is a
question that is not waivable and may be
raised by a court on its own motion." <EMBI>Domus,
Inc.,</EMBI> 252 A.3d at 636. It presents a
pure question of law; thus, "we review [it]
<EM>de novo.</EM> Our scope of review is plenary."
<EMBI>Glover,</EMBI> 306 A.3d at 906.

<P20>This Court has held that the corporate
dissolution (or its deregistration, as the
process is referred to in China) of a litigant
has no ramification upon pending litigation
in this Commonwealth. As we explained:

<B22>At common law, the dissolution of a
corporation was its civil death; dissolution
immediately <EMBI>abated</EMBI> all actions by
and against a corporation and ended its
capacity to sue or be sued. In Pennsylvania,
under the Act of May 21, 1881,
P.L. 30, and its amendments, dissolved
corporations could "bring suits, and
maintain and defend suits already
brought, for the protection and possession
of their property, and the collection
of debts and obligations owing to, or by,
them."

<P00><EMBI>Erdely v. Hinchcliffe & Keener, Inc.,</EMBI> 875
A.2d 1078, 1083 (Pa. Super. 2005) (emphasis
added).

<P20>Thus, under the common law, the dissolution
of a business entity caused an abatement
<EM>ab initio</EM> of any action to which the
business entity was a party. It did not &mdash;
and never has &mdash; stripped the court of
subject-matter jurisdiction. If dissolution
of a business entity had such a result, the
trial court would, forever thereafter, be
incompetent to hear any cases from the
same class as the case to which the dissolved
business was a party. Surely, the
Court of Common Pleas of Chester County
may continue to hear and pass judgment
upon any contract action, even though
CKB ceased its commercial operations
during the pendency of this litigation.

<P20>Indeed, the current version of the
Act of May 21, 1881 specifically allows for
this lawsuit to proceed to judgment and
potential execution. The General Assembly
of Pennsylvania has dictated, "Every business
corporation that is dissolved ... shall,
nevertheless, <EMBI>continue to exist</EMBI> for the
purpose of ... prosecuting and defending
actions or proceedings by or against it
...." 15 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 1978(a) (emphasis
added). As such, CKB continues to exist
under Pennsylvania law for the limited
purpose of prosecuting this case and, thus,
retains its rights and standing as the plaintiff.
Because CKB still exists for the duration
of this litigation, the trial court mistakenly
held that CKB failed to join the
Shareholders as indispensable parties to
replace itself. Moreover, there was no
"fraud perpetuated upon the trial court
[or] pursuit of a claim on behalf of a non-existent
client." Trial Court Opinion,
12/18/23, at 1-2.

<P20>The trial court's determination that the
deregistration of CKB stripped it of subject-matter
jurisdiction effectively resurrected
the common law of abatement <EM>ab
initio.</EM> This was error. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 15 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 1978(a).

<P20>Regarding the Appellants' request
for judgment as a matter of law, such
relief is inappropriate at this juncture. As
explained above, because the trial court
dismissed the case on jurisdictional
grounds, it did not decide the factual questions
<Page 218>
presented during the trial. Thus,
whether CKB was entitled to a decision in
its favor on the facts, much less judgment
as matter of law, is an open question. The
Appellants' request for judgment as a matter
of law is not yet ripe for appellate
review. If, upon remand, the trial court
finds against CKB in its non-jury decision,
the company may seek judgment as a matter
of law in a post-trial motion.

<P20>In sum, CKB is entitled to relief
from the trial court's ruling that CKB's
deregistering under Chinese law divested
the trial court of subject-matter jurisdiction.
CKB's first issue warrants appellate
relief.<fnr3>

<P20>Order reversed. Case remanded with instructions
for the trial court to issue a non-jury
decision resolving the factual and legal
questions that the parties presented at
trial. Jurisdiction relinquished.
<FN>
<fnt1> CKB was a Chinese company. The parties
agree that deregistration under Chinese law is
the equivalent of business dissolution under
Pennsylvania law.

<fnt2> Paragraphs three and four of the complaint
were boilerplate allegations. "3. Jurisdiction
is proper in this court pursuant to 42 Pa. C.S.
&sect;&sect; 931, 5301. 4. Chester County is the proper
venue because the transaction from which
this dispute arises took place in this county,
and [Conrex] regularly conducts business in
this county." Complaint at 2. In response,
Conrex pleaded, "3-4. The averments of the
corresponding paragraphs consist of one or
more conclusions of law and, as such, are
deemed denied." Answer at 2. Conrex did not
file preliminary objections challenging either
jurisdiction or venue.

<fnt3> We dismiss the remaining appellate issues
as moot and waived, respectively. The Appellants'
second issue is whether the trial court
erred by failing to substitute the Shareholders
as plaintiffs for CKB. Because CKB continues
to exist under Pennsylvania law for purposes
of this litigation, the Shareholder-substitution
question is moot.

<P20>In their third issue, the Appellants ask us to
remove the trial judge based on alleged prejudice
against Asians. However, CKB did not
move for the trial judge to recuse himself.
Generally, issues not raised in the trial court
may not be raised for the first time on appeal.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 302(a). Recusal does not implicate
subject-matter jurisdiction. Hence, the
issue may not be raised for the first time on
appeal. That said, nothing prevents CKB from
requesting that the trial judge recuse himself
following remand.

[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <author>DUBOW</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Appellant, Ralph Skundrich, appeals
from the order entered in the Butler
County Court of Common Pleas on January
26, 2024, denying his first petition filed
pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act
("PCRA"), 42 Pa.C.S &sect;&sect; 9541-46, petition.
Appellant challenges the PCRA court's determination
that it lacked jurisdiction to
review the claims in his first PCRA petition
because Appellant filed it prematurely.
After careful review, we conclude that
given the unusual procedural history in
this case, the PCRA court had jurisdiction
to review the claims in Appellant's first
PCRA petition. We, thus, vacate the order
<Page 220>
and remand for further proceedings consistent
with this Opinion.

<P20>The relevant facts and procedural history
are as follows. On June 19, 2014, a jury
convicted Appellant of Rape and numerous
related offenses. On November 6, 2014, the
trial court sentenced Appellant to an aggregate
term of 382 to 764 months of
incarceration. Appellant did not file a post-sentence
motion.

<P20>On December 9, 2014, more than thirty
days after the trial court entered the
judgment of sentence, trial counsel filed a
notice of appeal from the judgment of
sentence as well as a <EM>praecipe</EM> to withdraw
as counsel.<fnr1> On December 23, 2014,
while Appellant's direct appeal was pending
in the Superior Court, but within one
year of the trial court's entering the judgment
of sentence, Appellant <EM>pro se</EM> filed a
PCRA petition raising numerous claims of
trial counsel's ineffectiveness ("First
PCRA Petition"). The trial court took no
immediate action on that petition.

<P20>On June 28, 2016, the Superior Court
quashed Appellant's direct appeal, concluding
that Appellant's counsel failed to
timely appeal the judgment of sentence.<fnr2>
Accordingly, and most relevant to our
analysis, the dismissal of the appeal confirmed
that Appellant's judgment of sentence
had become final on December 8,
2014, 30 days after the trial court entered
the judgment of sentence.<fnr3>

<P20>On September 5, 2023, Appellant filed,
with leave of court, a counselled, amended
First PCRA petition ("Amended First
PCRA Petition"). He argued that since his
counsel had filed an untimely notice of
appeal and his judgment of sentence had
become final on December 8, 2014, the
PCRA petition had not been premature
and the court had jurisdiction to consider
the merits of the claims that he raised in
his still-pending First PCRA Petition and
Amended First PCRA Petition.

<P20>On October 11, 2023, the Commonwealth
filed an answer and motion to dismiss the
Amended First PCRA Petition, asserting
that the PCRA court lacked jurisdiction to
consider its merits. The Commonwealth
argued that because Appellant filed the
First PCRA Petition during the pendency
of his direct appeal, and continued to litigate
his direct appeal, it was premature
and the PCRA court had no jurisdiction
over it at that time.

<P20>On November 2, 2023, the PCRA court
held a hearing solely on the issue of
whether it had jurisdiction over the First
PCRA Petition and Amended First PCRA
Petition. Following the hearing, on January
26, 2024, the PCRA court granted the
Commonwealth's motion to dismiss, and
<Page 221>
dismissed Appellant's First PCRA Petition
and Amended First PCRA Petition for
lack of jurisdiction.

<P20>Appellant appealed the PCRA's court
order denying his First PCRA Petition
and Amended First PCRA Petition. Both
Appellant and the PCRA court complied
with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.<fnr4>

<P20>Appellant raises the following issue on
appeal:

<B22>Did the PCRA court err by dismissing
for lack of jurisdiction [Appellant's] first
[PCRA petition]&mdash;which he filed <EM>pro se</EM>
on December [23], 2014, after the date
his judgment of sentence became final
and within one year of that date, and
which he amended on September 5,
2023, after receiving leave of court to do
so&mdash;on the sole basis that his facially
untimely direct appeal from his judgment
of sentence was pending in the
Superior Court at the time his <EM>pro se</EM>
PCRA petition was filed?

<P00>Appellant's Brief at 2.

<CN><EMB>A.</EMB>

<P20>"[W]e review an order dismissing
or denying a PCRA petition as to whether
the findings of the PCRA court are supported

legal error." <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Howard,</EMBI>
285 A.3d 652, 657 (Pa. Super. 2022) (citation
and internal quotation marks omitted).
It is an appellant's burden to persuade us
that the PCRA court erred, and that relief
is due. <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Wholaver,</EMBI> 644
Pa. 386, 177 A.3d 136, 144-45 (2018). "[W]e

285 A.3d at 657.

<P20>"It is well-settled that, relative to
PCRA petitions, questions of timeliness
are jurisdictional in nature; therefore,
courts must address these questions as
threshold issues." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Smith,</EMBI> ___ Pa. ___, 310 A.3d 94, 102
(2024). A petitioner must file a PCRA petition
"within one year of the date the judgment

&sect; 9545(b)(1). "[A] judgment becomes final
at the conclusion of direct review, including

42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9545(b)(3). The time for seeking
direct review expires after 30 days if a
defendant does not file a direct appeal
within 30 days of his judgment of sentence
or a post-sentence motion within 10 days
of imposition of sentence. <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Green,</EMBI> 862 A.2d 613, 615 (Pa. Super.
2004) (<EM>en banc</EM>); Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(A)(1)-(3).

<CN>*

<P20>Appellant asserts that, pursuant to
our Supreme Court's recent decision in
<EMBI>Smith, supra,</EMBI> the PCRA court erred in
dismissing the First PCRA Petition by
finding that it lacked jurisdiction to review
the claims raised because Appellant prematurely
filed the First PCRA Petition.
Appellant's Brief at 13-40. We agree.

<P20>Generally, a petitioner may only
file a PCRA petition after he "has waived
or exhausted his direct appeal rights."
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Leslie,</EMBI> 757 A.2d 984,
985 (Pa. Super. 2000). Our Supreme Court
recently explained, however, that "a pending,
facially untimely direct appeal does
not <EM>per se</EM> render a PCRA petition []
premature." <EMBI>Smith,</EMBI> 310 A.3d at 102.

<P20>In <EMBI>Smith,</EMBI> our Supreme Court held that
a PCRA court may hold in abeyance a
petition filed during the pendency of a
<Page 222>
facially untimely direct appeal rather than
dismiss it as a nullity because the PCRA
court's jurisdiction in such instances is unclear
until the viability of the direct appeal
is determined. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 103-04. The Court
concluded in <EMBI>Smith</EMBI> that the PCRA court
and the Superior Court erred in dismissing
the PCRA petition filed during the pendency
of the defendant's facially untimely
direct appeal because neither court had
"engage[d] in a meaningful timeliness analysis"
of the defendant's PCRA petition. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
at 102. The <EMBI>Smith</EMBI> Court directed that the
PCRA court "delay a definitive ruling on
the timeliness of the petition until it has all
the facts necessary to make such an assessment[.]"
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 103. In addressing the
limits of a trial court's authority to act
during the pendency of an appeal, the
<EMBI>Smith</EMBI> Court indicated that, "if a defendant
files a PCRA petition during the pendency
of a facially untimely direct appeal
that may impact the timeliness of his
PCRA petition, then the PCRA court is
empowered to maintain the <EM>status quo</EM> by
entering an order postponing a ruling on
the timeliness of the petition." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 104.

<P20>The Commonwealth attempts to distinguish
<EMBI>Smith</EMBI> by arguing that the Supreme
Court did not create a <EM>per se</EM> rule that the
PCRA court has jurisdiction over a PCRA
petition filed during the pendency of a
facially untimely direct appeal. Commonwealth's
Brief at 11-12, 15. Rather, it argues
that <EMBI>Smith</EMBI> merely requires that the
PCRA court defer ruling on its jurisdiction
until it "has all the necessary facts." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
12. Because the PCRA court here deferred
ruling on its jurisdiction until after it held
a hearing to gather "all the necessary
facts," the Commonwealth argues that the
PCRA court complied with <EMBI>Smith. Id.</EMBI> at
13-14.

<P20>We reject the Commonwealth's argument.
As in <EMBI>Smith,</EMBI> the PCRA court here
reasoned that it lacked jurisdiction to consider
the First PCRA Petition because
Appellant prematurely filed his PCRA petition,
<EM>i.e.,</EM> he filed it during the pendency
of his direct appeal. PCRA Ct. Op. at 3
(unpaginated). The PCRA court, however,
failed to consider that the notice of appeal
filed by trial counsel was facially untimely.
The PCRA court correctly deferred deciding
whether it had jurisdiction over the
First PCRA Petition until this Court confirmed
that trial counsel had filed an untimely
notice of appeal, but once the Superior
Court made that determination, it was
clear that Appellant's judgment of sentence
had become final 30 days after the
trial court entered it. Appellant's First
PCRA Petition was, therefore, not premature.
Thus, the trial court erred in determining
that it lacked jurisdiction to review
the First PCRA Petition.

<P20>Accordingly, we vacate the PCRA
court's Order dismissing First PCRA Petition
and Amended First PCRA Petition.
We find that the trial court has jurisdiction
to consider the claims that Appellant raises
in the First PCRA Petition and Amended
First PCRA Petition.

<P20>Order vacated. Case remanded. Jurisdiction
relinquished.
<FN>
<fnt*> Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior
Court.

<fnt1> We note that in this order, the trial court
also granted counsel's request to withdraw
"upon the appearance of new counsel." Order,
12/10/14. The trial court appointed appellate
counsel on April 22, 2015.

<fnt2> <EMBI>See Commonwealth v. Skundrich,</EMBI> 2010
WDA 2014, 2016 WL 4710210 (Pa. Super.
filed June 28, 2016).

<fnt3> On July 31, 2017, Appellant <EM>pro se</EM> filed a
second PCRA petition claiming that his trial
counsel had been ineffective by failing to file a
timely notice of appeal. On August 7, 2017,
the PCRA court appointed PCRA counsel who
on February 5, 2020, filed an amended second
PCRA, which requested reinstatement of
his direct appeal rights <EM>nunc pro tunc,</EM> or in
the alternative, a new trial based on trial
counsel's ineffectiveness in failing to obtain
an independent expert to review the Commonwealth's
DNA expert's opinion, failing to
object to Appellant being restrained in handcuffs
and a shock belt during trial, and failing
to obtain alibi witnesses. That same day, Appellant
also filed a motion for funds to obtain
a DNA expert, which the PCRA court granted.
The PCRA court dismissed the second PCRA
petition and the amended second PCRA petition.
Appellant has not appealed this dismissal
and thus, we will not discuss it further.

<fnt4> The PCRA court's opinion referred this
Court to its January 26, 2024 memorandum
opinion for an explanation of its reasons for
dismissing Appellant's petitions.

[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <author>MURRAY</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>K.S. (Mother) appeals from the order
granting the petition filed by the Allegheny
County Office of Children, Youth, and
Families (the Agency or CYF), and involuntarily
terminating Mother's parental
<Page 227>
rights to C.S. (a son born in May 2022)
(Child).<fnr1> Upon careful review, we affirm.

<P20>The orphans' court explained how Mother
came to the attention of CYF:

<B42>At [C]hild's birth, he tested positive
for cocaine, methadone and fentanyl.
Mother identified A.H. as Father; however,
paternity has not been established.
Mother has two other children that were
in CYF['s] care since 2015.... Mother
struggled in the past with housing, drug
and alcohol [abuse], and intimate partner
violence.... At the time of []
Child's birth, CYF visited Mother at the
UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital and determined
Mother and Father were
homeless and lived in an abandoned
building in the Homewood section of the
City of Pittsburgh.

<B42>Mother received assistance [from]
UPMC Magee-Women[]s Hospital to
address her drug usage throughout the
course of the pregnancy for methadone,
crack cocaine, and fentanyl.... The
hospital facilitated Mother's admission
into the Sojourner House[, a substance
abuse facility, for methadone maintenance].
Mother admitted[] us[ing] said
substances during the pregnancy term.

<B42>Father was not assessed at that time
by CYF due to an active arrest warrant.
Mother also had an arrest warrant at
the time of Child's birth and was not
assessed by CYF. Child was adjudicated
dependent on August 24, 2022. Aggravated
circumstances were found in this
case due to Child having no contact with
either parent for six[]months....

<B22>....

<B42>CYF created a family plan to address
the issues that led to Child's removal
and placement. In addition to establishing
and maintaining contact with the
[A]gency, the goals for the family included:
drug and alcohol [treatment]; mental
health; visitation and parenting; as well
as obtaining housing.

<P00>Orphans' Court Opinion, 5/30/24, at 5-8
(footnotes omitted).

<P20>On July 21, 2023, CYF filed a petition to
involuntarily terminate the parental rights
(TPR petition) of Mother pursuant to 23
Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2511(a)(1), (2), (5), (8), and (b).
CYF specifically alleged that Child remained
in placement "due to [M]other's
failure to successfully complete her Family
Plan and court-ordered goals." TPR Petition,
7/21/23, at 4 (unpaginated). On October
4, 2023, Mother, through legal counsel,<fnr2>
requested a contested hearing date,
which the orphans' court scheduled for
April 11, 2024.

<P20>Pertinently, however, on January 4,
2024, CYF filed a motion seeking the appointment
of a guardian <EM>ad litem</EM> (GAL)
for Mother. Therein, CYF averred that
Mother was "currently hospitalized and in
a coma." Motion to Appoint GAL, 1/4/24, at
1 (unpaginated). The orphans' court scheduled
a hearing on CYF's motion for February
14, 2024.

<P20>At the hearing, Counsel objected to the
appointment of a GAL for Mother. N.T.,
2/14/24, at 29. Counsel acknowledged that
Mother was incapacitated, but maintained
the orphans' court had no authority to
appoint a GAL to represent an adult in a
TPR action. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 4, 25. Counsel represented
that Child's maternal grandmother
(Grandmother), "initiated proceedings
in Orphans' Court to obtain guardianship
over [Mother]. Not just [GAL,] but full
guardianship." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 3. Counsel requested
a continuance in order for the Orphans'
<Page 228>
Court Division to adjudicate Grandmother's
guardianship petition. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 6.

<P20>At the conclusion of the hearing, the
orphans' court rejected Counsel's arguments
and indicated it intended to appoint
Mother a GAL over Counsel's objection.
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 31. The orphans' court emphasized
Child's need for permanency, and
explained that waiting for Grandmother's
petition to be resolved would require an
indeterminate delay of the termination
proceedings. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 7, 12, 14.

<P20>The orphans' court held a status conference
on March 20, 2024, where Counsel
renewed his objection to the appointment
of a GAL for Mother. N.T., 3/20/24, at 8.
Counsel explained that he had spoken with
Mother "prior to her inability to communicate,"
was aware that she intended to contest
the Agency's TPR petition, and that
Mother would not benefit from the appointment
of a GAL. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 10. The orphans'
court inquired of Counsel whether
Mother would suffer any harm if it appointed
Mother a GAL. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 12. Counsel
stated that if the GAL's recommendation
did not conflict with Mother's desire to
contest the TPR petition, "it doesn't seem
like there would be any harm if there were
a GAL appointed." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 13. On March 25,
2024, the orphans' court appointed Todd
Zwikl, Esquire, as Mother's GAL. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Order,
3/25/24.

<P20>The TPR hearing proceeded as scheduled
on April 11, 2024. Due to her incapacity,
Mother was not present, but was represented
by Counsel. KidsVoice represented
Child, and indicated there was no conflict
between Child's best and legal interests.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 4/11/24, at 125; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T.,
10/4/23, at 8-9. Prior to the hearing, Mother's
GAL advised the orphans' court that
Mother "had no ability to speak to [him] or
to exchange information or respond to anything
[he] asked of her." N.T., 4/11/24, at 5.
Mother's GAL opined that Mother's
"rights ... are being adequately represented
by" Counsel, and offered no further
opinion. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 10. The orphans' court accepted
GAL's written report into evidence,
and GAL did not remain for the rest of the
proceeding. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 14.

<P20>Following GAL's report to the orphans'
court, the Agency presented the testimony
of Jolene James (Ms. James), Assistant
Director of Nursing at Quality Life Services;
Dawn Johnson (Ms. Johnson), a
CYF caseworker; and Lori Marshall (Ms.
Marshall), A Second Life caseworker.

<P20>Ms. James testified that Mother was
admitted to Quality Life Services, a health
care facility offering short-term rehabilitation
and long-term care services, on February
12, 2024. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 16-17. Ms. James
explained that Mother required 24-hour
care as the result of an anoxic brain injury.
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 17-18. Mother's condition rendered
her unable to communicate or perform
any basic functions to care for herself.
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 18. In response to Counsel's
question concerning whether there had
been any improvement in Mother's ability
to communicate since her admission date,
Ms. James testified:

<B22>[Mother] has a nystagmus of her eyes,
which means they both bounce back and
forth. She turns towards a voice, but she
does not focus on any voices or faces. So
is she able to make any kind of eye
contact, blink for communication? No,
she's not. Has she made any changes or
improvements? No.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 19.

<P20>The orphans' court summarized the evidence
adduced from Ms. Johnson's testimony,
as follows:

<B42>Mother did not ... provide any proof
[of] completion [of] any drug and alcohol
treatment [program].... Mother was
incarcerated for approximately eighteen
<Page 229>
months and did not offer any evidence of
programs completed.

<B42>Mother never complied with the housing
goal throughout the pendency of this
case[,] as she was either homeless, lived
in abandoned buildings, or was incarcerated.

<B42>Mother did not meet the parenting or
visitation goal. Mother has two other
children[, who are] not in her care. Although
[] Child remained hospitalized
after testing positive [for illegal drugs]
at birth, Mother did not visit Child[,] nor
seek visitation after giving birth.

<B42>Child has been in CYF's care since
June 7, 2022. Since that time, Mother
had one virtual visit with Child while
partially incarcerated at the Renewal
Center[, a community corrections organization].
CYF attempted to set up video
visits between Mother and Child
through caseworkers at the Allegheny
County Jail, but the visits never occurred
due to difficulties from Mother
being transported to and from the Westmoreland
County Jail, where she remained
incarcerated until November
2023.

<B42>Child resides with maternal aunt and
uncle[ (foster parents), who are preadoptive
resources]. Th[e orphans' court] appointed
an education and medical decision
maker for [] Child due to [medical]
issues that required tubes to be inserted
into his ears, and neither [Mother nor
Father] was available to sign off on the
procedure.

<B42>Lastly, Mother did not participate in
[court-ordered] mental health treatment.
... Mother did not undergo a mental
health evaluation. Furthermore, Mother
did not attend any mental health treatments
since Child's birth.

<P00>Orphans' Court Opinion, 5/30/24, at 8-10
(footnotes omitted).

<P20>Ms. Marshall testified that her role at A
Second Chance, Incorporated, was to ensure
Child's foster parents were satisfying
Child's needs. N.T. 4/11/24, at 90. Ms. Marshall
opined that Child "has a very good
relationship" with foster parents. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 94;
<EMBI>see also id.</EMBI> at 86 (Ms. Marshall testifying
that removal of Child from foster parents'
home would be detrimental "[b]ecause he
does have a healthy bond [with foster parents],
and that's the only space that [Child]
has ever known"); <EMBI>id.</EMBI> at 98 (Ms. Marshall
testifying that foster parents "go above
and beyond" in their care for Child). Additionally,
Ms. Marshall testified that foster
parents also care for Child's biological
brother and half-sister, and Child's siblings,
too, have a positive and beneficial
relationship with Child. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 78, 98-100.

<P20>At the close of testimony, CYF moved
for the admission of, <EM>inter alia,</EM> an "interactional
evaluation" report, authored by
Dr. Patricia Pepe (Dr. Pepe), a licensed
psychologist, after she assessed the bond
between Child and foster parents. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI>
at 103; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> CYF Exhibit 6. Mother
did not object to the report's admission.
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> Dr. Pepe's report concluded, in
pertinent part, as follows:

<B42>[Child] has been placed with ... [foster
parents] since his release from the
hospital following his birth. According to
[foster mother], ... [Mother] is now in a
coma and not expected to survive. [Foster
parents] are also providing a home
for [Child's] sibling[s]. [Child] is obviously
thriving in [foster parents'] care to
the point that he has exceeded the expectations
of his developmental specialist
and no longer requires services.....
[Child] exhibited multiple bonding behaviors
suggestive of a positive and primary
attachment toward his foster parents.
He was consistently interacting
with both [foster parents], always with a
big and bright smile. Further, [foster
<Page 230>
parents] are obviously very committed
to [C]hild.

<P00>CYF Exhibit 6 at 4.

<P20>At the conclusion of the termination
hearing, the orphans' court took the matter
under advisement. On April 17, 2024,
the orphans' court filed an order terminating
Mother's parental rights to Child.
Mother filed a timely notice of appeal and
contemporaneous Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a)(2)(i)
concise statement. The orphans' court has
also complied with Rule 1925.

<P20>Mother raises the following issues for
our review:

<B22>1. Did the [orphans'] court abuse its
discretion and/or err as a matter of law
in appointing a [GAL] for Mother in the
[TPR] matter?

<B22>2. Did the [orphans'] court abuse[] its
discretion and/or err[] as a matter of
law in considering Mother's current
physical condition when such condition
was not identified or alleged in the petition
to involuntarily terminate parental
rights as a condition that has kept
[C]hild in care?

<B22>3. Did the [orphans'] court abuse its
discretion and/or err as a matter of law
in granting the petition to involuntarily
terminate Mother's parental rights pursuant
to 23 Pa.C.S.[A.] &sect; 2511(a)(1)?

<B22>4. Did the [orphans'] court abuse its
discretion and/or err as a matter of law
in granting the petition to involuntarily
terminate Mother's parental rights pursuant
to 23 Pa.C.S.[A.] &sect; 2511(a)(2)?

<B22>5. Did the [orphans'] court abuse its
discretion and/or err as a matter of law
in granting the petition to involuntarily
terminate Mother's parental rights pursuant
to 23 Pa.C.S.[A.] &sect; 2511(a)(5)?

<B22>6. Did the [orphans'] court abuse its
discretion and/or err as a matter of law
in involuntarily terminating Mother's parental
rights pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.[A.]
&sect; 2511(a)(8)?

<B22>7. Did the [orphans'] court abuse its
discretion and/or err as a matter of law
in concluding that CYF met its burden
of proving by clear and convincing evidence
that termination of Mother's parental
rights would best serve the needs
and welfare of [Child] pursuant to 23
Pa.C.S.[A.] &sect; 2511(b)?

<P00>Mother's Brief at 7-8 (issues reordered).

<P20>We review the termination of parental
rights for an abuse of discretion.
<EMBI>See In the Int. of K.T.,</EMBI> ___ Pa. ___, 296
A.3d 1085, 1104 (2023). This standard of
review requires appellate courts to

<B22>accept the findings of fact and credibility
determinations of the trial court if they
are supported by the record. If the factual
findings are supported, appellate
courts review to determine if the trial
court made an error of law or abused its
discretion. As has been often stated, an
abuse of discretion does not result merely
because the reviewing court might
have reached a different conclusion. Instead,
a decision may be reversed for an
abuse of discretion only upon demonstration
of manifest unreasonableness,
partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will.

<B42>As [the Pennsylvania Supreme Court]
discussed in [<EMBI>In re:</EMBI>] <EMBI>R.J.T.,</EMBI> [608 Pa. 9, 9
A.3d 1179, 1190 (2010)], there are clear
reasons for applying an abuse of discretion
standard of review.... [U]nlike
trial courts, appellate courts are not
equipped to make fact-specific determinations
on a cold record, where trial
judges are observing the parties during
the relevant hearing and often presiding
over numerous other hearings regarding
the child and parents. <EMBI>R.J.T.,</EMBI> 9 A.3d at
1190. Therefore, even where the facts
could support an opposite result, as is
often the case in dependency and termination
cases, an appellate court must
<Page 231>
resist the urge to second guess the trial
court and impose its own credibility determinations
and judgment; instead, we
must defer to the trial judges so long as
the factual findings are supported by the
record and the court's legal conclusions
are not the result of an error of law or
an abuse of discretion.

<P00><EMBI>In re Adoption of S.P.,</EMBI> 616 Pa. 309, 47
A.3d 817, 826-27 (2012) (some citations
omitted).

<P20>In her first issue, Mother faults the
orphans' court for appointing Mother a
GAL, arguing "[t]here is no statute or rule
empowering a[n orphans'] court in a [TPR]
proceeding to appoint a [GAL] for an adult
person." Mother's Brief at 27.

<P20>The Pennsylvania Rules of Orphans'
Court Procedure define a GAL as "a fiduciary
who is appointed by a court in a legal
proceeding to represent an individual or
class of individuals under a legal disability."
Pa.R.O.C.P. 1.3. An orphans' court
derives its authority to appoint GALs in
TPR actions from the Adoption Act. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 23
Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2313(a) (the court may appoint
a GAL to represent a child in a TPR action
when it is in the bests interests of the
child). Prior to its June 30, 2022, rescission
and replacement, Orphans' Court Rule
15.4(c)(1) (pre-rescission Rule 15.4) provided
a limited avenue for the appointment of
a GAL for a parent in a TPR action. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
Pa.R.O.C.P. 15.4(c)(1) (effective to June 30,
2022, "the court shall appoint [a <EMB>minor</EMB>
parent] a [GAL,]" "unless the court finds
the parent is already adequately represented").

<P20>The only other source of authority for an
orphans' court to appoint a GAL is found
in Orphans' Court Rule 5.5(a)(1). The Rule
provides, in relevant part, as follows:

<B22><EMB>(a)</EMB> On petition of the accountant or any
interested party, or upon its own motion,
the court may appoint [a GAL] <EMB>if the
court considers that the interests of
the non-</EMB><EMBI>sui juris</EMBI> <EMB>individuals are not
adequately represented:</EMB>

<B44>(1) <EMB>a</EMB> [<EMB>GAL</EMB>] <EMB>to represent</EMB> a minor or <EMB>a
person believed to be incapacitated</EMB>
under the provisions of Chapter 55 of
Title 20, <EMB>but for whom no guardian
of the estate is known to have been
appointed</EMB> by a Pennsylvania court or
by the court of any other jurisdiction[.]

<P00>Pa.R.O.C.P. 5.5(a)(1) (emphases added).

<P20>"There are two classes of guardian:
(1) guardian of the person, who assumes
primary physical responsibility for
the care and custody of the incapacitated
individual[,] and (2) guardian of the estate,
<EMB>who is entrusted with the control of</EMB> <EMBU>the
property</EMBU> <EMB>of the incapacitated individual."</EMB>
<EMBI>See In re C.A.J.,</EMBI> 319 A.3d 564, 572
(Pa. Super. 2024) (citation omitted; emphasis
added)). We are further cognizant that
Rule 5.5 does not grant a GAL "sweeping
powers" over the financial and medical decisions
of an incapacitated person. <EMBI>See Estate
of J.L.C.,</EMBI> 321 A.3d 999, 2024 PA
Super 151, *8 (Pa. Super. 2024).

<P20>Chapter 55 of Title 20 (Decedents, Estates
and Fiduciaries) sets forth the statutory
law concerning incapacitated persons
and guardianship. Section 5502 explains "it
is the purpose of this chapter to promote
the general welfare of all citizens by establishing
a system which permits incapacitated
persons to participate as fully as possible
in all decisions which affect them," and
to "protect[] their rights...." 20 Pa.
C.S.A. &sect; 5502. An "incapacitated person" is
defined as

<B22>an adult whose ability to receive and
evaluate information effectively and
communicate decisions in any way is
impaired to such a significant extent
that he is partially or totally unable to
manage his financial resources or to
<Page 232>
meet essential requirements for his
physical health and safety.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> &sect; 5501. Sections 5511 and 5513, respectively,
describe the procedures for an individual
to petition to serve as guardian and
emergency guardian of an incapacitated
person. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> &sect;&sect; 5511, 5513. Pertinently,
however, "<EMB>the court may not grant to a
guardian powers</EMB> controlled by other statute,
including, but not limited to, the power
... <EMB>[t]o consent, on behalf of the
incapacitated person, to the relinquishment
of the person's parental rights."</EMB>
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> &sect; 5521(f)(2) (emphasis added).

<P20>In her scant, one-page argument, Mother
cites <EMBI>In re J.L.P.,</EMBI> 215 A.3d 627, 1552
MDA 2018 (Pa. Super. 2019) (unpublished
memorandum),<fnr3> for the proposition that
"an incapacitated parent is not entitled to
a GAL in a TPR matter when that parent
already has legal counsel providing adequate
representation...." Mother's Brief
at 27-28. Mother maintains the "appointment
of a GAL for Mother was an error
that compromised the framework of the
TPR proceeding and constitutes a structural
error ... not subject to [a] harmless
error analysis...." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 28 (citing <EMBI>In re
L.B.M.,</EMBI> 639 Pa. 428, 161 A.3d 172 (2017)).

<P20>In response, CYF relies on <EMBI>In re S.C.B.,</EMBI>
990 A.2d 762 (Pa. Super. 2010) (discussed
<EM>infra</EM>), and pre-rescission Rule 15.4(c)(1).<fnr4>
CYF Brief at 47. CYF concedes that "a
GAL is not required when a parent is
adequately represented by counsel." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
CYF maintains, however, that "the failure
of the [o]rphans' [c]ourt [j]udge in the
<EMBI>S.C.B.</EMBI> case to mandate that the GAL appear
at hearings was found to be harmless
error." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> CYF continues:

<B22>The purpose for the GAL [in the instant
case] was to ensure that [Mother]'s
rights were protected when [Mother]
was not able to communicate with her
attorney. The only other option would
have been for the TPR proceedings to
be put on indefinite hold while the [orphans']
court waited for a decision to be
made in Adult Orphans' Court[,] which
would have in turn violated [Child]'s
rights to permanency. The [o]rphans'
[c]ourt did not err in appointing a GAL
for [Mother,] and then promptly discharging
the GAL after 17 days. In applying
the facts of the <EMBI>S.C.B.</EMBI> case to the
case at hand, appointing a GAL and
then dismissing the GAL once it was
determined there was no need for one
due to [Mother] having competent counsel,
would actually only serve to ensure
[Mother]'s rights were adequately protected.
Therefore, it was not an error[,]
or at most a harmless error.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 47-48.

<P20>Upon review, <EMBI>In re S.C.B.</EMBI> appears to be
the only decisional authority touching on
Mother's first issue, albeit in <EM>dicta</EM> and in
connection with a now-rescinded Orphans'
Court Rule. In <EMBI>In re S.C.B.,</EMBI> CYF petitioned
for the involuntary termination of
an <EMB>adult</EMB> mother's parental rights. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
765. Additionally, CYF filed a motion to
appoint a GAL for mother, "based on her
mental health issues[,]" which the lower
court granted on February 8, 2008. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
Mother retained private counsel on February
29, 2008. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> On November 7, 2008,
<Page 233>
mother's GAL filed a written report with
the trial court. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> The TPR hearing occurred
over six days, between February
and April of 2009. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> GAL for mother did
not attend; mother's counsel did not object
to GAL's absence. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 765-66. The trial
court ultimately granted CYF's TPR petition,
and mother appealed, arguing, in
part, that the trial court improperly allowed
the TPR hearing to proceed in the
absence of mother's GAL. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 766.

<P20>The <EMBI>S.C.B.</EMBI> Court first determined that
mother waived the issue. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 768. Nevertheless,
even had mother not waived the
issue, the <EMBI>S.C.B.</EMBI> Court opined that "the
reasoning behind" pre-rescission Rule
15.4(c)(1) "is equally persuasive when an
allegedly mentally incompetent parent has
adequate representation by her own counsel.
Thus, the appointment of a [GAL] is
not required in such a situation." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
769. The Court concluded:

<B22>[W]e agree with the trial court that the
continued representation of [m]other by
the [GAL] was unnecessary after
[m]other retained her own private counsel[,]
who adequately represented her
interests. Thus, the trial court did not
commit an abuse of its discretion in failing
to require the [GAL] to appear at
the hearings. Any resultant error from
the trial court's failure to enter such an
order or to permit the [GAL] to withdraw
his representation was harmless.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (footnote omitted). Significantly, the
<EMBI>S.C.B.</EMBI> Court did not identify (nor was it
tasked with identifying) the authority by
which the trial court could appoint an adult
mother a GAL in a TPR proceeding, apart
from pre-rescission Rule 15.4(c)(1).

<P20>Instantly, in its Rule 1925 opinion, the
orphans' court acknowledged that,

<B22>[a]lthough Mother may meet the <EM>statutory
definition</EM> of an incapacitated person
as defined under [Section] 5501, the
[orphans' c]ourt also recognizes its jurisdictional
limitations and inability to
make the all[-]encompassing legal determination
of general incapacity in another
designated division of the Allegheny
County Court of Common Pleas.<fnr5> The
[c]ourt has a general obligation to safeguard
the integrity of proceedings and
ensure that all parties' rights are protected.
There is no guidance on how an
arguably incapacitated parent can participate
in their termination hearing.

<P00>Orphans' Court Opinion, 5/30/24, at 30
(emphasis in original; footnote added).

<P20>The orphans' court further explained
why it appointed Mother a GAL, rather
than delay the TPR hearing in order for
Grandmother to litigate her guardianship
petition:

<B42>Mother's counsel.... represented to
the court that [Grandmother] was in the
process of filing for guardianship in the
Orphans' Division[,] and learned that it
would require at least "60 days" for the
"paperwork to be generated[,]" and
there was no guarantee that [guardianship]
would be granted.... [Grandmother's
counsel] proffered to the court
that [Grandmother] filed a guardianship
<Page 234>
petition for Mother, but [Grandmother's
counsel] anticipated it would be three to
four months before a hearing date was
set in the Orphans' Court Division[,] and
that the petition would not be resolved
prior to the TPR hearing date. [Grandmother's
counsel] also informed the
court that although there was a remedy
of an emergency guardian appointment
in Orphans' Court, [Grandmother] had
not sought such an action....

<B42>The [c]ourt reiterated that the Child
has been in CYF care since the week of
his birth[,] and there is no guarantee of
when, or if, [Grandmother]'s guardianship
petition would be granted.
"[C]ourts must keep ... the ticking
clock of childhood ever in mind. Children
are young for a scant number of years
and we have an obligation to see [to]
their healthy development quickly." [<EMBI>In
re T.S.M.,</EMBI> 620 Pa. 602, 71 A.3d 251, 269
(2013)]. Upon inquiry by the court as to
the harm by appointing a GAL to ensure
that Mother had [a] fair proceeding,
<EMB>Mother's [C]ounsel agreed that there
would be no harm if [GAL] did not
contradict [Mother]'s direction of proceeding
in a contested hearing.</EMB> No
party at that point had presented the
court with any evidence of Mother's alleged
incapacity other than statements
made by counsel. Although Mother had
competent counsel, CYF felt another action
was needed. Th[e orphans'] court
acted with foresight rather than hindsight
to ensure the rights of all were
protected and a fair hearing occurred.
... At no time during the brief appointment
of GAL for Mother, was there a
contradiction in Mother's legal direction.
... [<EMB>M</EMB>]<EMB>other was not aggrieved by the
court's action and nothing about it
affected her rights or</EMB> [<EMB>C</EMB>]<EMB>ounsel's representation
of her. Thus, no harm or
prejudice occurred.</EMB>

<P00>Orphans' Court Opinion, 5/30/24, 31-33
(footnotes omitted; emphases added).

<P20>The orphans' court's factual recitation is
supported by the record. However, upon
review of the foregoing authority, we
agree with Mother that the orphans' court
erred by appointing Mother a GAL.

<P20>Rule 5.5(a)(1) permits an orphans'
court to appoint an individual a
GAL where he or she is believed to be
incapacitated and "for whom no <EMB>guardian
of the estate</EMB> is known to have been appointed
...." Pa.R.O.C.P. 5.5(a)(1) (emphasis
added). Because Rule 5.5(a)(1) contemplates
the appointment of a GAL in
matters related to an incapacitated person's
finances and property, it is inapplicable
to TPR actions; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> Pa.R.O.C.P.
15.1 ("The practice and procedure with
respect to adoptions shall be as provided
by Act of Assembly and <EMB>the Rules under
this Chapter XV."</EMB> (emphasis added)).<fnr6>

<P20>Even if Rule 5.5(a)(1) applied in
TPR actions, however, it would not have
empowered the orphans' court to appoint
Mother a GAL under the facts of this case.
Although <EMBI>In re S.C.B.</EMBI>'s analysis was
premised on pre-rescission Rule 15.4(c)(1),
its reasoning would apply with equal force
to Rule 5.5(a)(1)'s proviso that a court may
appoint a GAL to a person "believed to be
incapacitated" <EMB>and</EMB> who is not "adequately
represented." As it is uncontested that
Mother was adequately represented at the
time the orphans' court appointed GAL,
the orphans' court lacked the authority to
<Page 235>
appoint GAL. <EMBI>See In re S.C.B.,</EMBI> 990 A.2d at
769.

<P20>Nevertheless, we agree with the
orphans' court that this error was harmless.
The sole authority Mother relies upon
for her assertion that GAL's appointment
constituted a "structural error" "that compromised
the framework of the TPR proceeding"
is plainly distinguishable. Mother's
Brief at 28; <EMBI>see also In re L.B.M.</EMBI> 161
A.3d at 183 ("[T]he <EMB>failure</EMB> to appoint
<EMB>counsel</EMB> for a <EMB>child</EMB> involved in a contested,
involuntary termination of parental
rights proceeding is a structural error and
is not subject to harmless error analysis"
(emphasis added)). Just as the erroneous
appointment of a GAL to a parent in <EMBI>In re
S.C.B.</EMBI> constituted harmless error, the
same is clearly true in the instant case.

<P20>Here, Counsel conceded that appointing
Mother a GAL would cause her no harm,
provided the GAL did not contradict Mother's
desire to proceed with a contested
TPR hearing. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 3/20/24, at 13
(Counsel stating, "it doesn't seem like
there would be any harm if there were a
GAL appointed"). At the TPR hearing,
GAL offered no opinion, and deferred to
Counsel. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 4/11/24, at 10-11. Accordingly,
the orphans' court's error
caused Mother no prejudice and was
harmless. Mother's first issue merits no
relief.<fnr7>

<P20>In her second issue, Mother
claims the orphans' court erred by "considering
Mother's current physical condition
when such condition was not identified
or alleged" in the Agency's TPR
petition. Mother's Brief at 7. In her
half-page argument, Mother claims "[t]he
record contained no competent evidence
for the [orphans'] court to determine the
specific nature or duration of any alleged
physical incapacity of Mother." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
at 26. Mother continues, "[t]he record is
also clear that Mother's physical condition
was neither a reason why [Child]
was removed and placed in care, nor a
basis pleaded by CYF to establish a
finding of repeated incapacity of Mother."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 27 (citation omitted).

<P20>Preliminarily, we consider whether
Mother has preserved this issue. In its
Rule 1925 opinion, the orphans' court
opines "Mother's failure to object resulted
in waiver of this issue." Orphans' Court
Opinion, 5/30/24, at 26. Mother counters
that she "clearly preserved this issue during
final argument with the [orphans']
court." Mother's Brief at 27 (citing N.T.,
4/11/24, at 116). Because the record confirms
that Mother failed to lodge an objection,
we agree with the orphans' court that
Mother waived her second issue. <EMBI>See Interest
of S.K.L.R.,</EMBI> 667 Pa. 609, 256 A.3d
1108, 1124 (2021) ("[T]o preserve a claim
that evidence was admitted in error, the
offended party must timely object to the
admissibility of the evidence and state a
specific ground for the objection." (citations
omitted)).

<P20>However, even if Mother had preserved
her challenge with a timely objection, it
would afford her no relief.

<P20>We review questions concerning
the admissibility of evidence under the
following standard:

<B22>[T]he decision of whether to admit or
exclude evidence is within the sound discretion
<Page 236>
of the orphans' court. A reviewing
court will not disturb these rulings
absent an abuse of discretion. Discretion
is abused if, <EM>inter alia,</EM> the orphans'
court overrides or misapplies the law.

<P00><EMBI>In re A.J.R.-H.,</EMBI> 647 Pa. 256, 188 A.3d
1157, 1166-67 (2018) (citations omitted).

<P20>"All relevant evidence is admissible,
except as otherwise provided by law."
Pa.R.E. 402. "The well-settled test for relevancy
states that evidence is relevant if
`(a) it has any tendency to make a fact
more or less probable than it would be
without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of
consequence in determining the action.'"
<EMBI>Interest of S.K.L.R.,</EMBI> 256 A.3d at 1124
(quoting Pa.R.E. 401). In a TPR proceeding,
the orphans' court, as fact-finder,
"should assign that evidence the appropriate
weight to which it is entitled in reaching
its factual and legal conclusions." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>The content of a petition to involuntarily
terminate parental rights is governed by
23 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2512 and Orphans' Court
Rule 15.10. Pursuant to Section 2512,
"[t]he petition shall set forth specifically
those grounds and facts alleged as the
basis for terminating parental rights." 23
Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2512(b). Moreover, Rule 15.10
provides, in pertinent part:

<B22>(a) Petition. A petition for involuntary
termination of parental rights under 23
Pa.C.S.[A.] &sect;&sect; 2511-2512 shall contain
the following averments:

<C5>* * *

<B44>(10) a reference to the applicable subsection(s)
of 23 Pa.C.S.[A.] &sect; 2511(a)
providing the ground(s) for termination
and specific facts to support
terminating the parental rights of the
subject birth parent pursuant to the
subsection(s) referenced[.]

<P00>Pa.R.O.C.P. 15.10(a)(10).

<P20>It is undisputed that CYF did not plead
additional facts after Mother suffered a
debilitating brain injury. However, Counsel
was clearly aware of Mother's condition
prior to the April 11, 2024, TPR hearing.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 2/14/24, at 25 (Counsel stating
Mother "meets the definition of incapacitated
persons under [Section] 5510, Title
20."); Motion to Appoint GAL, 1/4/24, at 1
(unpaginated) (CYF averring Mother was
"currently hospitalized and in a coma").
Pursuant to Orphans' Court Rule 1.2(b),
the Orphans' Court Rules

<B22>shall be liberally construed to secure the
just, timely and efficient determination
of every action or proceeding to which
they are applicable. The court at every
stage of any action or proceeding may
disregard any error or defect of procedure
that does not affect the substantive
rights to the parties in interest.

<P00>Pa.R.O.C.P. 1.2(b).

<P20>Upon review, we conclude the orphans'
court did not abuse its discretion by considering
evidence of Mother's physical condition.
Counsel was aware of Mother's condition,
and Mother suffered no harm as a
result of CYF's failure to amend its original
TPR petition. Accordingly, if preserved,
Mother's second issue would merit
no relief.<fnr8>

<P20>Mother next argues the orphans'
court improperly terminated her parental
rights pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 2511(a)(1). Mother's Brief at 18.

<P20>Termination of parental rights
is governed by Section 2511 of the Adoption
<Page 237>
Act, which requires a bifurcated analysis:

<B22>Initially, the focus is on the conduct of
the parent. The party seeking termination
must prove by clear and convincing
evidence that the parent's conduct
satisfies the statutory grounds for termination
delineated in [Section] 2511(a).
Only if the court determines that the
parent's conduct warrants termination of
his or her parental rights does the court
engage in the second part of the analysis
pursuant to [Section] 2511(b): determination
of the needs and welfare of the
child under the standard of best interests
of the child. One major aspect of
the needs and welfare analysis concerns
the nature and status of the emotional
bond between parent and child, with
close attention paid to the effect on the
child of permanently severing any such
bond.

<P00><EMBI>Matter of Adoption of L.C.J.W.,</EMBI> 311 A.3d
41, 48 (Pa. Super. 2024) (citation omitted).
"The standard of `clear and convincing'
evidence is defined as testimony that is so
clear, direct, weighty, and convincing as to
enable the trier of fact to come to a clear
conviction, without hesitance, of the truth
of the precise facts in issue." <EMBI>In re Adoption
of C.L.G.,</EMBI> 956 A.2d 999, 1004 (Pa.
Super. 2008) (<EM>en banc</EM>) (citation omitted).
Finally, this Court need only agree with
the orphans' court as to "any one subsection
of [Section] 2511(a), in addition to
[Section] 2511(b), in order to affirm the
termination of parental rights." <EMBI>Int. of
M.E.,</EMBI> 283 A.3d 820, 830 (Pa. Super. 2022)
(citation omitted).

<P20>Instantly, we examine Mother's challenge
pursuant to Section 2511(a)(1), which
provides:

<B22><EMB>(a) General rule.</EMB>&mdash;The rights of a parent
in regard to a child may be terminated
after a petition filed on any of the
following grounds:

<B44>(1) The parent by conduct continuing
for a period of at least six months
immediately preceding the filing of
the petition either has evidenced a
settled purpose of relinquishing parental
claim to a child or has refused
or failed to perform parental duties.

<P00>23 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2511(a)(1).

<P20>To satisfy Section 2511(a)(1), the petitioner
"must produce clear and convincing
evidence of conduct, sustained for at least
the six months prior to the filing of the
termination petition, which reveals a settled
intent to relinquish parental claim to a
child or a refusal or failure to perform
parental duties." <EMBI>In re Adoption of B.G.S.,</EMBI>
245 A.3d 700, 706-07 (Pa. Super. 2021)
(citation omitted); <EMBI>see also In re Adoption
of Charles E.D.M.,</EMBI> 550 Pa. 595, 708 A.2d
88, 91 (1998) ("Section 2511[(a)(1)] does not
require that the parent demonstrate both a
settled purpose of relinquishing parental
claim to a child <EM>and</EM> refusal or failure to
perform parental duties." (citation omitted;
emphasis in original)).

<P20>In applying Section 2511(a)(1),

<B22>[t]he court should consider the entire
background of the case and not simply
... mechanically apply the six-month
statutory provision. The court must examine
the individual circumstances of
each case and consider all explanations
offered by the parent facing termination
of h[er] parental rights, to determine if
the evidence, in light of the totality of
the circumstances, clearly warrants the
involuntary termination.

<P00><EMBI>In re Adoption of A.C.,</EMBI> 162 A.3d 1123,
1129 (Pa. Super. 2017) (citations and paragraph
break omitted). However, the General
Assembly's emphasis on the six
months immediately preceding the filing of
the petition indicates the timeframe is the
"most critical period for evaluation" of a
<Page 238>
parent's conduct. <EMBI>In re Adoption of L.A.K.,</EMBI>
___ Pa. ___, 265 A.3d 580, 592 (2021).

<P20>Regarding the definition of "parental
duties," our Supreme Court has explained:

<B22>Our courts long have interpreted parental
duties in relation to the needs of a
child, such as love, protection, guidance
and support. Parental duties are carried
out through affirmative actions that develop
and maintain the parent-child relationship.
The roster of such positive
actions undoubtedly includes communication
and association. The performance
of parental duties requires that a parent
exert [herself] to take and maintain a
place of importance in a child's life. Fortitude
is required, as <EMB>a parent must act
with "reasonable firmness" to overcome
obstacles that stand in the way
of preserving a parent-child relationship
and may not wait for a more
suitable time to perform parental responsibilities.</EMB>

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (citations, some quotation marks, and
brackets omitted; emphasis added).

<P20>Mother asserts "[t]he record is clear
that Mother made repeated attempts to
not only address her [parenting] goals
through entering treatment[,] but also by
seeking visitation with [Child]." Mother's
Brief at 21. Mother asserts "it was the
fault of the system[,] and not Mother[,]
that visits had not occurred while Mother
was incarcerated." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Conversely, the orphans' court cogently
summarized its findings with respect to
Section 2511(a)(1) as follows:

<B22>[F]rom the time of Child's birth to the
[] TPR hearing, Mother did nothing
substantial to address her drug use.
[Ms.] Johnson testified credibly about
Mother's unwillingness to address her
substance abuse disorder. [N.T., 4/11/24,
at 44-45.] At the onset of this case,
Mother was provided the opportunity of
a referral [for drug and alcohol treatment],
which Mother never completed.
[<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 36.]

<B42>Mother failed to complete any substance
abuse treatment program that
she claimed to have attended. In fact,
the [orphans' c]ourt heard testimony
that in early September 2022, [Grandmother]
informed CYF that Mother had
been arrested and was being sent to a
rehabilitation facility. Less than one
month later, CYF observed Mother panhandling
in the City of Pittsburgh[,] and
[she] appeared to be under the influence.
[<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 37].

<B42>Mother's substance [ab]use intensified
when she was not incarcerated. In November
2023, Mother was briefly in a
rehabilitation facility in Wilkinsburg,
PA, to receive treatment, and was found
lying unconscious in the street. She has
yet to recover, physically, and is now
living in a skilled nursing facility....

<B22>....

<B42>... Mother could not secure and
maintain housing. CYF presented credible
testimony that Mother was either
homeless or incarcerated during the lifetime
of his case. [<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 46.] Housing is
essential for a child's stability and development.

<B42>... Mother failed to have regular and
consistent visits with Child. The [orphans'
c]ourt was presented with credible
testimony ... that Mother had only
one visit with Child in the twenty-two
months Child has been in care. [<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
47.] Any effort by Mother to arrange
visitation only occurred during Mother's
incarceration or rehabilitation stays.
When Mother was at liberty in the community,
she did not attempt to arrange
or attend any visitations.... Mother
chose not to visit [C]hild when there
were no obstacles, including [while
<Page 239>
C]hild remained in the hospital withdrawing
from being born drug positive.

<B42>... Mother did not participate in her
goal of mental health treatment. Mother
was ordered at the shelter care hearings
to have a mental health assessment, [of]
which she did not avail herself. The record
demonstrates that CYF was never
able to make a referral for the appropriate
level of mental health treatment for
Mother because she was either "incarcerated
or absent." [<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 74.] No evidence
was presented that contradicted
this assertion.

<B42>.... Mother did not remedy the conditions
that brought Child into CYF's
care and custody. No meaningful actions
were taken by Mother to remedy such
conditions. The evidence presented
clearly established the persistent and
continued nature of the issues that have
caused Mother to be unable to provide
essential care for the Child. Given the
fact that the Child has been in [the] care
of CYF for twenty-two months, the [orphans'
c]ourt justifiably concluded that
Mother will not remedy the problems
that have made her incapable of functioning
as the Child's parent.

<P00>Orphans' Court Opinion, 5/30/24, at 15-18
(footnotes omitted).

<P20>Our review confirms the orphans' court's
findings are supported by the record, and
free of legal error. Thus, we discern no
error in the orphans' court's finding that
Mother failed to perform parental duties
for at least six months prior to CYF's
filing of the TPR petition. <EMBI>See S.P.,</EMBI> 47
A.3d at 827 ("an appellate court must ...
defer to the trial judges so long as the
factual findings are supported by the record
and the court's legal conclusions are
not the result of an error of law or an
abuse of discretion."). Mother's challenge
to termination of her parental rights of
Child, under Section 2511(a), is without
merit.<fnr9>

<P20>In her final issue, Mother challenges
termination of her parental rights
under 23 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2511(b). When the
orphans' court finds grounds for termination
under Section 2511(a), it must separately
consider a child's needs and welfare:

<B22><EMB>(b) Other considerations.</EMB>&mdash;The court in
terminating the rights of a parent shall
give primary consideration to the developmental,
physical and emotional needs
and welfare of the child. The rights of a
parent shall not be terminated solely on
the basis of environmental factors such
as inadequate housing, furnishings, income,
clothing and medical care if found
to be beyond the control of the parent.
....

<P00>23 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2511(b).

<P20>"Notably, courts should consider
the matter from the child's perspective,
placing [their] developmental, physical,
and emotional needs and welfare above
concerns for the parent." <EMBI>K.T.,</EMBI> 296 A.3d at
1105. Courts must also "discern the nature
and status of the parent-child bond, with
utmost attention to the effect on the child
of permanently severing that bond." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
(citation omitted). However, "the parental
bond is but one part of the overall subsection
(b) analysis." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 1113.

<B42>The Section 2511(b) inquiry must also
include consideration of other important
factors such as: the child's need for permanency
and length of time in foster
care ...; whether the child is in a preadoptive
home and bonded with foster
parents; and whether the foster home
<Page 240>
meets the child's developmental, physical,
and emotional needs, including intangible
needs of love, comfort, security,
safety, and stability.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (footnote and citations omitted).

<P20>Here, the orphans' court explained its
rationale for concluding termination was in
Child's best interests:

<B42>In making its decision to terminate
Mother's parental rights, the [orphans'
c]ourt heavily relied on Dr. [] Pepe's
expert report and the conclusions contained
therein[,] as well as other witnesses[,]
including ... [Ms.] Johnson
and ... [Ms.] Marshall.....

<B42>The [C]hild was placed with foster
parents when he was released from the
hospital approximately one week after
his birth. [CYF Exhibit 6 at 4.] The
Child's 12-year-old [half-]sister[,] as well
as [C]hild's 11-year-old biological brother[,]
are in [the same] foster home.
[N.T., 4/11/24, at 78.] Child receives love
and affection in the pre-adoptive home.
[<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 84; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> CYF Exhibit 6 at 3.]
[Foster parents] reside in a five-bedroom
home. [Foster father] has three
sons[] who are adults and out of the
home, and [foster mother] has two
[adult] daughters. [CYF Exhibit 6 at 3.]
[Foster parents] are gainfully employed.
[Foster mother] is a banker[,] and [foster
father] is an [information technology]
director. [<EMBI>Id.</EMBI>]

<B42>[Ms.] Johnson and [Ms.] Marshall
credibly testified about their firsthand
observations between Child and foster
parents. [Ms. Johnson and Ms. Marshall]
testified that they had no concerns
about the foster parents, as they meet
all of [Child's] developmental and medical
needs. [N.T., 4/11/24, at 85; <EMBI>id.</EMBI> at 98.]
The [C]hild was current with medical
care[,] and foster parents have assumed
all the responsibilities for medical care
for the [C]hild. [<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 98-99.]

<B22>....

<B42>The court adopted the opinion of Dr.
Pepe that the Child "exhibited multiple
bonding behaviors suggestive of a positive
and primary attachment towards his
foster parents." [CYF Exhibit 6 at 4.]
[Dr. Pepe] further remarked that the
foster family presented as a "very positive
permanent resource for [Child]."
[<EMBI>Id.</EMBI>]

<B42>Child has been out of Mother's care
since the week of his birth, and[,] because
Mother has only had one virtual
visit during the life of the case[,] there
was no evidence presented that a bond
existed with Mother..... Mother continued
to place her own needs and desires
above those of [C]hild. When Mother
was living in the community, she did
not avail herself of visitation nor services
to allow her to serve a parental
role. Mother has never demonstrated
that she could provide [C]hild with safety,
security and stability. Mother's substance
abuse has remained and worsened
to the point of her incapacity. The
evidence presented demonstrated that
Mother is no longer able to care for
herself and requires 24-hour care. Mother
is physically incapable of meeting the
needs and welfare of a small toddler.

<P00>Orphans' Court Opinion, 5/30/24, at 21-24.

<P20>We agree with the reasoning and determination
of the orphans' court, as it is
supported by the record and free of legal
error. <EMBI>S.P.,</EMBI> 47 A.3d 817, 826-27. The orphans'
court acted within its discretion
when it credited Dr. Pepe's report and the
testimony of Ms. Johnson and Ms. Marshall.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI>; <EMBI>see also L.C.J.W.,</EMBI> 311 A.3d at 48
("It is the province of the orphans' court to
assess credibility and resolve any conflicts
in the evidence, and in doing so it is free to
believe all, part, or none of the evidence
presented." (citation and quotation marks
omitted)). Accordingly, Mother is entitled
<Page 241>
no relief, and we affirm the order terminating
Mother's parental rights.

<P20>Order affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt1> The orphans' court also involuntarily terminated
the rights of A.H. (Father). Father is not
a party to the instant appeal.

<fnt2> Jeffrey K. Eisenberg, Esquire (Counsel),
represented Mother in the TPR action.

<fnt3> In her brief, Mother acknowledges that unpublished
memoranda filed <EMB>after May 1,
2019,</EMB> may be cited for their persuasive value.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Mother's Brief at 28 (citing Pa.R.A.P.
126(b)). <EMBI>In re J.L.P.</EMBI> is an unpublished memorandum
decision that this Court filed on
<EMB>March 7, 2019.</EMB>

<fnt4> In its brief, CYF cites to "Pa.O.C. Rule
15.2(c)(1)." CYF Brief at 47. However, Rule
15.2 defines various terms, and does not contain
subsections. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.R.O.C.P. 15.2. As
CYF cites to the Rule in conjunction with <EMBI>In
re S.C.B.,</EMBI> 990 A.2d at 768 (analyzing pre-rescission
15.4(c)(1)), we discern CYF relies
on pre-rescission Rule 15.4(c)(1).

<fnt5> The Honorable David L. Spurgeon presided
over both the dependency proceedings in Allegheny
County's Family Division, and the termination
proceedings in the Orphans' Court
Division. The court explained that "[a]lthough
TPR proceedings would fall within the jurisdiction
of the Orphans' Court Division, these
cases are heard by the judge in Family Division
who presided over the dependency proceeding
under the `one judge[,] one family'
premise." Orphans' Court Opinion, 5/30/24,
at 28 (citing 42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 6351(i)(1)-(2) ("A
judge who adjudicated the child dependent or
who has conducted permanency hearings or
other dependency proceedings involving the
child may be assigned to the orphans' court
division for the purpose of hearing proceedings
relating to" TPR and adoption petitions)).

<fnt6> We also observe that guardians are specifically
limited in their decision-making power
with respect to TPR actions. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 20 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 5521(f)(2) (stating a guardian to an incapacitated
person is not permitted to consent "to
the relinquishment of the person's parental
rights.").

<fnt7> Even were we permitted to treat the non-precedential
decision Mother relies upon as
persuasive authority, it contradicts Mother's
claim that the appointment of a GAL cannot
be harmless error. <EMBI>See In re J.L.P.,</EMBI> 215 A.3d
627 (Pa. Super. 2019) (unpublished memorandum
at 11) ("Because [m]other had counsel
to represent her interests, and because she
was an adult, we agree that the court erred by
appointing a GAL. Nonetheless, it is clear that
the court's error was harmless.").

<fnt8> Mother's second claim would also fail because
the orphans' court "did not rely on
Mother's current physical incapacity during
the [Section] 2511(a) analysis[,] as there was
overwhelming evidence to support termination."
Orphans' Court Opinion, 5/30/24, at
27; <EMBI>see also id.</EMBI> at 27-28 (the orphans' court
detailing evidence of Mother's inability to satisfy
parental duties and responsibilities).

<fnt9> Because we agree with the orphans' court
that CYF met its burden with respect to Section
2511(a)(1), we need not address Mother's
issues four through six. <EMBI>See Int. of M.E.,</EMBI> 283
A.3d at 830.

[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <author>OLSON</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>In these consolidated cases, J.B. ("Father")
and H.M. ("Mother") (collectively,
"Parents") appeal from the January 29,
2024 orders entered in the Court of Common
<Page 244>
Pleas of Allegheny County that involuntarily
terminated their parental rights to
their biological daughters, Z.N.B., born in
February 2018, and N.F.B., born in November
2019, and their biological son,
C.A.M., born in November 2021 (collectively,
"the Children").<fnr1> After careful review,
we affirm.

<P20>The certified record reveals the following
relevant facts and procedural history.
The Allegheny County Office of Children,
Youth, and Families ("CYF" or "the Agency")
became involved with this family following
a February 21, 2020, report which
detailed that Mother contacted Z.N.B. and
N.F.B.'s aunt to care for Z.N.B. and N.F.B
while Mother was intoxicated. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Joint
Exhibit 1 at 2. When Mother later returned
to retrieve Z.N.B. and N.F.B. from
their aunt's care, police were contacted
and would not allow the aunt to release
Z.N.B. and N.F.B. to Mother's care due to
Mother's heavy intoxication. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Father is
a Tier III sexual offender and lifelong
registrant pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. Subchapter
H as a result of a 2001 conviction
for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse
against a nine-year-old girl.<fnr2> <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 1. Father
was sentenced to a term of incarceration
for a maximum sentence of fourteen
years and was on probation at the time of
the termination proceeding. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>; <EMBI>see also</EMBI>
CYF Exhibit 7; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> Orphans' Court
Opinion, 4/1/2024, at 3.

<P20>Z.N.B. and N.F.B. were taken into protective
custody by CYF on March 25, 2020,
and adjudicated dependent by the juvenile
court on May 11, 2020. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Joint Exhibit 1
at 1. At adjudication, the juvenile court
found aggravated circumstances as to Parents:
Father due to his status as a sex
offender and Mother due to four prior
involuntary terminations of her older children
not subject of these appeals. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 3.
Despite these findings, the Agency was not
relieved of its obligation to provide reasonable
efforts for reunification, which the
court established as Z.N.B. and N.F.B.'s
respective permanency goals. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>In furtherance of reunification, Father
was ordered to, <EM>inter alia</EM>: successfully
complete sex offender treatment; comply
with probation; complete intimate partner
violence ("IPV") treatment; and participate
in supervised visitation.<fnr3> <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 3-4; <EMBI>see
also</EMBI> Notes of Testimony ("N.T."),
1/11/2024, at 212. Mother was ordered to,
<EM>inter alia</EM>: achieve recovery from substance
abuse; complete non-offender's
treatment; complete IPV treatment; and
participate in supervised visitation. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
Joint Exhibit 1 at 3-4; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T.,
1/11/2024, at 202.

<P20>CYF first filed petitions to involuntarily
terminate Parents' parental rights to
Z.N.B. and N.F.B. on August 19, 2021,
before C.A.M.'s birth. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Joint Exhibit 1
at 5. Following a hearing, the orphans'
court denied the petitions on January 27,
2022, "due to progress by both parents at
that time and their participation in and
completion of various programs." <EMBI>See</EMBI> Orphans'
<Page 245>
Court Opinion, 4/1/2024, at 1-2. Notwithstanding,
Z.N.B and N.F.B.'s dependency
matters were not discharged, and
they were not returned to Parents' care.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 202. Z.N.B. and
N.F.B. were placed in their current pre-adoptive
foster home in July 2022, where
they remained at the time of the subject
termination proceedings. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Joint Exhibit
2 at 4; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 216.

<P20>In the interim, two days after C.A.M.'s
birth in November 2021, the court placed
him in the protective custody of CYF. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
Joint Exhibit 3 at 1. The juvenile court
adjudicated C.A.M. dependent on December
15, 2021. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Aggravated circumstances
were found as to Parents for the same
reasons as Z.N.B. and N.F.B. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 2. The
Agency was again ordered to provide reasonable
efforts for reunification, which was
set as C.A.M.'s respective permanency
goal. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Parents' permanency goals for
reunification remained as previously ordered.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 202, 212.
C.A.M. was placed in his current pre-adoptive
foster home separate from his older
siblings in December 2021 and remained
there at the time of the subject termination
proceedings. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Joint Exhibit 3 at
1; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 216.

<P20>Nevertheless, "[P]arents' progress did
not hold steady" following the orders denying
CYF's first termination petitions.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Orphans' Court Opinion, 4/1/2024, at 2.
As to Father, his supervised visitation initially
scheduled for once a week with 24-hour
confirmation, until it was suspended
in May 2023, after he struck Z.N.B. during
a visit, a complete explanation of which is
not included in the record. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T.,
1/11/2024, at 71-72, 76, 126, 182, 184, 215,
235-236; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T., 1/25/2024, at 89.
When visitation resumed in November
2023, it was weekly supervised therapeutic
visitation. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 181, 215,
236. Father attended approximately sixty
percent of his offered visitation. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 76-77;
<EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T., 1/25/2024, at 11-12.

<P20>As to Mother, she attended approximately
half of her required alcohol
screens. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 60-63, 66,
203. Mother also attended non-offender's
treatment twice with two different providers.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 86-87. Two therapists who
worked with Mother noted concerns about
her ability to put her education from the
treatment into practice. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 88, 105, 113,
148. Of additional concern to multiple witnesses
was Mother's lack of protective capacity,
in part due to her continuing relationship
with Father, despite the risks he
poses to the Children due to his sex offender
status. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 89, 102-103, 108-109,
134-135, 137, 210-211, 243.

<P20>Mother was granted "some" unsupervised
visitation in April 2022, with visits
restricted to her home beginning in August
2022. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Joint Exhibit 2 at 4; <EMBI>see
also</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 70, 74, 184-185. In
November 2022, visitation reverted back to
supervised at the Agency due to "Mother's
verbal aggression" with the Agency along
with Z.N.B.'s "behaviors."<fnr4> <EMBI>See</EMBI> Joint Exhibit
2 at 4; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 70,
74, 184-185; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> CYF Exhibits 4-6
(Permanency Review Orders, 12/12/22, at
3-4). Therapeutic visitation was implemented
for some of Mother's visits with Z.N.B.
and N.F.B. in September 2022. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T.,
1/11/2024, at 10.
<Page 246>

<P20>The frequency of Mother's offered visitation
fluctuated over the years the Children
were in care. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at
71, 182, 185; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> Joint Exhibit 3 at 2.
Mother repeatedly failed to appear at supervised
visitation since August 2022. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
at 72-74, 76, 80, 182-183; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T.,
1/25/2024, at 13. Ultimately, Mother's supervised
visitation was reduced to once a
week around October 2023, which it remained
at the time of the termination
hearings. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 71, 182. In total, Mother
attended approximately half of her offered
visitation. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 76; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T.,
1/25/2024, at 12-13.

<P20>On May 19, 2023, CYF filed petitions to
involuntarily terminate the parental rights
of Parents to the Children based upon
these new circumstances. With respect to
Father, CYF filed pursuant to 23 Pa.
C.S.A. &sect; 2511(a)(2), (5), (8), (11) and (b).
With respect to Mother, CYF filed pursuant
to 23 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2511(a)(1), (2), (5),
(8), and (b).

<P20>The involuntary termination proceedings
took place over two days: January 11 and
25, 2024. The Children, who were five,
four, and two years old, respectively, were
represented by KidsVoice.<fnr5> CYF presented
the following witnesses in support of its
petitions to involuntarily terminate Parents'
parental rights: Paris Sionis-Litvik,
psychotherapist at Mon Yough who provided
therapeutic visitation for Mother; Erica
Votodian, John Oldham, and Tyler Manuel,
investigators at Corporate Securities Investigation
("CSI"); Tarraca Jackson, supervisor
at Allegheny County Health Department
lab; Holly Gutherie, C.A.M.'s
case manager at Aubrele; Janelle Crisp,
therapist at Crisp Forensic Counseling;
Eric Bernstein, Psy.D., expert in forensic
psychology; Claire Chiavarini, supervisor
of Z.N.B. and N.F.B.'s case manager at
Mon Yough; and Stacey Policicchio, CYF
caseworker. Mother testified on her own
behalf. Father testified on his own behalf
and presented the following witnesses:
Bruce Goldhagen, family resource specialist
with Justice Works; and S.B., Father's
mother.

<P20>By orders dated January 25, 2024, and
entered on January 29, 2024, the orphans'
court involuntarily terminated Parents' parental
rights to the Children pursuant to
23 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2511(a)(2), (8) and (b). Additionally,
the orphans' court terminated Father's
parental rights to the Children pursuant
to 23 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2511(a)(11).

<P20>Parents separately and timely filed notices
of appeal and concise statements of
errors complained of on appeal pursuant to
Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a)(2)(i) and (b).<fnr6> The trial
<Page 247>
court filed its Rule 1925(a) opinion on April
1, 2024.

<P20>Father presents the following issues on
appeal for our review:

<B24>1. Did the [orphans'] court abuse its
discretion and/or err as a matter of
law in granting the petition to involuntarily
terminate Father's parental
rights pursuant to Pa.C.S.[A.]
&sect; 2511(a)(2), (8), and (11)?

<B24>2. Did the [orphans'] court abuse its
discretion and/or err as a matter of
law in concluding that CYF met its
burden of [proof] by clear and convincing
evidence that termination of
Father's parental rights would best
serve the needs and welfare of the
[C]hildren pursuant to Pa.C.S.[A.]
&sect; 2511(b)?

<P00>Father's Brief at 3.

<P20>Mother presents the following issues on
appeal for our review:

<B24>1. Did the [orphans'] court abuse its
discretion and/or err as a matter of
law in granting the petition to involuntarily
terminate Mother's parental
rights pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S.[A.]
&sect; 2511(a)(2) and (8)?

<B24>2. Did the [orphans'] court abuse its
discretion and/or err as a matter of
law in concluding that CYF met its
burden of [proof] by clear and convincing
evidence that termination of
Mother's parental rights would best
serve the needs and welfare of the
[C]hildren pursuant to 23 Pa.
C.S.[A.] &sect; 2511(b)?

<B24>3. Whether the [orphans'] court abused
its discretion and/or erred as a matter
of law in failing to identify the
conflict of interest between
[Z.N.B.'s] position and the position
advocated by [Z.N.B.'s] legal counsel
therefore depriving [her] of the right
to effective legal counsel.

<P00>Mother's Brief at 10.

<P20>With respect to Parents' claims
challenging the sufficiency of the evidence
as it relates to the termination of their
parental rights, our standard of review in
this context is well-established:

<B22>In cases concerning the involuntary termination
of parental rights, appellate review
is limited to a determination of
whether the decree of the termination
court is supported by competent evidence.
When applying this standard, the
appellate court must accept the trial
court's findings of fact and credibility
determinations if they are supported by
the record. Where the trial court's factual
findings are supported by the evidence,
an appellate court may not disturb
the trial court's ruling unless it has
discerned an error of law or abuse of
discretion.

<B22>An abuse of discretion does not result
merely because the reviewing court
might have reached a different conclusion
or the facts could support an opposite
result. Instead, an appellate court
may reverse for an abuse of discretion
only upon demonstration of manifest unreasonableness,
partiality, prejudice,
bias, or ill-will. This standard of review
reflects the deference we pay to trial
courts, who often observe the parties
first-hand across multiple hearings.
<Page 248>

<B22>In considering a petition to terminate
parental rights, a trial court must balance
the parent's fundamental right to
make decisions concerning the care, custody,
and control of his or her child with
the child's essential needs for a parent's
care, protection, and support. Termination
of parental rights has significant
and permanent consequences for both
the parent and child. As such, the law of
this Commonwealth requires the moving
party to establish the statutory grounds
by clear and convincing evidence, which
is evidence that is so clear, direct,
weighty, and convincing as to enable a
trier of fact to come to a clear conviction,
without hesitance, of the truth of
the precise facts in issue.

<P00><EMBI>Interest of M.E.,</EMBI> 283 A.3d 820, 829-30 (Pa.
Super. 2022) (cleaned up).

<P20>The involuntary termination of parental
rights is governed by Section 2511 of the
Adoption Act, which calls for a bifurcated
analysis that first focuses upon the "eleven
enumerated grounds" of parental conduct
that may warrant termination. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 830;
<EMBI>see also</EMBI> 23 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2511(a)(1)-(11). If
the orphans' court determines the petitioner
has established grounds for termination
under one of these subsections by "clear
and convincing evidence," the court then
assesses the petition pursuant to Section
2511(b), which focuses upon the child's developmental,
physical, and emotional needs
and welfare. <EMBI>In re T.S.M.,</EMBI> 620 Pa. 602, 71
A.3d 251, 267 (2013); <EMBI>see also</EMBI> 23 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 2511(b).

<P20>Our analysis in these appeals will focus
upon Sections 2511(a)(2), (11), and (b),<fnr7>
which provide as follows:

<B22><EMB>(a) General Rule.</EMB>&mdash;The rights of a parent
in regard to a child may be terminated
after a petition filed on any of the
following grounds:

<C5>...

<B44>(2) The repeated and continued incapacity,
abuse, neglect or refusal of the
parent has caused the child to be
without essential parental care, control
or subsistence necessary for his
physical or mental well-being and the
conditions and causes of the incapacity,
abuse, neglect or refusal cannot or
will not be remedied by the parent.

<C5>...

<B44>(11) The parent is required to register
as a sexual offender under 42 Pa.
C.S.[A.] Ch. 97 Subch. H (relating to
registration of sexual offenders) or I
(relating to continued registration of
sexual offenders) or to register with a
sexual offender registry in another jurisdiction
or foreign country.

<C5>...

<B22><EMB>(b) Other considerations.</EMB>&mdash;The court
in terminating the rights of a parent
shall give primary consideration to the
developmental, physical and emotional
needs and welfare of the child. The
rights of a parent shall not be terminated
solely on the basis of environmental
factors such as inadequate housing, furnishings,
income, clothing and medical
care if found to be beyond the control of
the parent. With respect to any petition
filed pursuant to subsection (a)(1), (6) or
(8), the court shall not consider any efforts
by the parent to remedy the conditions
described therein which are first
<Page 249>
initiated subsequent to the giving of notice
of the filing of the petition.

<P00>23 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2511(a)(2), (11), (b).

<P20>In order to satisfy Section
2511(a)(2), the petitioning party must establish:
"(1) repeated and continued incapacity,
abuse, neglect or refusal; (2) that
such incapacity, abuse, neglect or refusal
caused the child to be without essential
parental care, control or subsistence; and
(3) that the causes of the incapacity, abuse,
neglect or refusal cannot or will not be
remedied." <EMBI>In re Adoption of A.H.,</EMBI> 247
A.3d 439, 443 (Pa. Super. 2021). Grounds
for termination pursuant to section
2511(a)(2), however, "are not limited to
affirmative misconduct, but concern parental
incapacity that cannot be remedied."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (citing <EMBI>In re Z.P.,</EMBI> 994 A.2d 1108, 1117
(Pa. Super. 2010)). In reviewing the orphans'
court's findings pursuant to section
2511(a)(2), we remain mindful that "[p]arents
are required to make diligent efforts
toward the reasonably prompt assumption
of full parental duties." <EMBI>A.H.,</EMBI> 247 A.3d at
443.

<P20>As to Section 2511(a)(11), this
Court has observed that "[t]he language of
the statute provides that, when the parent
is required to register as a sexual offender,
the court may terminate the parent's
rights." <EMBI>Interest of R.C.,</EMBI> 283 A.3d 380,
2022 WL 2815368, at *6 (Pa. Super. July
19, 2022) (non-precedential decision) (emphasis
omitted). Of particular note, "Section
2511(a)(11) does not mandate further
inquiry into the parents' actions. The sole
condition is that the parent is required to
register as a sexual offender." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (citing
<EMBI>Interest of Z.F.Q.,</EMBI> 272 A.3d 451, 2022 WL
34288, at *3 (Pa. Super. Jan. 4, 2022) (non-precedential
decision)). Indeed, this Court
has strongly suggested that litigants are
"estopped" from challenging the validity of
their registration status, or the underlying
criminal convictions, in parental termination
proceedings. <EMBI>Z.F.Q.,</EMBI> 272 A.3d at *4.

<P20>If the orphans' court concludes that adequate
grounds for termination exist pursuant
to Section 2511(a), the court then turns
to Section 2511(b), which requires that it
"give primary consideration to the developmental,
physical and emotional needs
and welfare of the child." 23 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 2511(b); <EMBI>see also T.S.M.,</EMBI> 71 A.3d at 267.
Our Supreme Court has generally outlined
this inquiry as follows:

<B22>[C]ourts should consider the matter
from the child's perspective, placing her
developmental, physical, and emotional
needs and welfare above concerns for
the parent.

<B22>Accordingly, the determination of the
child's particular developmental, physical,
and emotional needs and welfare
must be made on a case-by-case basis.
We have observed the law regarding
termination of parental rights should not
be applied mechanically but instead always
with an eye to the best interests
and the needs and welfare of the particular
children involved. Thus, the court
must determine each child's specific
needs.

<B22>Moreover, the child's emotional needs
and welfare include intangibles such as
love, comfort, security, and stability. As
further guidance, we have identified factors,
<EM>i.e.,</EM> specific needs and aspects of
the child's welfare, that trial courts must
always consider. The courts must consider
whether the children are in a pre-adoptive
home and whether they have a
bond with their foster parents. And, if
the child has any bond with the biological
parent, the court must conduct an
analysis of that bond, which is not always
an easy task.

<P00><EMBI>Interest of K.T.,</EMBI> ___ Pa. ___, 296 A.3d
1085, 1105-06 (2023) (cleaned up).
<Page 250>

<P20>The Court further explained that "[i]t is
only a necessary and beneficial bond, after
all, that should be maintained." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 1109.
The Court highlighted that orphans' courts
"must evaluate whether maintaining the
bond serves the child's developmental,
physical, and emotional needs and welfare."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Such evaluation includes consideration
of "the effect of severing a child's
bond with her parent." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> The <EMBI>K.T.</EMBI> Court
described the "severance of a necessary
and beneficial relationship [as] the kind of
loss that would predictably cause `extreme
emotional consequences' or significant, irreparable
harm." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 1109-10 (citing <EMBI>In
re E.M.,</EMBI> 533 Pa. 115, 620 A.2d 481, 484
(1993) (subsequent citations omitted)). The
Court recognized that bond, permanency,
stability, and all other intangibles are "all
of `primary' importance in the Section
2511(b) analysis." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 1109.

<P20>In considering the affection which
a child may have for his or her natural
parents, this Court has stated the following:

<B22>[C]oncluding a child has a beneficial
bond with a parent simply because the
child harbors affection for the parent is
not only dangerous, it is logically unsound.
If a child's feelings were the dispositive
factor in the bonding analysis,
the analysis would be reduced to an
exercise in semantics as it is the rare
child who, after being subject to neglect
and abuse, is able to sift through the
emotional wreckage and completely disavow
a parent.... Nor are we of the
opinion that the biological connection between
[the parent] and the children is
sufficient in of itself, or when considered
in connection with a child's feeling toward
a parent, to establish a <EM>de facto</EM>
beneficial bond exists. The psychological
aspect of parenthood is more important
in terms of the development of the child
and its mental and emotional health than
the coincidence of biological or natural
parenthood.

<P00><EMBI>In re K.K.R.-S.,</EMBI> 958 A.2d 529, 535 (Pa.
Super. 2008) (internal citations and quotation
marks omitted). This Court has clarified
that it is "within the discretion of the
orphans' court to prioritize the safety and
security" of children "over their bonds
with their parents." <EMBI>M.E.,</EMBI> 283 A.3d at 839
(cleaned up). It is within the province of
the orphans' court to "consider the totality
of the circumstances when performing a
needs and welfare analysis." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> We will
not disturb such an assessment if the orphans'
court's factual findings are supported
by the record. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>With respect to Father's challenge
to Section 2511(a)(11), Father argues that
the trial court had discretion to determine,
and therefore was not mandated, to terminate
Father's parental rights due to his
status as a sex offender.<fnr8> <EMBI>See</EMBI> Father's
Brief at 18. Specifically, Father argues
that his status as a sex offender "must be
weighed against the best needs and welfare
of the Children" because he "has
made significant progress in his sex offender
treatment and currently exhibits a
low risk of recidivism." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>The orphans' court summarized its relevant
findings as follows:

<B22>In this case, no party disputes that Father
is required to register as a sex
offender.... [T]he evidence is clear and
convincing that Father cannot surmount
this hurdle with the superficial progress
he made.

<P00>Orphans' Court Opinion, 4/1/2024, at 16.

<P20>As noted above, Section
2511(a)(11) allows the orphans' court to
<Page 251>
terminate parental rights upon clear and
convincing evidence that a parent is required
to register as a sex offender. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 23
Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2511(a)(11). As Father argues,
this provision affords the court discretion
to terminate based upon a parent's requirement
to register as a sex offender
because the term "may" is permissive. <EMBI>See
Lorino v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd.,</EMBI>
___ Pa. ___, 266 A.3d 487, 493 (2021)
("The term `shall' establishes a mandatory
duty, whereas the term `may' connotates
an act that is permissive, but not mandated
or required."). The straightforward language
of Section 2511(a)(11) solely requires
that the court determine whether
the petitioner proved the "parent is required
to register as a sexual offender
under 42 Pa.C.S. Ch. 97 subsection H (registration
of sexual offenders) or I (continued
registration of sexual offenders) or a
registry in another jurisdiction or county."
<EMBI>See</EMBI> 23 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2511(a)(11). Father's
argument that his sex offender status must
be weighed against the needs and welfare
of the Children pertains to Section 2511(b),
which will be addressed <EM>infra.</EM>

<P20>Instantly, the orphans' court concluded
the undisputed, joint stipulation between
CYF and Father that he is a Tier III
sexual offender and a lifelong registrant,
along with Father's criminal record to the
underlying offense, established that Father
was required to register as a sex
offender. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Joint Exhibit 4 at 2; <EMBI>see also</EMBI>
CYF Exhibit 7. This alone was sufficient to
establish grounds for termination under
Section 2511(a)(11). Thus, we discern no
abuse of discretion or error of law in the
orphans' court holding that termination
was warranted as to Father pursuant to
Section 2511(a)(11).

<P20>With respect to Mother's challenge
to Section 2511(a)(2), she contests
the sufficiency of the evidence. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Mother's
Brief at 25. Specifically, Mother asserts
that the record was devoid of evidence
that she was using alcohol, unable to
protect the Children, or that she was communicating
with Father beyond a co-parenting
relationship. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 25-26. We disagree.

<P20>The orphans' court summarized its relevant
findings as follows:

<B22>Mother fared ... poorly with her attendance
at drug screens required to
ensure her sobriety. Mother attended
only about half of her screens, and from
August of 2022 onward, her no-shows
increased.

<C5>...

<B22>Given that the concern was alcohol, no
show &mdash; not appearing was a significant
concern for the [c]ourt because of the
lack of time that alcohol would remain in
her system ... [T]he inconsistency
leaves the [c]ourt with no other way of
managing the requirement to attend the
screen[s] and the failure to do so with a
concern that [M]other perhaps had relapsed.

<C5>...

<B22>Mother did attend non-offender treatment,
but she did not demonstrate reliability
in putting theory into practice, as
she continued to have a relationship with
Father, turning to him repeatedly as a
support system despite the risks to the
Children. Mother compounded the problem
by being dishonest about her contact
with Father on multiple occasions.

<P00>Orphans' Court Opinion, 4/1/2024, at 21-22;
<EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T., 1/25/2024, at 142-143.

<P20>The orphans' court findings are supported
by the record evidence. It is clearly
established that Mother suffers from repeated
and continued incapacities or refusals,
namely, her alcohol abuse issues and
her lack of capacity to protect the Children.
Ms. Policicchio, the CYF caseworker,
testified that the Agency's concerns about
<Page 252>
Mother's alcohol abuse and lack of protective
capacity, in part due to her continuing
relationship with Father, persisted at the
time of the termination proceedings. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
N.T., 1/11/2024, at 203, 205-206, 210-212.

<P20>The Agency has been aware of Mother's
alcohol abuse since 2010 based on its involvement
with Mother's older children.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 202; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> Joint Exhibit 3 at 2.
Mother participated in two treatment programs
during the Children's dependency
proceedings: one at Pennsylvania Organization
for Women in Early Recovery
("POWER"), which she attended around
March 2020 and did not successfully complete;
and one at Gateway, which she did
successfully complete in March 2022. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
N.T., 1/11/2024, at 202-203; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T.,
1/25/2024, at 35, 75-76.

<P20>Ms. Jackson of Allegheny County
Health Department testified that Mother
was called in for alcohol urine screens
ninety-seven times since January 2022. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
N.T., 1/11/2024, at 66. Mother attended
fifty-four screens and failed to appear forty-three
times. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Mother failed to appear
at screens for multiple weeks at a time
with large gaps in attendance, resulting in
the Agency's concern about continued alcohol
use. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 62-63, 203. Further, the
juvenile court provided Mother the opportunity
to be relieved of the obligation to
provide screens if she provided eight consecutive
screens, but Mother never complied
with the court's offer. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 204; <EMBI>see
also</EMBI> N.T., 1/25/2024, at 40. The last screen
Mother attended was October 25, 2023, no-showing
for all subsequent screens, even
after the termination petitions had been
filed. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 61. Mother
blamed her nonattendance at the screens
on multiple reasons, which the orphans'
court did not find credible.<fnr9> <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T.,
1/25/2024, at 38-40; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> Orphans'
Court Opinion, 4/1/2024, at 23. Indeed, the
competent evidence supports the orphans'
court's finding that Mother has not overcome
her alcohol abuse issues.

<P20>As to Mother's lack of protective capacity,
the primary concern was her continued
relationship with Father due to his sex
offender status. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 89,
102-103, 108-109, 134-135, 137, 210-211,
243. Mother had been proven to be dishonest
about her relationship with Father regarding
C.A.M.'s paternity, claiming
C.A.M.'s father was deceased until Father
ultimately admitted to paternity. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
206, 226, 239. Mother's counselor Ms.
Crisp testified that she was "very concerned"
about Mother's "lack of honesty"
regarding Father. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 92, 111. Concerns
about Parents' honesty regarding their
continued relationship persisted, and the
Agency enlisted CSI to surveil Parents. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
at 26, 205-206, 226. CSI conducted approximately
three periods of surveillance from
December 2021 until about April 2023. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
at 26, 28. Three CSI investigators testified
to observing Father's vehicles, along with
him coming and going from Mother's residence
on numerous occasions, which the
orphans' court found credible. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 29-30,
34-36, 45-47; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> Orphans' Court
Opinion, 4/1/2024, at 23. Ms. Policicchio
testified that she would not expect Parents
to be together as often as they were observed
if they were strictly co-parenting.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 241.

<P20>The concern about Mother's lack of protective
capacity due to her ongoing relationship
<Page 253>
with Father is best summarized
by Ms. Crisp, as follows:

<B22>So my concern is that [Mother] knows
the non-offender content. We went over
it almost weekly for [eleven] months. I
know she knew the risk of making her
support person[, Father,] that has Megan's
Law [r]egistration with the kids.
For her children, whether she has custody
of them or not. So ... my concern is
that she didn't care ... she was putting
her support person before the concern
of what CYF was going to have to say
about or what the hearing officer or
[j]udge is going to have to say about it
or what I have to say about it or anyone
else.

<C5>...

<B22>I do agree that support matters with
relapse prevention in terms of drug and
alcohol.... But at what cost?

<P00>N.T., 1/11/2024, at 102-103. Dr. Berstein
echoed these concerns, stating one of the
issues with Mother's protective capacity is
the translation of her education from non-offender's
treatment into actions and
whether she would prioritize the Children's
safety over "compromising any contact
or relationship with [Father]." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
135, 138, 148. Ms. Policicchio expressed the
same concerns. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 210-211. Mother dismisses
these concerns as "speculative," but
we must disagree as the concerns were
corroborated by multiple witnesses. Mother's
claim that she is strictly in a co-parenting
relationship with Father is belied
by the foregoing testimonial evidence.

<P20>Further, Mother's responses to Z.N.B.'s
sexual acting out and allegations of sexual
abuse contributed to Mother's lack of protective
capacity. Z.N.B. made sexual allegations
against a brother who is not subject
to the instant appeals. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T.,
1/11/2024, at 13. Mother denied these allegations
and proceeded to bring this brother
to a visit with Z.N.B. after the allegations
were made. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 14, 209, 211, 214.
Dr. Bernstein and Ms. Policicchio detailed
an extensive collection of behaviors that
evidenced Z.N.B. had been sexually acting
out, as discussed <EM>supra,</EM> and Mother again
denied the allegations and even delayed
Z.N.B. receiving therapy by refusing to
provide consent. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 157-158, 208-209,
230-232.

<P20>The foregoing evidence clearly supports
the court's finding that Mother lacked the
protective capacity to care for the Children.
We, therefore, readily conclude that
the totality of the previously detailed evidence
establishes that Mother suffered
from repeated and continued parental incapacities
or refusals, which have caused
the Children to be without essential parental
care, control, and subsistence.

<P20>Likewise, the certified record thoroughly
supports the conclusion that Mother has
resolved neither her alcohol abuse nor her
lack of protective capacity. Mother has
been involved with the Agency for well
over a decade due to her alcohol abuse and
the competent evidence discussed above
supports the orphans' court conclusion that
Mother cannot or will not remedy this
issue. Further, the Agency provided ample
evidence, also discussed above, that Mother's
lack of protective capacity persisted
despite Mother's completion of non-offender's
treatment twice over the many years
the Children have been removed from her
care.

<P20>This evidence and testimony support the
orphans' court's conclusion that Mother's
incapacities or refusals related to alcohol
abuse and lack of protective capacity cannot,
or will not, be remedied. Accordingly,
we observe no abuse of discretion or error
of law in the orphans' court holding that
termination was warranted pursuant to
Section 2511(a)(2).
<Page 254>

<P20>Parents advance identical arguments
for their challenges to the orphans'
court's findings pursuant to Section
2511(b). Specifically, Parents assert that
"the sole expert witness testified that [Parents]
fulfill an important connection for
[the] Children" and "[t]he Children derive
invaluable and irreplaceable benefits from
[Parents'] love, affection, and familial ancestry
from their relationship with [Parents.]"
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Father's Brief at 20; <EMBI>see also</EMBI>
Mother's Brief at 29 (cleaned up). We must
disagree.

<P20>The orphans' court summarized its relevant
findings as follows:

<B22>By all accounts, [the] Children have loving,
supportive foster homes and are
nicely bonded to their foster parents. As
to their bonds with [Parents], this
[c]ourt credited and agreed with Dr.
Bernstein's testimony that while those
bonds exist, they are not necessary, and
none the Children would suffer a serious
detriment by termination of [Parents']
rights. What would be detrimental for
[Z.N.B. and N.F.B] would be causing
them to continue in their state of instability
after four years in limbo. Similarly,
[C.A.M.] is strongly bonded to his
foster parents and is likely to suffer
trauma if that bond is broken, not if
[Parents'] rights are terminated.

<P00>Orphans' Court Opinion, 4/1/2024, at 26-27.

<P20>The orphans' court's findings are supported
by the record evidence. Father attended
thirty-eight out of sixty-nine visits
offered through Aubrele and twenty-three
out of thirty-five visits offered through
Mon Yough.<fnr10> <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 76;
<EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T., 1/25/2024, at 11-12. Mr.
Sionis-Litvik testified that Z.N.B. and
N.F.B. did not convey positive sentiments
towards Father and expressed not wanting
to visit with him due to being "hit" by him.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 23. Dr. Bernstein
testified that the Children look to Father
as "having fun and receiving support during
isolated visit[ation] period[s]," not relying
on him as their psychological parent,
although Z.N.B. and N.F.B. do recognize
him as their father. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 125. Dr. Bernstein
testified that C.A.M. is less likely to
recognize Father as his father. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Mother attended fifty-two out of ninety-five
visits offered through Aubrele and
seventy out of 128 visits offered through
Mon Yough. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 76; <EMBI>see
also</EMBI> N.T., 1/25/2024, at 12. Mother did not
attend any available visitation with Z.N.B.
and N.F.B. from October 28, 2023 until
January 9, 2024, two days before the beginning
of the termination proceedings.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 188. Mother testified
that she missed visits due to an array
of reasons, which again the orphans' court
did not find credible.<fnr11> <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/25/2024,
at 48-50, 60; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> Orphans' Court Opinion,
4/1/2024, at 23. Several witnesses stated
that Mother's repeated failure to appear
had negative impacts on the Children,
causing them to feel emotions such as disappointment,
confusion, anger, and self-blame.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 15, 135-136;
<EMBI>see also</EMBI> 1/25/2024, at 13. Dr. Bernstein
testified that the Children recognize her as
their mother, responded to her support,
and N.F.B. was affectionate with her. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
at 125-126.

<P20>Accordingly, we discern no abuse of discretion
by the orphans' court finding the
<Page 255>
bonds between Parents and the Children
were not necessary and beneficial. There is
some evidence that the Children harbor
affection for Parents, but this is not sufficient
to find a necessary and beneficial
bond between Parents and the Children.
<EMBI>See K.K.R.-S.,</EMBI> 958 A.2d at 535. Indeed, Dr.
Bernstein declined to describe the bonds
between Parents and the Children as necessary
and beneficial when specifically
questioned on the topic, stating that was
not his position. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at
132-133, 137-138. As the orphans' court
detailed in its findings above, it conducted
the required consideration of the effect
termination of parental rights would have
on the Children and credited Dr. Bernstein's
testimony that the Children would
not suffer extreme emotional consequences
as a result. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 144-145; <EMBI>see also K.T.,</EMBI>
296 A.3d at 1109-10.

<P20>Further, the orphans' court aptly considered
the Children's need for permanency.
There is no dispute that Z.N.B. and N.F.B.
had been removed from Parents' care for
four years and C.A.M. the entirety of his
two years of life. Z.N.B. and N.F.B. have
been with their pre-adoptive foster parent
since July 2022, and C.A.M. has consistently
been placed with his pre-adoptive foster
parent since December 2021. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Joint
Exhibit 2 at 4; <EMBI>See</EMBI> Joint Exhibit 3 at 1; <EMBI>see
also</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 216. The orphans'
court also considered the Children's bonds
with their respective foster parents, as
noted above, which was testified to by
multiple witnesses who described how the
Children have strong bonds to their foster
parents and are well cared for by them.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 75-76, 139-141, 144-145,
208-209, 217.

<P20>Based upon the testimonial evidence set
forth above, we discern no abuse of discretion
or error of law in the orphans' court's
conclusion that CYF met their evidentiary
burden pursuant to section 2511(b). Our
Supreme Court stated in <EMBI>K.T.</EMBI> that the
considerations that contribute to an orphans'
court's Section 2511(b) analysis are
all of primary importance. <EMBI>K.T.,</EMBI> 296 A.3d
at 1109. Instantly, the orphans' court made
all the requisite considerations as part of
its analysis. Moreover, the orphans' court
was within their discretion to prioritize the
Children's intangibles, including their safety
and security, over their bond with Parents.
<EMBI>M.E.,</EMBI> 283 A.3d at 839. Thus, we
affirm the orphan's court's findings with
respect to termination of Parent's parental
rights.

<P20>With respect to Mother's issue regarding
the Children's legal counsel, we
note that the requirements of 23 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 2313(a) were met, as addressed <EM>supra.</EM>
Preliminarily, we note that Mother does
not raise issues with respect to N.F.B. or
C.A.M.'s legal counsel in her concise statements
or in her statement of questions
involved in her appellate brief. Accordingly,
this issue as to N.F.B. and C.A.M. is
waived. <EMBI>See In re M.Z.T.M.W.,</EMBI> 163 A.3d
462, 466 (Pa. Super. 2017) (reiterating that
issues not included in a concise statement
of errors complained of on appeal and
statement of questions involved are
waived).

<P20>We discern that Mother's argument is
essentially that Attorney Cersosimo of
KidsVoice failed to advocate for Z.N.B.'s
legal interests. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Mother's Brief at 32.
Specifically, Mother baldly asserts that
"the record is clear that [Z.N.B.] wanted
to reunify with Mother." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> We disagree.

<P20>Our Supreme Court has held that "[a]n
attorney acting as a child's legal counsel
must, at a minimum, attempt to ascertain
the child's preference and advocate on the
child's behalf," legal counsel for a child is
accorded "significant deference" in their
role. <EMBI>In re P.G.F,</EMBI> 665 Pa. 37, 247 A.3d 955,
966 (2021). Attorney Cersosimo provided
<Page 256>
the orphans' court with the following relevant
explanation:

<B22>I recently had the chance to visit with
[the Children].... As for five-year-old
[Z.N.B.], we were able to discuss her
forever home and what it would mean to
be adopted. Based on this conversation,
[Z.N.B.] was able to express a desire to
be adopted.

<P00>N.T., 1/25/2024, at 134-135. Attorney Cersosimo's
approach was consistent with our
case law. <EMBI>See P.G.F,</EMBI> 247 A.3d at 966 ("[w]e
will not mandate that an attorney convey
highly sensitive, significant, and potentially
emotionally damaging information to a
child, or engage in a raw inquiry, merely
to discern the clearest indication of a
child's preference"); <EMBI>see also In re T.S.,</EMBI>
648 Pa. 236, 192 A.3d 1080, 1082 n.2 (2018)
("`[l]egal interests' denotes that an attorney
is to express the child's wishes to the
court regardless of whether the attorney
agrees with the child's recommendation").

<P20>Mother relies on <EMBI>In the Interest of
D.N.G.,</EMBI> 230 A.3d 361 (Pa. Super. 2020), but
the case <EM>sub judice</EM> is clearly distinguishable.
In <EMBI>D.N.G.,</EMBI> this Court found that the
eleven-year-old child's legal counsel failed
to zealously advocate for the child's legal
interests when counsel advised the court of
the child's unequivocal preference not to
be adopted, yet advocated for termination.
<EMBI>D.N.G.,</EMBI> 230 A.3d at 367. Instantly, Attorney
Cersosimo ascertained five-year-old
Z.N.B.'s preference, which was for adoption.
Most importantly, Mother fails to cite
any record evidence as to her claim that
the record clearly showed that Z.N.B.
wanted to reunify with her. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Mother's
Brief at 32. This Court's careful review of
the certified record revealed no such
"clear" evidence.<fnr12> The record evidence
does not contradict counsel's assertion of
Z.N.B.'s desire. Accordingly, Mother's arguments
lack factual basis, legal basis, and
merit. As such, we discern no abuse of
discretion or error of law in the orphans'
court's appointment of KidsVoice's continued
dual representation for the Children.

<P20>Thus, we affirm the decrees pursuant to
23 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2511(a)(2), (11), and (b).

<P20>Decrees affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt1> This Court <EM>sua sponte</EM> consolidated the separate
notices of appeal filed by Father and
Mother. Because Parents raise identical
claims to the Children concerning the same
factual and procedural events, we address
their appeals together in this opinion.

<fnt2> Father's convicted offense of involuntary deviate
sexual intercourse is a Tier III sexual
offense pursuant to Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9799.14(d)(4).
This offense requires lifetime registration. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9799.15(a)(3) ("An individual convicted
of a Tier III sexual offense shall register
for the life of the individual").

<fnt3> Father was only to participate in supervised
visitation after "obtain[ing] information regarding
[a criminal court trial judge's] order
that he can have contact with his children."
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Joint Exhibit 1. The case from which this
order originates is unclear from the certified
record.

<fnt4> Z.N.B.'s behaviors were being physically aggressive
with N.F.B., discussing death and
"people dying," and sexualized behaviors. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
CYF Exhibits 4-6 (Permanency Review Orders,
12/12/22, at 2). Z.N.B.'s sexualized behaviors
included: "speaking about adult sexual
information, shaking her butt, arching her
back, pantomiming humping and showing
[N.F.B.] her genitals," kissing a peer at
school, drawing "sexual things," and acting
sexual behaviors out in play with dolls. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>;
<EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 157-158, 230-232.

<fnt5> The certified record reveals that the juvenile
court appointed KidsVoice, the Children's
guardian <EM>ad litem</EM> ("GAL") from the underlying
dependency proceedings, as their legal
counsel for the termination proceedings by
separate orders dated August 1, 2023. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
Orders Appointing Legal Counsel for a Child
in a TPR Proceeding, 8/1/2023. In these orders,
the juvenile court specifically found that
"no conflict exists that would prevent KidsVoice
from accepting this appointment." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
Lexus Cersosimo, Esquire, of KidsVoice represented
the Children's best and legal interests
at the termination proceedings. Accordingly,
the requirements of 23 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 2313(a) are met. <EMBI>See In re K.M.G.,</EMBI> 663 Pa.
53, 240 A.3d 1218, 1236, 1238 (2020) (holding
appellate courts should engage in "limited
<EM>sua sponte</EM> review" concerning a child's statutory
right to counsel in the termination context
and mandating the orphans' court issue a
separate order appointing counsel to represent
the legal interests of a child involved in
an involuntary termination matter and, if the
appointed counsel also serves as GAL, to determine
"prior to appointment" whether the
child's dual interests did not conflict).

<fnt6> On February 22, 2024, Father timely filed a
singular notice of appeal with respect to the
decrees, docketed at 241 WDA 2024, which
failed to comply with <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Walker,</EMBI> 646 Pa. 456, 185 A.3d 969 (2018),
wherein our Supreme Court held that appellants
are required to file separate notices of
appeal when a single order resolves issues
arising on more than one lower court docket.
On March 15, 2024, this Court directed Father's
counsel to file amended separate notices
of appeal pursuant to <EMBI>Walker,</EMBI> and Father
complied. <EMBI>See Commonwealth v. Young,</EMBI>
280 A.3d 1049, 1057 (Pa. Super. 2022) (holding
that, regarding a <EMBI>Walker</EMBI> defect in an
appeal to which Pa.R.A.P. 902 applies, the
default position is to allow for correction of
the defect unless good cause is shown by the
opposing party).

<fnt7> This Court need only agree with the orphans'
court's determination as to any one
subsection of Section 2511(a), in addition to
Section 2511(b), in order to affirm termination.
<EMBI>See M.E.,</EMBI> 283 A.3d at 830 (citing <EMBI>In re
B.L.W.,</EMBI> 843 A.2d 380, 384 (Pa. Super. 2004)
(<EM>en banc</EM>)). Based on this disposition, we need
not consider Parents' arguments with respect
to the additional subsections of 2511(a).

<fnt8> We note that Father's sole legal authority
cited, <EMBI>In re K.M.L.,</EMBI> 2018 Pa. Super. Unpub.
LEXIS 1178 (Pa. Super. 2018), is a non-precedential
decision that pre-dates May 1, 2019.
Thus, it does not have persuasive value pursuant
to Pa. OP Super. Ct. 65.37(b).

<fnt9> Mother blamed her nonattendance on:
scheduling issues with work, although she
refused to provide CYF with her work schedule;
complaints that she could not attend at
the same time for every screen, although CYF
stated they would not be truly random if they
were regularly scheduled; and not reading her
emails. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/25/2024, at 38-40; <EMBI>see also</EMBI>
N.T., 1/11/2024, at 204, 227, 241.

<fnt10> Aubrele is C.A.M.'s foster care agency.
Mon Yough is Z.N.B. and N.F.B.'s foster care
agency.

<fnt11> Mother testified that she missed visits due
to sickness, mental health issues, car troubles,
feeling "unsafe" with her case manager from
Mon Yough, being "stuck" babysitting other
children, and prioritizing work over her visitation
with the Children. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/25/2024,
at 48-50, 60.

<fnt12> As Mother left this Court to scour the certified
record for this alleged evidence, we best
discern that she is referencing testimony from
Mr. Sionis-Litvik which discussed how Z.N.B.
questioned when she would return home,
without clarifying which home she was referencing.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 1/11/2024, at 12. Mr. Sionis-Litvik
further explained that this was common
for children of Z.N.B.'s age in foster
care, which the orphans' court found credible.

J., and NICHOLS, J.
[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <author>KUNSELMAN</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Thaddeus Marcel Muldrow filed a notice
of appeal thirty-three days after he was
sentenced for violating parole. This appeal
is timely only if the day after Thanksgiving
&mdash;the thirtieth day after Muldrow's sentencing
&mdash;is a "day made a legal holiday"
by the laws of Pennsylvania or the United
States. 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1908; <EMBI>see</EMBI> Pa.R.J.A. 107.
We hold that it is not. If the correct filing
office is open on that day, time limits to
file documents in that office are not extended
to the following Monday. Accordingly,
we quash this appeal.

<P20>On October 25, 2023, the trial court
found that Muldrow violated his parole and
sentenced him. Muldrow did not file a
post-sentence motion. He filed a notice of
appeal on November 27, 2023.

<P20>Generally, a criminal defendant must file
a notice of appeal "within 30 days of the
imposition of the judgment of sentence in
open court." Pa.R.A.P. 903(a), (c)(3); <EMBI>see</EMBI>
Pa.R.Crim.P. 708, <EM>comment</EM> (explaining
that an appeal in a violation case "must be
filed within the 30-day appeal period" if
the judge does not grant reconsideration
or vacate the sentence). At the time of
Muldrow's violation sentencing, this time
limit was construed according to Section
1908 of the Statutory Construction Act.
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Fill,</EMBI> 202 A.3d 133, 138
(Pa. Super. 2019); <EMBI>see</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 107 (effective
July 1, 1976-December 31, 2023). That
statute provides:
<Page 258>

<B22>When any period of time is referred to
in any statute, such period in all cases,
except as otherwise provided in section
1909 of this title (relating to publication
for successive weeks) and section 1910 of
this title (relating to computation of
months) shall be so computed as to exclude
the first and include the last day
of such period. Whenever the last day of
any such period shall fall on Saturday or
Sunday, or on any day made a legal
holiday by the laws of this Commonwealth
or of the United States, such day
shall be omitted from the computation.

<P00>1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1908.<fnr1>

<P20>Here, the last day for Muldrow to file
his appeal was thirty days after October
25, 2023, which was Friday, November 24,
2023, the day after Thanksgiving.

<P20>We hold that under Section 1908,
the day after Thanksgiving is not a legal
holiday. To determine whether a day is
"made a legal holiday," we consider the
enactments of the General Assembly and
Congress. <EMBI>Bassett v. Bassett,</EMBI> 543 Pa. 323,
671 A.2d 661, 662 (1995). Neither body has
designated the day after Thanksgiving as a
legal holiday. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 44 P.S. &sect; 11; 5 U.S.C.
&sect; 6103(a). Therefore, Section 1908 does not
omit that day from a time computation.

<P20>Muldrow's arguments to the contrary do
not persuade us that the day after Thanksgiving
is "made a legal holiday" by state or
federal law. He provides official holiday
lists from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
and the Secretary of Administration.
We read these executive- and judicial-branch
declarations only to control the offices
they identify: "administrative offices
of State Government" and "employees of
the appellate courts and the Administrative
Office of Pennsylvania Courts," respectively.
Neither purports to establish
the law of the Commonwealth for purposes
of court filings, and we decline to infer
such a result.

<P20>Muldrow candidly acknowledges that the
Clerk of Courts of Lebanon County was
open for business on Friday, November 24,
2023. He argues, however, that the employees'
choice to work on that day "does
not alter the status of the day as a legal
holiday." <EMBI>Bassett,</EMBI> 671 A.2d at 662. While
we agree that the status of the day after
Thanksgiving does not depend on whether
the filing office was open, we reiterate that
the legislature did not designate that day
as a legal holiday.

<P20>In sum, the day after Thanksgiving
is not "made a legal holiday by the laws of
this Commonwealth or of the United
States." 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1908; <EMBI>see</EMBI> Pa.R.J.A.
107(b). If the day after Thanksgiving is the
time limit to file a notice of appeal, and the
correct filing office for a notice of appeal is
open,<fnr2> then the time to appeal is not extended
to the following Monday. That happened
here. Accordingly, we quash the
appeal as untimely.

<P20>Appeal quashed.
<FN>
<fnt1> The applicable authority is now Pennsylvania
Rule of Judicial Administration 107,
which is substantively identical to Section
1908. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.R.Crim.P. 101(c) (effective January
1, 2024); Pa.R.A.P. 107 (effective January
1, 2024).

<fnt2> Neither Section 1908 nor Rule of Judicial
Administration 107(b) addresses the closure
of a filing office on a non-holiday. However, if
the office is closed, we have held that this
amounts to a breakdown in court operations,
and we have allowed the appeal to be filed the
following business day. <EMBI>See Commonwealth
v. Koeck,</EMBI> 360 Pa.Super. 200, 520 A.2d 53, 55-56
(1987).

[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <author>MURRAY</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Lisa Christine Ansorge (Appellant) appeals
from the order denying her petition
to set aside a sheriff's sale in this mortgage
foreclosure action. After careful review,
we dismiss the appeal as moot.

<P20>The trial court summarized the factual
and procedural background:

<B22>On November 30, 2017, [Appellant] executed
a mortgage to obtain funds to
construct a residential property located
at 1421 Gertrude Avenue, Phoenixville,
<Page 261>
Pennsylvania (hereinafter referred to as
"the property"). On September 22, 2022,
this mortgage was assigned to Plaintiff
Santander Bank, N.A. ([Santander]).

<B42>... [Appellant] stopped making her
required mortgage payments as of April
1, 2022. Since that time, [Appellant] has
not made any mortgage payments.

<B42>On November 11, 2022, [Santander]
filed a Complaint in Mortgage Foreclosure,
alleging that the mortgage was in
default because no payments had been
made after March of 2022. The outstanding
balance on the mortgage was alleged
to be $473,414.43. [Santander] sought to
recover this amount plus interest, fees
and costs. [Appellant] failed to timely
respond to th[e] complaint, and a default
judgment was entered on January 10,
2023. Judgment <EM>in rem</EM> was entered
against [Appellant] in the amount of
$481,072.34. On that date, [Santander]
also filed a Praecipe for Writ of Execution
in Mortgage Foreclosure. On April
26, 2023, the [p]roperty was sold at sheriff's
sale to Bryant Construction [Inc.
(Bryant), an unrelated third party, for
$518,900.00].

<B42>On May 2, 2023, [Appellant] filed an
Emergency Petition to Set Aside the
Sheriff's Sale and to Vacate the Default
Judgment. In this petition, [Appellant]
state[d] that her failure to pay the mortgage
and [her failure to contest] the
entry of default judgment against her
w[ere] due to "adverse events" in her
"personal and work life," [] her reliance
on advice from a person pretending to
be a lawyer with a non-existent law
firm[,] and oppressive, overbearing and
unfair conduct by [Santander]. On May
10, 2023, [the trial court] entered an
order directing the Montgomery County
Sheriff to refrain from delivering a deed
to Bryant ... [,] but not granting any
other relief.

<P00>Trial Court Opinion, 2/29/24, at 1-2 (footnotes
omitted).

<P20>On May 11, 2023, Appellant filed a suggestion
of bankruptcy and notice of removal
to the bankruptcy court. On July 11,
2023, the bankruptcy court granted Santander's
motion for relief from the automatic
bankruptcy stay, and remanded the
matter to the trial court.

<P20>The trial court detailed the subsequent
proceedings:

<B22>On September 8, 2023, [Appellant] filed
a Petition to Set Aside the Sheriff's Sale.
In this petition, [Appellant] provide[d] a
long explanation of the reasons for her
failure over various time periods to
make her mortgage payments, as well as
her reasons for not sending the documents
requested by [Santander] under
the loss mitigation program.<fnr1>
<Page 262>

<B42>On December 20, 2023, following a
hearing, [the trial court] entered an order
denying the Petition to Set Aside
the Sheriff's Sale with prejudice. This
order also confirmed the sheriff's sale,
and vacated the May 10, 2023[,] order
directing the Montgomery County Sheriff
to refrain from delivering to Bryant
... the deed to the property.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 3-4 (some capitalization modified;
footnote added).

<P20>On December 26, 2023, Appellant filed a
timely notice of appeal from the December
20, 2023, order. On the same date, Appellant
filed in the trial court an Emergency
Petition for Supersedeas Pending Appeal,
requesting "a hearing to fix the extent to
which additional security is required" under
Pa.R.A.P. 1733.<fnr2> Appellant argued a
supersedeas was needed "to prevent the
recording of the Sheriff's Deed from the
April 26, 2023[,] Sheriff's Sale, <EM>inter alia,</EM>
so that [Appellant] will have continuing
standing to prosecute the appeal." Emergency
Petition for Supersedeas Pending
Appeal, 12/26/23, &para; 6.

<P20>On December 28, 2023, the trial court
denied the supersedeas petition without a
hearing. On the same date, Appellant filed
an Emergency Petition for Reconsideration.
Appellant argued a supersedeas

<B22>is vitally important here, in order for
[Appellant] to maintain and preserve her
standing to prosecute the appeal.... <EMB>If
the Sheriff's Deed is delivered and recorded
while the appeal is pending,
the appeal is at risk for dismissal due
to mootness.</EMB>

<P00>Emergency Petition for Reconsideration,
12/28/23, &para;&para; 4-5 (emphasis added; paragraph
break and numbering omitted). On
December 29, 2023, the trial court granted
reconsideration of its December 28, 2023,
order.

<P20>On January 12, 2024, the trial court
heard oral argument on Appellant's supersedeas
petition. On February 21, 2024, the
court entered an order denying the petition.
The order also directed the sheriff to
record and deliver the deed to Bryant.
<Page 263>

<P20>Also on February 21, 2024, Appellant
filed in this Court an Emergency Petition
for Supersedeas Pending Appeal. We temporarily
stayed the trial court proceedings,
"including the sheriff's delivery of the
deed," and directed Santander to file a
response to Appellant's petition. Order,
2/23/24. On March 4, 2024, Santander filed
a response. On March 7, 2024, we denied
the supersedeas petition and lifted the
temporary stay.

<P20><EMB>On April 1, 2024, the Montgomery
County Sheriff delivered the deed to
Bryant.</EMB> <EMBI>See</EMBI> Trial Court Docket, Entry
Nos. 62-63. The deed was recorded on
April 26, 2024. <EMBI>See id.,</EMBI> Entry No. 64.

<P20>Appellant and the trial court have complied
with Pa.R.A.P. 1925. Appellant presents
five interrelated issues for our review,
each contending the trial court erred in
determining Santander did not violate
Regulation X. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Appellant's Brief at 17-19.<fnr3>

<P20>However, Santander argues the appeal
should be dismissed as moot because
Appellant failed to obtain a supersedeas,
and the deed has been delivered to the
sheriff's sale buyer, Bryant. Santander
Brief at 9-10. We agree.

<P20>Regarding the doctrine of mootness,
we observe that,

<B22>[a]s a general rule, an actual case or
controversy must exist at all stages of
the judicial process, or a case will be
dismissed as moot. An issue can become
moot during the pendency of an appeal
due to an intervening change in the facts
of the case or due to an intervening
change in the applicable law. In that
case, an opinion of this Court is rendered
advisory in nature. An issue before
a court is moot if in ruling upon the
issue the court cannot enter an order
that has any legal force or effect.

<P00><EMBI>Trust of John S. Middleton,</EMBI> 313 A.3d
1079, 1086 (Pa. Super. 2024) (quoting <EMBI>In re
D.A.,</EMBI> 801 A.2d 614, 616 (Pa. Super. 2002)
(<EM>en banc</EM>) (citations and quotation marks
omitted)). "It is impermissible for courts to
render purely advisory opinions. In other
words, judgments or decrees to which no
effect can be given will not, in most cases,
be entered by this Court." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (citation
omitted).

<P20>Nevertheless, this Court

<B22>will decide questions that otherwise have
been rendered moot when one or more
of the following exceptions to the mootness
doctrine apply: 1) the case involves
a question of great public importance, 2)
the question presented is capable of repetition
and apt to elude appellate review,
or 3) a party to the controversy will
suffer some detriment due to the decision
of the trial court.

<P00><EMBI>Lico, Inc. v. Dougal,</EMBI> 216 A.3d 1129, 1132
(Pa. Super. 2019) (citation omitted).

<P20>Here, Santander relies on <EMBI>Deutsche
Bank v. Butler,</EMBI> 868 A.2d 574 (Pa. Super.
2005). In <EMBI>Deutsche Bank,</EMBI> the trial court
granted a petition to set aside a sheriff's
sale of real estate, and the sheriff's sale
buyer appealed. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 575-76. However,
the buyer failed to post the required supersedeas
bond, and "the court's order
setting aside the sheriff's sale was never
superseded." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 577. During the pendency
of the appeal, a second sheriff's sale
took place. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> A second buyer purchased
the property, and the sheriff delivered the
deed to that buyer. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> We dismissed the
first buyer's appeal as moot, observing
<Page 264>
that because "the property was sold at the
second sale, ... an order declaring the
first sale valid would have no effect." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Appellant appears to concede her appeal
is moot. In her brief, she "acknowledges
that she cannot rely on the prosecution of
this appeal in order to re-obtain ownership
of [the property], because of the loss of
standing for that purpose." Appellant's
Brief at 22 (citing <EMBI>U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n
v. Schraven,</EMBI> 1153 WDA 2015, 2016 WL
5573740 (Pa. Super. 2016) (non-precedential
memorandum) (dismissing as moot
an appeal from an order denying a petition
to set aside a sheriff's sale in a foreclosure
action, where the appellant did not obtain
a supersedeas and the deed had been delivered
to the sheriff's sale buyer); <EMBI>U.S.
Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. O'Meara,</EMBI> 376 EDA

385 EDA 2018, 2018 WL 6839353 (Pa.
Super. 2018) (non-precedential memorandum)
(same)).<fnr4>

<P20>However, Appellant asserts

<B22>that she should have standing for the
right to pursue an independent legal
action against Santander for money
damages due to Santander's violations of
Regulation X (pursuant to the Pennsylvania
Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer
Protection Law, 73 P.S. &sect; 201-1 <EM>et
seq.,</EM> and 12 C.F.R. [&sect;] 1024.41(a), referencing
12 U.S.C. &sect; 2605(f) of [the Real
Estate Settlement Procedures Act]). The
collateral estoppel effect of the adverse
findings by the lower court, however,
could operate to bar such independent
legal action.... Thus, [Appellant] is
prosecuting this appeal in order to prevent
such collateral estoppel effect.

<P00>Appellant's Brief at 22-23; <EMBI>see also id.</EMBI> at
21-22 (Appellant "respectfully requests
that the Superior Court exercise its power
to vacate the adverse findings made by the
lower court in this case, so that [Appellant]
may pursue other independent litigation
against Santander, free from the preclusive
effect of collateral estoppel.").

<P20>Our review confirms the appeal is
moot. As in <EMBI>Deutsche Bank, supra,</EMBI> Appellant
failed to obtain a supersedeas and,
during the pendency of her appeal, the
sheriff delivered the deed to the sheriff's
sale buyer. Upon the delivery of the deed,
Appellant no longer retained any interest
in the subject property. Accordingly, Appellant
is no longer an aggrieved party in
this purely <EM>in rem</EM> proceeding. <EMBI>See Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Long,</EMBI> 934 A.2d 76, 80
(Pa. Super. 2007) (observing that a sheriff's
sale is "consummated by the acknowledgement
and delivery of the deed" to the
buyer, after which the buyer's rights "become
effective"); <EMBI>Insilco Corp. v. Rayburn,</EMBI>
374 Pa.Super. 362, 543 A.2d 120, 126
(1988) (quashing an appeal from the entry
of <EM>in rem</EM> summary judgment in a mortgage
foreclosure action, where the appellants
had previously conveyed their interest
in the subject property by quitclaim
deed; therefore, the appellants were not
"aggrieved" parties and lacked standing to
challenge the <EM>in rem</EM> judgment); <EMBI>In re
Hickson,</EMBI> 573 Pa. 127, 821 A.2d 1238, 1243
(2003) ("In practical terms, we are assured
that there is a legitimate controversy if the
proponent of a legal action has somehow
been `aggrieved' by the matter he seeks to
challenge. A litigant can establish that he
has been `aggrieved' if he can show that he
has a substantial, direct and immediate
interest in the outcome of the litigation in
<Page 265>
order to be deemed to have standing."
(citations omitted)); <EMBI>Rearick v. Elderton
State Bank,</EMBI> 97 A.3d 374, 383 (Pa. Super.
2014) ("An action in mortgage foreclosure
is strictly an <EM>in rem</EM> proceeding, and the
purpose of a judgment in mortgage foreclosure
is solely to effect a judicial sale of
the mortgaged property." (citation omitted)).

<P20>As Appellant acknowledges, in ruling on
the questions presented in this appeal, we
cannot enter an order that would restore
Appellant's interest in the property. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
Appellant's Brief at 22. The appeal is
therefore moot, and any opinion of this
Court would be merely advisory. <EMBI>See
Deutsche Bank,</EMBI> 868 A.2d at 577-78.

<P20>Our review further discloses that
no exception to the mootness doctrine applies
here. Appellant does not explicitly
argue that any mootness exception applies,
though her assertion regarding collateral
estoppel arguably invokes the exception
where "a party to the controversy will
suffer some detriment due to the decision
of the trial court." <EMBI>Lico, Inc.,</EMBI> 216 A.3d at
1132; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> Appellant's Brief at 21-23.
However, Appellant fails to cite any authorities
regarding mootness exceptions,
or any authorities supporting her argument
that an appellant's desire to prevent
collateral estoppel effect can salvage an
otherwise moot appeal. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI>

<P20>Under our appellate rules, "the
argument portion of an appellate brief
must include a pertinent discussion of the
particular point raised along with discussion
and citation of pertinent authorities.
Failure to cite relevant legal authority constitutes
waiver of the claim on appeal."
<EMBI>Foster v. Nuffer,</EMBI> 286 A.3d 279, 284 n.2
(Pa. Super. 2022) (citation, quotation
marks, and brackets omitted); <EMBI>see also</EMBI>
Pa.R.A.P. 2119(a) (requiring discussion
and citation of pertinent authorities);
<EMBI>Trust Under Deed of Wallace F. Ott,</EMBI> 271
A.3d 409, 421 (Pa. Super. 2021) (stating
that "an appellant waives any issue he fails
to develop sufficiently"). Accordingly, to
the extent Appellant attempts to invoke a
mootness exception, we deem the argument
waived. Even if it were not waived,
we would not conclude that Appellant's
desire to prevent collateral estoppel effect
in a hypothetical future lawsuit constitutes
a detriment sufficient to prompt review of
this moot appeal.<fnr5>

<P20>Appeal dismissed as moot.
<FN>
<fnt1> Appellant's petition asserted the sheriff's
sale should be set aside because Santander
violated federal regulations in seeking foreclosure.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Petition to Set Aside Sheriff's Sale,
9/8/23, at 20. We briefly observe:

<B22>Effective January 10, 2014, pursuant to the
federal Dodd-Frank [Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act of 2010], the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau []
adopted new regulations relating to mortgage
servicing. The new regulations, entitled
"Mortgage Servicing Rules under the
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act
(Regulation X)," are codified at 12 C.F.R.
&sect;&sect; 1024.30 <EM>et seq.</EM> "Regulation X prohibits,
among other things, a loan servicer from
foreclosing on a property in certain circumstances
if the borrower has submitted a
completed loan modification, or loss mitigation,
application." <EMBI>Miller v. Bank of New
York Mellon,</EMBI> 228 F.Supp.3d 1287, 1290
(M.D. Fla. 2017) (citation omitted). Regulation
X requires servicers to follow specified
loss mitigation procedures for a mortgage
loan secured by a borrower's principal residence.

<P00><EMBI>Bank of New York Mellon v. Brooks,</EMBI> 169 A.3d
667, 670-71 (Pa. Super. 2017) (some citations
and footnote omitted); <EMBI>see also id.</EMBI> at 671-72
(detailing loss mitigation procedures required
under Regulation X). Here, Appellant alleged
Santander violated Regulation X by, <EM>inter alia,</EM>
filing its foreclosure complaint while Appellant's
loss mitigation application was still
pending; failing to inform Appellant that her
application was denied; failing to set a firm
deadline for Appellant to submit additional
information; and unreasonably refusing to allow
more time for processing Appellant's application.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Petition to Set Aside Sheriff's
Sale, 9/8/23, at 17. On December 19, 2023,
the trial court conducted an extensive hearing
on these allegations. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 12/19/23. In its
Pa.R.A.P. 1925 opinion, the trial court concluded
"[t]he evidence shows that [Santander]
met the requirements of Regulation X."
Trial Court Opinion, 2/29/24, at 6.

<fnt2> Pa.R.A.P. 1733 provides, in relevant part, as
follows:

<B22><EMB>(a) General rule.</EMB> An appeal from an order
which is not subject to Rule 1731 (automatic
supersedeas of orders for the payment of
money) shall, unless otherwise prescribed
in or ordered pursuant to this chapter, operate
as a supersedeas only upon the filing
with the clerk of the court below of appropriate
security as prescribed in this rule.
Either court may, upon its own motion or
application of any party in interest, impose
such terms and conditions as it deems just
and will maintain the res or status quo
pending final judgment or will facilitate the
performance of the order if sustained.

<B22><EMB>(b) Tangible property.</EMB> When the order determines
the disposition of the property in
controversy as in real actions, replevin, and
actions to foreclose mortgages or when
such property is in the custody of the sheriff,
or when the proceeds of such property
or appropriate security for its value is in the
possession, custody or control of the court,
the amount of the additional security shall
be fixed by agreement of the parties, or by
the court, at such sums only as will secure
any damages for the use and detention of
the property, interest, the costs of the matter
and costs on appeal.

<P00>Pa.R.A.P. 1733(a)-(b).

<fnt3> Because we do not reach Appellant's issues,
as discussed <EMBI>infra,</EMBI> we omit their specific language.
The issues challenge the trial court's
December 20, 2023, order denying Appellant's
petition to set aside the sheriff's sale.
Neither the trial court's nor this Court's denial
of Appellant's petitions for supersedeas is
at issue.

<fnt4> Under Pa.R.A.P. 126(b), unpublished non-precedential
memorandum decisions of this
Court filed <EMB>after</EMB> May 1, 2019, may be cited
for their persuasive value. Appellant cited decisions
filed before that date, and we cite
them here only to note Appellant's acknowledgment
that similarly-situated appeals have
been dismissed as moot.

<fnt5> Neither of the other two mootness exceptions
applies here. This case does not involve
a matter of great public importance, and the
questions presented are not apt to elude appellate
review. <EMBI>See Lico, Inc.,</EMBI> 216 A.3d at
1132 Questions regarding a foreclosure
plaintiff's compliance with Regulation X are
readily reviewable, provided that the defendant
asserts a timely defense.

<P20>OPINION BY <author>KING</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Appellant, Andre Johnson, appeals from
the judgment of sentence entered in the
Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas,
following his bench trial convictions for
disorderly conduct, driving without a license,
and duties at a stop sign.<fnr1> We affirm.

<P20>In its opinion, the trial court set forth
the relevant facts of this case as follows:

<B22>[On November 11, 2021,] Officer Wolfe
of the Glassport Borough Police was on
patrol when she conducted a traffic stop
of a vehicle driven by [Appellant after
he failed to stop at a stop sign]. [Appellant]
failed to yield to lights and sirens,
proceeded at a high rate of speed and
brought his vehicle to a stop on the
street outside of a residence. During the
hour-long encounter, [Appellant] became
belligerent, screamed at the officer, approached
her several times, and called
her a "fucking bitch" numerous times all
in the presence of the public. Office[r]
Wolfe testified that [Appellant], "advised
me that he would be seeing my daughter.
Then proceeded to tell me not to
worry because he's a lover, not a fighter."

<B22>A [w]itness to the scene[, Paul Beisler,
who towed Appellant's vehicle,] credibly
testified that [Appellant] was screaming
and said "he wanted to `F' her daughter"
and "he wanted to get her daughter
pregnant so he could cost ... Officer
Wolfe money that Officer Wolfe was
costing him...." Both the Officer and
the Witness testified that [Appellant]
was asked numerous times to stop his
belligerent behavior.

<P00>(Trial Court Opinion, filed 2/8/24, at unnumbered
pp. 4-5) (internal citations omitted).

<P20>Procedurally, on November 12, 2021, the
police filed a criminal complaint charging
Appellant with the above-mentioned
crimes. On September 1, 2022, following a
bench trial, the court convicted Appellant
of all counts. The court sentenced Appellant
that day to six months' probation for
disorderly conduct and imposed no further
penalty for the remaining offenses. On
Monday, September 12, 2022, Appellant
timely filed a post-sentence motion, which
the court denied on January 10, 2023. Appellant
timely filed a notice of appeal on
February 7, 2023. On February 27, 2023,
the court ordered Appellant to file a concise
statement of errors complained of on
<Page 268>
appeal per Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b), and Appellant
timely complied.

<P20>Appellant raises one issue for our review:

<B22>Whether the evidence was sufficient to
convict [Appellant] at Count One&mdash;Disorderly
Conduct where the Commonwealth
failed to prove, beyond a reasonable
doubt, that his statements qualified
as obscene language?

<P00>(Appellant's Brief at 4).

<P20>In reviewing a challenge to the
sufficiency of the evidence, our standard of
review is as follows:

<B22>As a general matter, our standard of
review of sufficiency claims requires that
we evaluate the record in the light most
favorable to the verdict winner giving
the prosecution the benefit of all reasonable
inferences to be drawn from the
evidence. Evidence will be deemed sufficient
to support the verdict when it establishes
each material element of the
crime charged and the commission
thereof by the accused, beyond a reasonable
doubt. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth
need not establish guilt to a
mathematical certainty. Any doubt about
the defendant's guilt is to be resolved by
the fact finder unless the evidence is so
weak and inconclusive that, as a matter
of law, no probability of fact can be
drawn from the combined circumstances.

<B22>The Commonwealth may sustain its burden
by means of wholly circumstantial
evidence. Accordingly, [t]he fact that the
evidence establishing a defendant's participation
in a crime is circumstantial
does not preclude a conviction where the
evidence coupled with the reasonable inferences
drawn therefrom overcomes
the presumption of innocence. Significantly,
we may not substitute our judgment
for that of the fact finder; thus, so
long as the evidence adduced, accepted
in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth,
demonstrates the respective
elements of a defendant's crimes beyond
a reasonable doubt, the Appellant's convictions
will be upheld.

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Sebolka,</EMBI> 205 A.3d 329,
336-37 (Pa. Super. 2019) (quoting <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Franklin,</EMBI> 69 A.3d 719, 722-23
(Pa. Super. 2013)).

<P20>Appellant argues that he did not
use "obscene" language as required to sustain
his conviction for disorderly conduct.
Appellant concedes that he made offensive
statements. Nevertheless, Appellant insists
that his statements did not appeal to
the prurient interest. Appellant acknowledges
that he referenced impregnating Officer
Wolfe's daughter, but he contends
that he did not describe a specific sex act
in a prurient manner. Appellant further
claims that his statements did not qualify
as "depicting or describing, in a patently
offensive way, sexual conduct specifically
defined by the applicable state law." (Appellant's
Brief at 16). Appellant maintains
that his statements "alluding to sex with
the officer's daughter" merely meant to
portray his wish to financially retaliate
against Officer Wolfe. (<EMBI>See id.</EMBI>) Appellant
avers that he did not intend to evoke sexual
arousal or to appeal to a "shameful or
morbid" sexual impulse. (<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 17). Appellant
highlights that he did not even know
Officer Wolfe's daughter and that he did
not describe or name any specific sex act.
Appellant posits that his comments were
"stock insults" and "merely immature and
the product of frustration at the expense
of the tow." (<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 18-19). Appellant concludes
the Commonwealth presented insufficient
evidence to sustain his disorderly
conduct conviction, and this Court must
grant relief. We disagree.

<P20>The Crimes Code defines the offense of
disorderly conduct, in relevant part, as
follows:
<Page 269>

<B22><EMB>&sect; 5503. Disorderly conduct</EMB>

<B22><EMB>(a) Offense defined.</EMB>&mdash;A person is guilty
of disorderly conduct if, with intent to
cause public inconvenience, annoyance
or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk
thereof, he:

<C5>* * *

<B22>(3) uses obscene language, or makes an
obscene gesture[.]

<P00>18 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 5503(a)(3).

<P20>When determining whether language
is "obscene" for purposes of Section
5503(a)(3), we apply the three-part test set
forth in <EMBI>Miller v. California,</EMBI> 413 U.S. 15,
93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973). <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Kelly,</EMBI> 758 A.2d 1284, 1286
(Pa. Super. 2000). This test requires us to
decide: (1) whether the average person,
applying contemporary community standards
would find that the work (or statement),
taken as a whole, appeals to the
prurient interest; (2) whether the work
depicts or describes, in a patently offensive
way, sexual conduct specifically defined by
the applicable state law; and (3) whether
the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
<EMBI>Id. See also Miller, supra</EMBI> at 24, 93
S.Ct. at 2615. A "prurient interest" has "a
tendency to excite lustful thoughts" which
roughly encompasses "a shameful or morbid
interest in nudity, sex, or excretion."
<EMBI>Roth v. United States,</EMBI> 354 U.S. 476, 487
n.20, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1310, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498
(1957).

<P20>"Vulgar language, however distasteful
or offensive to one's sensibilities,
does not become a crime because people
standing nearby stop, look, and listen."
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Weiss,</EMBI> 340 Pa.Super.
427, 490 A.2d 853, 856 (1985). Thus, this
Court has reversed a defendant's conviction
for disorderly conduct under subsection
(a)(3) where the defendant yelled
"fuck the police" or other similar statements
which are offensive or vulgar but
lack a sexual connotation. <EMBI>See, e.g., Commonwealth
v. Pennix,</EMBI> 176 A.3d 340, 341-42
(Pa. Super. 2017) (reversing appellant's
conviction for disorderly conduct where
appellant stated to deputy in courthouse
"Fuck you I ain't got time for this," "Fuck
you police" and "I don't got time for you
fucking police"); <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
McCoy,</EMBI> 69 A.3d 658, 661 (Pa. Super. 2013),
<EM>appeal denied,</EM> 623 Pa. 761, 83 A.3d 414
(2014) (reversing appellant's conviction for
disorderly conduct where appellant shouted
"Fuck the police" multiple times; there
is no evidence that appellant's chant was
intended to appeal to anyone's prurient
interest nor did it describe, in patently
offensive way sexual conduct); <EMBI>Kelly, supra</EMBI>
at 1285 (reversing appellant's conviction
for disorderly conduct where appellant
said "Fuck you, asshole" to borough street
department employee and displayed hand
gesture of extending middle finger; here,
appellant's use of "F-word" and middle
finger were angry words and angry gesture
having nothing to do with sex; rather,
they were meant to express disrespect to,
and to offend, borough employee); <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Muhammad,</EMBI> No. 690 MDA
2022, unpublished memorandum at 2, 2023
WL 156823 (Pa. Super. filed Jan. 11, 2023)<fnr2>
(reversing appellant's conviction for disorderly
conduct where appellant told security
officer "I'm not fucking talking to you"
and said "fuck you" twice to deputy sheriff
and security officer).

<P20>Conversely, this Court has upheld convictions
under Section 5503(a)(3) where the
defendant's remarks have a sexual component.
Recently, in <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Rosenberger,</EMBI>
Nos. 477 EDA 2023, 496 EDA
2023, 2024 WL 3290755 (Pa. Super. filed
<Page 270>
July 3, 2024) (unpublished memorandum),
this Court affirmed the appellant's convictions
for disorderly conduct under Section
5503(a)(3). On appeal, the appellant
claimed that his comments did not constitute
"obscene" language under the statute
and were merely vulgarities that did not
"involve conduct appealing to a prurient
interest or the description of sexual conduct
in a patently offensive way." <EMBI>See id.</EMBI>
at *4. This Court held that the appellant's
reliance on <EMBI>Pennix, McCoy,</EMBI> and <EMBI>Kelly</EMBI> was
misplaced because those cases involved
"angry words ... having nothing to do
with sex." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at *4. In affirming the appellant's
convictions, this Court explained:

<B22>With respect to the first period, on
March 8, 2021, [Victim's] security system
recorded [Appellant] saying,
"[F]uck you, cunt," and making four separate
remarks that [Victim] was "trying
to prosecute a person for jerking off in
front of children." Taken as a whole,
[Appellant's] rant, where he used an offensive
term for female genitalia and a
lewd term for describing masturbation,
particularly when paired with the reference
to children, all directed at a woman
who refused his sexual advances, appealed
to the prurient interest, described
sexual conduct in a patently offensive
way, and had no serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value.

<B22>With respect to the second period, on
October 2, 2021, [Victim's] security system
recorded [Appellant] calling [Victim]
a "beautiful woman," then describing
his conduct with respect to her as
the "equivalent of a dick pic," asking
"how high quality that dick pic was,"
stating that "dick pics usually have a
way of giving the warning and a choice,"
and that he hoped [Victim] and her family
remembered the "dick pic." The
phrase "dick pics" refers to pictures of
male genitalia which are sent to others
for the purpose of inciting sexual
thoughts. Thus, we again conclude [Appellant]
attempted to appeal to a prurient
interest, described his conduct in a
lewd and patently offensive way, and
there was no serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value to his words.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at *5 (internal citations omitted).

<P20>Instantly, in evaluating Appellant's sufficiency
challenge, the trial court reasoned:

<B22>The Officer and the Witness were credible.
The evidence supports the conviction
of Disorderly Conduct &sect; 5503(a)(3).
The encounter took place on a public
street with several individuals observing,
recklessly creating alarm and annoyance.
[Appellant's] conduct and words
were obscene. In addition to being profane,
[Appellant's] words were obscene
because his language appeals to the prurient
interest, and he described in a
patently offensive way, sexual conduct
directed toward the Officer's daughter.
... The evidence established that [Appellant]
persisted in his conduct after
being requested to desist; thus, the conviction
of the offense graded as a misdemeanor
of the third degree was well
supported.

<P00>(Trial Court Opinion at unnumbered p. 6).

<P20>The record supports the court's analysis.
Officer Wolfe testified that Appellant stated
"that he would be seeing my daughter.
Then proceeded to tell me not to worry
because he's a lover, not a fighter." (N.T.
Trial, 9/1/22, at 9). Additionally, Paul Beisler
testified that Appellant said, "he wanted
to F [Officer Wolfe's] daughter and he
wanted to ... get her daughter pregnant
so [he could] ... cost Officer Wolfe money
that Officer Wolfe was costing him by
having his car towed." (<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 25).<fnr3> Mr.
<Page 271>
Beisler interpreted Appellant's remarks as
threatening Officer Wolfe. (<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 28).

<P20>Unlike <EMBI>Pennix, McCoy, Kelly,</EMBI> and
<EMBI>Muhammad,</EMBI> this case does not involve
mere "angry words" having nothing to do
with sex. <EMBI>Compare Pennix, supra</EMBI>;
<EMBI>McCoy, supra</EMBI>; <EMBI>Kelly, supra</EMBI>; <EMBI>Muhammad,
supra.</EMBI> Rather, Appellant's comments
that he is a "lover, not a fighter"
and wanted to have sex with and impregnate

test. <EMBI>See Miller, supra</EMBI>;<fnr4> <EMBI>Kelly, supra.
See also McCoy, supra</EMBI>; <EMBI>Rosenberger, supra.</EMBI>
Thus, Appellant's comments constituted
obscene language under existing
relevant authority. Viewed in the light
most favorable to the Commonwealth as
verdict winner, the evidence was sufficient
to sustain Appellant's conviction for
disorderly conduct. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 18 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 5503(a)(3); <EMBI>Sebolka, supra.</EMBI> Accordingly,
we affirm.

<P20>Judgment of sentence affirmed.

<P20>DISSENTING OPINION BY <author>DUBOW</author>,
<dgn>J.</dgn>:
[DT]
<P20>I respectfully dissent from the Majority's
decision to affirm Appellant's judgment
of sentence because I characterize
Appellant's statements as ones that threaten
sexual violence and, thus, do not have a
tendency "to excite lustful thoughts." Accordingly,
the statements do not meet the
definition of "obscene" as articulated in
<EMBI>Miller v. California,</EMBI> 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct.
2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) and <EMBI>Roth v.
United States,</EMBI> 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304,
1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957). I would, therefore,
conclude that the Commonwealth's evidence
was insufficient to prove the element
of "obscenity" for the offense of Disorderly
Conduct.

<P20>As noted by the Majority, a person is
guilty of Disorderly Conduct "if, with intent
to cause public inconvenience, annoyance[,]
or alarm, or recklessly creating a
risk thereof, <EMB>he [] uses obscene language,</EMB>
or makes an obscene gesture[.]" 18
Pa.C.S. &sect; 5503(a)(3) (emphasis added).
Courts have defined language as "obscene"
when, <EM>inter alia,</EM> it appeals to a person's
prurient interest. <EMBI>Miller,</EMBI> 413 U.S. at 24, 93
S.Ct. 2607. A prurient interest has a "tendency
to excite lustful thoughts" and
roughly encompasses "a shameful or morbid
interest in nudity, sex, or excretion[.]"
<EMBI>Roth,</EMBI> 354 U.S. at 487 n. 20, 77 S.Ct. 1304
(citations omitted).

<P20>In this case, Appellant argues that his
statements did not appeal to the prurient
interest because they did not describe a
specific sex act in a prurient manner or
depict or describe sexual conduct in a patently
offensive way. Appellant's Brief at
15-18. Instead, Appellant claims that he
expressed his statements to retaliate financially
against Officer Wolfe and the statements
were "merely immature and the
product of frustration at the expense of the
tow." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 18. The Majority rejects this
characterization and finds that the statements
were obscene because they were of
a sexual nature. Majority Op. at 270-71. I
agree that Appellant's statements were of
a sexual nature. Where the Majority and I
<Page 272>
part ways, however, is regarding whether
the statements appeal to one's prurient
interests and, thus, meet the definition of
"obscenity."

<P20>According to the trial court, after Officer
Wolfe conducted a traffic stop of a car that
Appellant was driving, Appellant, during
the hour-long encounter, was belligerent,
screamed at the officer, and called her a
"fucking bitch" numerous times. Trial Ct.
Op., 2/8/24, at 4 (unpaginated). Of most
significance to my analysis are Appellant's
statements that he advised Officer Wolfe
"that he'd be seeing [her] daughter" and
then "not to worry because he's a lover,
not a fighter." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Appellant then screamed
at Officer Wolfe that Appellant "wanted to
`F' his daughter" and "he wanted to get
her daughter pregnant so he could cost
... Officer Wolfe money that Officer
Wolfe was costing him."<fnr1> <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 4-5.

<P20>The Majority agrees with the trial
court's characterization of these statements
as "sexual activity directed towards
the police officer's daughter." Majority Op.
at 270 (quoting Trial Ct. Op. at 6). The
Majority, in concluding that these statements
met the definition of "obscenity,"
analogizes these statements to those the
defendant made in <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Rosenberger,</EMBI>
Nos. 477 EDA 2023, 496 EDA
2023, 2024 WL 3290755 (Pa. Super. filed
July 3, 2024) (non-precedential decision).
Majority Op. at 270-71.

<P20>In <EMBI>Rosenberger,</EMBI> the defendant, over a
period of months, made statements to a
woman who refused his sexual advances,
which included referring to her as "cunt"
and ranting about "jerking off in front of
children" and his "dick pic." 2024 WL
3290755, at *5. In concluding that these
statements appealed to the prurient interest
and met the definition of "obscenity"
for purposes of the Disorderly Conduct
conviction, the Superior Court reasoned:

<B22>With respect to the first period, on
March 8, 2021, [Victim's] security system
recorded Rosenberger saying,
"[F]uck you, cunt," and making four separate
remarks that [Victim] was "trying
to prosecute a person for jerking off in
front of children." Taken as a whole,
Rosenberger's rant, where he used an
offensive term for female genitalia and a
lewd term for describing masturbation,
particularly when paired with the reference
to children, all directed at a woman
who refused his sexual advances, appealed
to the prurient interest, described
sexual conduct in a patently offensive
way, and had no serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value.

<B22>With respect to the second period, on
October 2, 2021, [Victim's] security system
recorded Rosenberger calling [Victim]
a "beautiful woman," then describing
his conduct with respect to her as
the "equivalent of a dick pic," asking
"how high quality that dick pic was,"
stating that "dick pics usually have a
way of giving the warning and a choice,"
and that he hoped [Victim] and her family
remembered the "dick pic." The
phrase "dick pics" refers to pictures of
male genitalia which are sent to others
for the purpose of inciting sexual
thoughts. Thus, we again conclude Rosenberger
attempted to appeal to a prurient
interest, described his conduct in a
lewd and patently offensive way, and
there was no serious literary, artistic,
political, or scientific value to his words.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (internal citations omitted).

<P20>The Majority in this case concludes that
Appellant's statements appeal to the prurient
<Page 273>
interest because Appellant's comments
include his statement that he is a
"lover, not a fighter" and wanted to have
sex with and impregnate the officer's
daughter. Majority Op. at 270-71.

<P20>Although this is a close call, I characterize
Appellant's statements differently and
focus on their coercive aspects. The defendant's
sexually oriented statements in <EMBI>Rosenberger</EMBI>
did not involve a threat to rape
the victim, but rather name calling and
highlighting the manner in which the victim
sexually aroused the defendant, which
could have a "tendency to excite lustful
thoughts." In contrast, a threat to engage
in sexual violence does not and should not
have a "tendency to excite lustful
thoughts" and, thus, does not meet the
definition of "obscenity."

<P20>My characterization of the statement as
depicting sexual violence is not lessened by
Appellant's statement that he "is a lover,
not a fighter." He still expressed a desire
to force Officer Wolfe's daughter to engage
in sexual intercourse so that he could
impregnate her.

<P20>While Appellant's statements are vulgar,
troubling, and personally offensive, I cannot
conclude that this threat of sexual
violence does or should "appeal to one's
prurient interest" and, thus, meets the definition
of "obscenity." I emphasize that I
do not condone Appellant's conduct; rather,
I believe that Appellant's threatening
statements meet the statutory requirements
for a different crime, Terroristic
Threats, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2706(a)(1).

<P20>For these reasons, I would be constrained
to reverse Appellant's conviction
for Disorderly Conduct.
<FN>
<fnt1> 18 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 5503(a)(3); 75 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect;&sect; 1501(a); and 3323(b), respectively.

<fnt2> <EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 126(b) (stating this Court may
rely on unpublished decisions of this Court
filed after May 1, 2019 for their persuasive
value).

<fnt3> In the affidavit of probable cause, Officer
Wolfe relayed that Mr. Beisler had stated that
Appellant said "I'm going to put my black
dick in her daughter. Hopefully she gets pregnant."
(Affidavit of Probable Cause, 11/12/21,
at 2). Thus, it appears that Mr. Beisler may
have paraphrased Appellant's statement at trial.

<fnt4> There is no dispute that Appellant's comments
also satisfy the third prong of the <EMBI>Miller</EMBI>
test because they lack "serious literary,
artistic, political, or scientific value." <EMBI>See id.</EMBI>
at 24, 93 S.Ct. at 2615.

<fnt1> As the Majority noted, the witness, Mr. Beisler,
may have paraphrased Appellant's statement
at trial because the Affidavit of Probable
Cause stated that Appellant said "I'm going to
put my black dick in her daughter. Hopefully
she gets pregnant." Although this statement is
more vulgar than the statement Mr. Beisler
testified to, it does not change my analysis.

[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <author>COLINS</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Appellant, Robert Anderson, appeals
from the order denying his petition filed
pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act,
42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9541 <EM>et seq.</EM> ("PCRA"), collaterally
challenging his jury conviction of
murder in the third degree.<fnr1> Appellant
raises multiple claims of prior counsel's
ineffective assistance based on 15 separate
comments in the prosecutor's summation
and a discretionary trial court ruling. All
of the claims are resolvable on the trial
court record. We affirm.

<P20>On direct appeal, this Court found the
trial court's statement of facts to have
been supported by the record, reproduced
as follows:

<B22>On July 13, 2013, Daimeen Walker and
Josiah McClarence were involved in an
altercation with Giovanni Bain and
Nkingi Jones in southwest Philadelphia.
Following the incident, Mr. Walker
called Tyreek Hall, also known as
"Southwest Reek," for help. Driving a
gold Buick, Mr. Hall and Appellant
picked up Mr. Walker and Mr. McClarence
and asked them to identify the
men with whom they had brawled. After
Mr. Walker and Mr. McClarence did so,
Appellant and Mr. Hall switched cars,
getting into a rented silver Ford Mustang.

<B22>At approximately 4:00 p.m., Appellant
and Mr. Hall drove to North 64th
Street, where Mr. Jones and Mr. Bain
were playing basketball with brothers
Aaron and Tremaine Rogers. Mr. Hall
asked if any of the men had been bothering
his cousin. Mr. Jones informed
him that the fight was over. At that
time, Appellant told Mr. Hall to "get
busy" with the young men. Mr. Hall
took a gun from his waistband and fired
seven times into the crowd before fleeing
with Appellant.

<B22>Police responded to the scene and were
provided with a description of the perpetrators.
As they began to search for
evidence, officers discovered Tremaine
Rogers lying face down in the back yard
of 905 N. 64th Street. Mr. Rogers had
suffered a gunshot wound to the lower
back and was pronounced dead at the
scene.

<B22>Police interviewed Mr. Bain, Mr. Jones,
and Aaron Rogers, who described both
the fistfight and shooting. Police also
interviewed Mr. McClarence and Mr.
Walker, who identified Mr. Hall as
"Southwest Reek" and Appellant as
"Bobby." From two photo arrays, Mr.
Bain, Mr. Jones, and Mr. Rogers identified
Appellant as the driver and Mr.
Hall as the shooter. Further investigation
revealed that on June 26, 2013, Appellant
rented a gray Ford Mustang.
Although the car was due to be returned
July 27, 2013, Appellant exchanged the
car on July 13, 2013 at 5:32 p.m., approximately
one half hour after Mr. Rogers
was pronounced dead.

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Anderson,</EMBI> No. 2117
EDA 2015, 2017 WL 2558644, *1 (Pa. Super.,
filed June 13, 2017) (the "<EMBI>Direct Appeal</EMBI>")
(footnote omitted). In addition,
when the shooting started, Justin Mond
was standing in front of the house and fled
up the street. N.T. 3/9/15, 193-197. A projectile
was found two months later in the
front door of a house in line with where a
gunshot fired by co-defendant at Mond
might have gone. N.T. 3/6/15, 40-44, 188-190.
<Page 280>

<P20>Appellant and co-defendant Hall were
jointly tried by a jury before the Honorable
Sandy L.V. Byrd starting March 3,
2015. At trial, co-defendant Hall testified
he was acting in self-defense and claimed
Aaron Rogers had a gun on the night of
the murder. N.T. 3/9/15, 9-131. Appellant
did not testify.

<P20>On March 12, 2015, the jury returned its
verdict finding Appellant guilty of murder
in the third degree.<fnr2> N.T. 3/12/15, 50. On
June 26, 2015, the court imposed a term of
20 to 40 years' incarceration.

<P20>Appellant filed a timely appeal and
raised three claims: the insufficiency of the
evidence; trial court error in denying a
mistrial for the prosecutor's reference to
Appellant's post-arrest silence and characterization
of defense arguments in summation;
and trial court error in engaging in a
shouting match with and admonishment of
trial counsel. This Court affirmed the judgment
of sentence on June 13, 2017. The
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania denied a
petition for allowance of appeal on November
22, 2017. <EMBI>See Commonwealth v.
Anderson,</EMBI> 174 A.3d 1024 (Table).

<P20>Appellant filed a timely <EM>pro se</EM> PCRA
petition on September 5, 2018. Retained
PCRA counsel filed an amended petition.
The Commonwealth filed a Motion to Dismiss,
to which Appellant filed a response.

<P20>The Honorable Scott DiClaudio, presiding
as the PCRA court, issued a Notice of
Intent to Dismiss the Petition in accordance
with Pa.R.Crim.P. 907 on January 5,
2023, stating the reasons it found each of
the claims meritless. Notice of Intent to
Dismiss, 2-3; Trial Court Record, 389-390.
The PCRA court dismissed the petition on
February 24, 2023. Order, 2/24/2023; Trial
Court Record, 403. Appellant filed a timely
Notice of Appeal, and Concise Statement
of Errors Complained of on Appeal pursuant
to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). Trial Court Record,
404, 422-424.

<P20>Appellant raises four claims on appeal,
as follows:

<B24>I. Did trial and direct appeal counsel
render ineffective assistance for
failure to object to and argue all
available instances in support of
his Petitioner's claim of prosecutorial
misconduct? ...

<B24>II. Was direct appeal counsel ineffective
for failing to quote and discuss
the prosecution's improper
references to petitioner's post-arrest
silence? ...

<B24>III. Did the court below err in failing
to consider cumulative prejudice
when evaluating the above issues,
since there are more than one issue
meeting the first prong of the
ineffectiveness analysis? ...

<B24>IV. Was direct appeal counsel ineffective
for failing to raise on appeal
the trial court's refusal to have the
testimony of co-defendant Hall
read back to the jury?

<P00>Appellant's Brief, 3.

<P20>We review an order denying a
PCRA petition to determine whether the
PCRA court's decision is supported by the
evidence of record and free of legal error.
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Brown,</EMBI> 649 Pa. 293,
196 A.3d 130, 150 (2018); <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Jarosz,</EMBI> 152 A.3d 344, 350 (Pa. Super.
2016). The PCRA court need not hold an
evidentiary hearing if it "can determine
from the record that no genuine issues of
<Page 281>
material fact exist." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
McCready,</EMBI> 295 A.3d 292, 298 (Pa. Super.
2023) (citation omitted). We review the
PCRA court's legal conclusions <EM>de novo.</EM>
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Spotz,</EMBI> 610 Pa. 17, 18
A.3d 244, 259 (2011).

<P20>To obtain relief on a claim of
prior counsel's ineffective assistance, a
PCRA petitioner must satisfy the performance
and prejudice test set forth in <EMBI>Strickland
v. Washington,</EMBI> 466 U.S. 668, 687,
104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). "In
Pennsylvania, we have applied the <EMBI>Strickland</EMBI>
test by looking to three elements: the
petitioner must establish that: (1) the underlying
claim has arguable merit; (2) no
reasonable basis existed for counsel's actions
or failure to act; and (3) the petitioner
suffered prejudice as a result of counsel's
error, with prejudice measured by
whether there is a reasonable probability
that the result of the proceeding would
have been different." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Robinson,</EMBI> 623 Pa. 345, 82 A.3d 998, 1005
(2013) (citing <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Pierce,</EMBI>
515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973, 975 (1987)). The
Sixth Amendment right to counsel is recognized
"not for its own sake, but because
of the effect it has on the accused's right to
a fair trial." <EMBI>Robinson,</EMBI> 82 A.3d at 1005
(internal quotation marks omitted).

<B22>With regard to the second prong (reasonable
basis), "we do not question
whether there were other more logical
courses of action which counsel could
have pursued; rather, we must examine
whether counsel's decisions had any reasonable
basis." <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Hanible,</EMBI>
612 Pa. 183, 30 A.3d 426, 439
(2011). We will hold that counsel's strategy
lacked a reasonable basis only if the
petitioner proves that a foregone alternative
"offered a potential for success
substantially greater than the course actually
pursued." <EMBI>Spotz,</EMBI> 18 A.3d at 260.
Our review of counsel's performance
"must be highly deferential." <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Tharp,</EMBI> 627 Pa. 673, 101 A.3d
736, 772 (2014) (quoting <EMBI>Strickland v.
Washington,</EMBI> 466 U.S. 668, 689, 104
S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). To
establish the third element (prejudice),
the petitioner must show that there is a
reasonable probability that the outcome
of the proceedings would have been different
but for counsel's action or inaction.
[<EMBI>Hanible,</EMBI> 30 A.3d at 439].

<P00><EMBI>Brown,</EMBI> 196 A.3d at 150-51 (internal citations
edited for clarity). A failure to satisfy
any of the three prongs is fatal to a claim
of counsel's ineffective assistance. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
151; <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Midgley,</EMBI> 289 A.3d
1111, 1119 (Pa. Super. 2023).

<P20>Appellant's initial set of claims, which he
combines as though one, are based on the
prosecutor's summation. It alleges both
trial and appellate counsel's ineffective assistance
in raising only some of the numerous
allegedly objectionable instances,
rather than all. Appellant's Brief, 23-26.
Appellant bases this allegation of ineffective
assistance on ten specific comments
made by the prosecutor, separated into
two categories. While some comments
were within the objections made at trial,
the majority were not and so appellate
counsel could not be faulted for not having
raised them in the direct appeal. <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Holmes,</EMBI> 621 Pa. 595, 79
A.3d 562, 563 (2013) ("we hold that
<EMBI>Grant's</EMBI> general rule of deferral to PCRA
review remains the pertinent law on the
appropriate timing for review of claims of
ineffective assistance of counsel").<fnr3>
<Page 282>

<P20>A prosecutor enjoys substantial
latitude to present argument with "logical
force and vigor." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Bryant,</EMBI> 67 A. 3d 726, 728 (Pa. 2013) (citation
omitted); <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Marshall,</EMBI>
633 A.2d 1100, 1107 (Pa. 1993) (citations
omitted). "While it is improper for a
prosecutor to offer any personal opinion as
to guilt of the defendant or credibility of
the witnesses, it is entirely proper for the
prosecutor to summarize the evidence presented,
to offer reasonable deductions and
inferences from the evidence, and to argue
that the evidence establishes the defendant's
guilt." <EMBI>Bryant,</EMBI> 67 A.3d at 727-728.
A prosecutor does not commit misconduct
merely by summarizing the evidence "with
the oratorical flair allowed during argument,"
<EMBI>Marshall,</EMBI> 633 A.2d at 1107, or by
fairly commenting on the evidence and responding
to defense arguments. <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Wayne,</EMBI> 553 Pa. 614, 720 A.2d
456, 468 (1998). The bounds of "oratorical
flair" afford the prosecution significant leeway
in this regard, but "when statements
deteriorate into impermissible characterizations
and inflammatory name-calling
that are divorced from the record or irrelevant
to the elements of the crime at issue,
they are substantially unwarranted and
must be scrutinized for prejudicial effect[.]"
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Clancy,</EMBI> 648 Pa.
179, 192 A.3d 44, 65 (2018); <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Crumbley,</EMBI> 270 A.3d 1171, 1182
(Pa. Super.), <EMBI>appeal denied,</EMBI> 284 A.3d 884
(Pa. 2022). Reversible error occurs only if
the prosecutor has deliberately attempted
to destroy the factfinder's objectivity.
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Miles,</EMBI> 545 Pa. 500, 681
A.2d 1295, 1300 (1996).

<P20>An ineffectiveness claim based
on counsel's failure to object to a prosecutor's
closing argument has merit where it
is demonstrated that the comment deprived
the petitioner of a constitutional or
statutory right, such as the right to a fair
trial or due process. <EMBI>See Commonwealth
v. Tedford,</EMBI> 598 Pa. 639, 960 A.2d 1, 28-29
(2008). "The touchstone is the fairness of
the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 28. The PCRA court ruled that
it "is apparent that none of [the comments
raised in the petition] were so egregious
that the unavoidable effect would be that
the jury was unable to properly weigh the
evidence and render a true verdict." PCRA
Court Opinion, 5. We agree.

<P20>In the direct appeal, Appellant
raised a claim of trial court error in denying
a motion for mistrial based on multiple
specific comments in the prosecutor's closing
argument. We recognize that an allegation
of ineffectiveness based on a failure to
object to the prosecutor's closing argument
is a different legal claim than one of
trial court error in denying a mistrial
based on the same argument. <EMBI>See Commonwealth
v. Collins,</EMBI> 585 Pa. 45, 888
A.2d 564, 573 (2005) ("a Sixth Amendment
claim of ineffectiveness raises a distinct
legal ground for purposes of state PCRA
review under &sect; 9544(a)(2)"). Nonetheless,
"the [ineffectiveness] claim may fail on the
arguable merit or prejudice prong for the
reasons discussed on direct appeal." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
Appellant's failure to delineate his PCRA
claim from that raised on direct appeal,
however, obfuscates the effect of that ruling
on the claims raised in the petition.
Also, Appellant's legal theory that raising
more allegations of improper argument by
<Page 283>
the prosecutor would have resulted in relief
in the direct appeal, Appellant's Brief,
27, rests on the whether any of the additional
claims have merit because this Court
found no merit to those raised in the direct
appeal. <EMBI>Direct Appeal,</EMBI> *4-*5.<fnr4>

<P20>Appellant listed five comments by the
prosecutor that he alleges disparaged defense
counsel, as follows:

<B22>These are some great attorneys. They
can do a lot to wipe things away....

<B22>And these wonderful attorneys can get
up here and try and pull the wool over
your eyes and tell you that is not why he
fired. ...

<B22>It along with several of the other things
that were said by defense attorneys in
their closing is blatantly and provably
not true....

<B22>There are a lot of things that great
defense attorneys can do. They can
shade a lot of things. They can gild
things the way they want them gilded.

<B22>...

<B22>Ladies and gentlemen, in this case these
two individuals, these two attorneys, got
up and did a great job of trying to make
you think Aaron Rogers had a gun ...
He admitted to murder and no amount
of fancy lawyering or clever attorneys
can make that go away. They have tried
to pull the wool over your eyes.

<P00>Appellant's Brief, 26.

<P20>"[I]n order to evaluate whether
the comments were improper, we do not
look at the comments in a vacuum; rather
we must look at them in the context in
which they were made." <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Weiss,</EMBI> 565 Pa. 504, 776 A.2d 958, 968
(2001); <EMBI>Crumbley,</EMBI> 270 A.3d at 1182. Of the
five comments Appellant lists, each was
proper in context as they were grounded
in the facts of the case or fair response to
the arguments made by defense counsel.
<EMBI>See Clancy,</EMBI> 192 A.3d at 65 ("we should not
preclude or condemn a prosecutor's characterizations
of the defendant that are
both based upon the record and that inherently
inform elements of an offense at
issue, especially where the remarks constitute
a fair response to defense counsel's
argument"). <EMBI>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.
Henry,</EMBI> 550 Pa. 346, 706 A.2d 313, 330-31
(1997) (references to defense as "ridiculous"
did not constitute misconduct); <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Davis,</EMBI> 388 Pa.Super. 224,
565 A.2d 458, 466 (1989) (no misconduct
where prosecutor's argument, though "arguably
sarcastic," was based on evidence);
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Maxwell,</EMBI> 505 Pa. 152,
477 A.2d 1309, 1316-17 (1984) (prosecutor's
summation permissibly characterized defense
counsel as "blowing smoke").

<P20>The reference to "great attorneys,"
who can "do a lot to wipe things
away," N.T. 3/10/15, 131, directly responded
to the meager attempt by defense counsel
to undermine Daimeen Walker's in-court
testimony in which he confirmed that
his statement to police reported accurately
what happened the day of the shooting.
N.T. 3/3/15, 253-254. The prosecutor explained
that the only argument presented
that the statement was not accurate was
that Walker had been waiting at homicide
for a "long time" before speaking with
detectives. Of course, that alleged delay
did not undermine Walker's credibility in
court. N.T. 3/10/15, 130-131.

<P20>The reference to "wonderful attorneys"
who tried to "pull the wool over your
eyes and tell you that is not why [co-defendant]
<Page 284>
fired," N.T. 3/10/15, 155, directly
responded to the defense argument that
Aaron Rogers supposedly had a gun and
pulled it first. The prosecutor's comment
rested on the testimony of both Gianni
Bain and Nkangi Jones that Aaron Rogers
did not have a gun that day. N.T. 3/3/15,
304; N.T. 3/4/15, 101. This was proper argument.
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Guilford,</EMBI> 861
A.2d 365, 371-72 (Pa. Super. 2004) (not
improper for prosecutor to argue defense
counsel "tried to pull the wool over your
eyes" where based on the record or "context
of defense counsel's conduct").

<P20>The prosecutor's argument that
"things that were said by defense attorneys
in the closing is blatantly and provably
wrong", N.T. 3/10/15, 161, was directly
preceded by his argument based on
testimony at trial that the four surviving
victims of the shooting "all cooperated immediately
with whichever officer walked
up to them." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> The defense had elicited
at trial that police reports indicated that
the witnesses were not initially cooperative.
N.T. 3/6/15, 205-206. In direct response,
the Commonwealth called Officer
Dionne Madison to explain that her report
that some persons at the scene were not
cooperative, used by defense attorneys in
cross-examination, referred to the people
who had been inside the house at the time
of the shooting and not the three teenagers
outside. <EMBI>Id.,</EMBI> 211-212. The prosecutor's
argument was based directly on trial testimony
and therefore proper.

<P20>The reference to "great attorneys
can ... shade a lot of things ... can
gild things" referred to defense arguments
against the credibility of teenagers Gianni
Bain and Nkingi Jones. N.T. 3/10/15, 167-169.
The prosecutor continued, "[b]ut you
can't change these kids [Jones and Bain]
into something other than what they are,"
which were teenagers who choke up and
start to cry when identifying Appellant
and co-defendant in a photo array, and
"testified consistently, gave statements
consistently." N.T. 3/10/15, 169. "[A] prosecutor
may respond to challenges to his
witnesses' credibility." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Drummond,</EMBI> 775 A.2d 849, 858 (Pa. Super.
2001) (<EM>en banc</EM>).

<P20>With respect to the final passage
of alleged disparagement, Appellant's selectively-edited
quotation isolates the complained
of comment from its context. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
Appellant's Brief, 26. That context refutes
that the prosecutor meant to disparage
counsel. The prosecutor's argument was
based entirely on the record evidence of
the key factual dispute, whether Aaron
Rogers had a gun. At trial, two witnesses
who survived the shooting, Nkingi Jones
and Gianni Bain, testified that co-defendant
Hall opened fire on the order of
Appellant and that Aaron Rogers did not
have a gun. N.T. 3/3/15, 304, 313-320, 327-328;
N.T. 3/4/15, 87-102. Co-defendant testified
that he opened fire in response to
Aaron Rogers pulling a gun. N.T. 3/9/15,
31-40, 86-94. The emphasized language in
the quotation below is the portion quoted
by Appellant in his brief:

<B22><EM>Ladies and gentlemen, in this case these
two individuals, these two attorneys, got
up and did a great job of trying to make
you think Aaron Rogers had a gun.</EM> But
if you look at the evidence in this case,
you know without any question beyond a
reasonable doubt that is not why this
man [co-defendant] fired. They came
with the illegal gun. They came with the
car they could ditch. They prepared to
shoot it out. They said it themselves.
They were ready to shoot. They came
ready to cover up what they did. And
Southwest Reek said and he admitted to
murder. He said the reason he shot was
because these kids talked too reckless.
<EM>He admitted to murder and no amount
of fancy lawyering or clever attorneys</EM>
<Page 285>
<EM>can make that go away. They have tried
to pull the wool over your eyes,</EM> ladies
and gentlemen. I ask you very simply,
don't let that happen. Don't let a gun be
invented out of thin air.

<P00>N.T. 3/10/15, 193. The prosecutor's argument
was plainly based on the record evidence
in fair response to defense arguments.
<EMBI>Clancy,</EMBI> 192 A.3d at 65. <EMBI>See also
Guilford,</EMBI> 861 A.2d at 371-72.

<P20>Appellant also alleged five separate
instances in which the prosecutor
allegedly argued facts not in evidence.
Appellant's Brief, 23-25. These were rhetorical
flourishes. We do not find that
the prosecutor's intent was to mislead
the jury. <EMBI>See Miles,</EMBI> 681 A.2d at 1300.
Moreover, as the PCRA court noted "the
jury was instructed that the statements
during closing were not evidence and instead
facts presented by witnesses was
controlling." PCRA Court Opinion, 5. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
N.T. 3/10/15, 222-223. "The jury is presumed
to follow the court's instructions."
<EMBI>Tedford,</EMBI> 960 A.2d at 37.

<P20>Four of the comments listed by Appellant
as not having been based on evidence
in the record were:

<B22>Josiah did what so many witnesses do in
homicides, right? He got up here and he
said I don't think I said that, that's not
what I said to Homicide....

<B22>The detective work in this case was
called into question, and it always will
be. Every defense attorney in a homicide
will get up and say the assigned
detective did a bad job, he should have
done something different....

<B22>Anybody in the police academy can tell
you getting up over a seven foot wall is
as easy as putting your hands on it....

<B22>You know why we wait, besides the
backlog and all of that? Because we
would have loved to have that gun.

<P00>Appellant's Brief, 23-25.

<P20>Josiah McClarence denied his
written and signed statement to the police
at trial. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T. 3/3/15, 84-128. Thus,
the prosecutor's extrapolation that "so
many witnesses do [the same] in homicides"
was of no particular moment in
this case even if there was no evidence
that such is commonplace. N.T. 3/10/15,
187. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Appellant's Brief, 23. The broader,
more important and wholly accurate
point the prosecutor made was that the
written statement was "substantive evidence."
N.T. 3/10/15, 187.

<P20>Similarly supported by the record
generally was the prosecutor's reference to
"[a]nybody in the police academy." N.T.
3/10/15, 144. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Appellant's Brief, 24-25.
The key point here was that Gianni Bain
testified that he had "hop[ped]" the stone
wall in the backyard of the victim's home
to escape from the shooting. N.T. 3/3/15,
320-321. Defense counsel expressed disbelief
that such was possible on cross-examination
and argument. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T. 3/4/15, 336;
N.T. 3/10/15, 108. The prosecutor directly
responded, "I don't know, by the way,
what people are talking about that Gianni,
a six-foot kid, can't get up over a seven-foot
wall, six-foot athletic kid. Of course he
can. Anybody in the police academy can
tell you getting up over a seven-foot wall is
as easy as putting your hands on it and
getting over it. And Gianni at the time was
a nineteen-year-old teenager, right? Of
course he can get over that wall." The
reference to the police academy was immaterial
to the prosecutor's argument, based
on trial evidence and common experience,
that Gianni Bain's testimony was credible.
<EMBI>Clancy,</EMBI> 192 A.3d at 65; <EMBI>Drummond,</EMBI> 775
A.2d at 858.

<P20>The reference to "[e]very defense
attorney in a homicide" by the prosecutor
may have been unsupported rhetoric in
isolation. N.T. 3/10/15, 151. <EMBI>See also</EMBI> Appellant's
<Page 286>
Brief, 24. However, in this case, the
defense did argue, as the prosecutor said,
that "the assigned detective did a bad job,
he should have done something different."
N.T. 3/10/15, 151. <EMBI>See id.,</EMBI> 75-79, 81-82, 84-87.
Thus, the prosecutor was responding
directly to defense closing argument and
relying on evidence in the record. <EMBI>Clancy,</EMBI>
192 A.3d at 65.

<P20>On this same line, the prosecutor
addressed several specific points the defense
had raised. N.T. 3/10/15, 150-152.
One of which was the delay in examining
the ballistics evidence resulting in a report
being completed and turned over to the
defense shortly before trial. <EMBI>See id.,</EMBI> 151-152;
N.T. 3/3/15, 56-57. The defense attacked
the delay. N.T. 3/10/15, 84. The
prosecutor first referred to the officer's
testimony that he was a witness in three
trials that day to explain the backlog. <EMBI>Id.,</EMBI>
151. He then argued that ballistics experts
would not want to conduct the examination
too soon because additional evidence might
be discovered. <EMBI>Id.,</EMBI> 152. For example, in
this case, a projectile was found, across the
street, two months after the shooting. It
was consistent with the caliber of ammunition
used by co-defendant and located in a
direction in which co-defendant would have
fired a shot at the fleeing Justin Mond.
The prosecutor suggested that the examiners
would have also been waiting for a
firearm used by co-defendant. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Although
there was no testimony to directly
support this, it was a reasonable extrapolation
from the ballistics expert's testimony
that without the firearm used in the shooting,
it was not possible to rule in or out the
possibility of a second gun having been
fired at the scene. N.T. 3/6/15, 30-31.

<P20>The fifth allegation of an argument
based on facts not in evidence referred
to the prosecutor discussing his own
decision not to carry a firearm though
often in a place where he might come face-to-face
with a person accused of a violent
crime, as follows:

<B22>Well, here's the thing about that. I don't
have a gun. I'm a homicide prosecutor.
Every day I go meet with people. I go to
scenes. I go talk to people where I'm in
danger. And before I was a homicide
prosecutor I spent five years as a domestic
violence prosecutor and I never
had a gun then either. The reason I
don't have a gun is because my wife is
against guns. She hates them. She won't
let me have one.

<B22>When you're a domestic violence prosecutor,
there's an incredibly high percentage
chance that when you go to the
scene, to the victim's house, to the survivor's
house, and you go talk to them
that you're going to meet the defendant
there. But I love my job and I love my
wife, so I don't carry a gun.

<B22>The reason no one ever saw any of these
kids with a gun is because they didn't
have a gun. And they may be able to
convince you that I have a gun too, but
the God's honest truth is this weekend
I'll be somewhere I shouldn't be without
a gun because I don't carry a gun, the
same way that Gianni and Aaron and
Tremaine and Nkingi went over that
house without a gun because they didn't
have a gun, and that's why no one has
ever seen any of them with a gun.

<P00>Appellant's Brief, 23-24. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T. 3/10/15,
175-177.

<P20>Although the personal possession of a
firearm by the prosecutor was not a fact in
evidence, the argument presented did not
ask the jury to base its verdict on his
personal decision. It was offered as an
illustration to rebut a defense argument
that Aaron Rogers <EM>must have had a gun</EM>
on him when he returned to the scene of
the initial fight with Gianni Bain and Nkingi
<Page 287>
Jones. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T. 3/10/24, 26-27, 99-101.<fnr5>
Rather than asking the jury to decide the
case on a fact not in evidence, the prosecutor
was illustrating that it was not necessarily
true, as the defense had argued, that
either Aaron Rogers or Gianni Bain must
have possessed a firearm when they returned
to the scene of the initial fight. "It's
one thing to think that somebody may
possibly be getting a gun. It's a whole
`nother thing to say, oh, that's crazy, ...
they would never have gone back over
there without a gun." N.T. 3/10/15, 176.
This was vigorous argument by the prosecutor
based on legitimate inferences from
the trial testimony and therefore proper.
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Luster,</EMBI> ___ Pa. ___,
71 A.3d 1029, 1048 (2013) (<EM>en banc</EM>).

<P20>Appellant's second enumerated
claim in this appeal also is based on five
distinct comments in the prosecutor's summation.
He argues that appellate counsel
provided ineffective assistance "when arguing
that improper reference had been
made to [Appellant's] post-arrest silence,
leading this Court to hold that the issue
could not be decided." Appellant's Brief,
29. This is only half correct. This court
found waiver because counsel had not provided
citations to the record, <EMBI>Direct Appeal,</EMBI>
*4, but it also ruled that "[e]ven if we
did not find waiver, an examination of the
portions of argument cited to by Appellant
do not reveal any inference by the prosecutor
regarding Appellant's post-arrest silen[ce]
but, instead, [he] discuss[ed] Mr.
Hall's testimony regarding his claim of
self-defense." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> In other words, this
Court addressed the merits of the claim.
Therefore, the predicate of the ineffectiveness
allegation against appellate counsel &mdash;
that the claim was not reviewed &mdash; is not
correct.

<P20>Generally, the Commonwealth
may not comment on, or otherwise refer
to, an accused's post-arrest silence in a
subsequent criminal proceeding. <EMBI>E.g.,
Doyle v. Ohio,</EMBI> 426 U.S. 610, 611, 96 S.Ct.
2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976); <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Clark,</EMBI> 533 Pa. 579, 626 A.2d
154, 156 (1993). "[E]ven an explicit reference
to silence is not reversible error
where it occurs in a context not likely to
suggest to the jury that silence is the
equivalent of a tacit admission of guilt,"
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Adams,</EMBI> 628 Pa. 600,
104 A.3d 511, 517 (2014) (quoting <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Whitney,</EMBI> 550 Pa. 618, 708
A.2d 471, 478 (1998)), or if it is harmless
beyond a reasonable doubt. <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Mitchell,</EMBI> 576 Pa. 258, 839 A.2d
202, 212-13 (2003); <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Boone,</EMBI> 862 A.2d 639, 646 (Pa. Super.
2004).

<P20>After our own review, we agree
with this Court's prior ruling on the merits
and conclude that appellate counsel could
not have presented the claim more effectively
on direct appeal such that Appellant
would have been entitled to relief. None of
the comments cited by Appellant refer directly
to him. Rather, each, either directly
by name or in context, referred to co-defendant's
testimony. Accordingly, the
prosecutor was not commenting on Appellant's
silence at all.

<P20>Four of the alleged comments on Appellant's
post-arrest silence are:

<B22>And they are fantastic attorneys and
they spent all week trying to convince
you that there was a gun there that was
<Page 288>
never there, that no evidence ever said
was there until the day yesterday when
Tyreek Hall got up here and said not
what he said the night of, right? When
he admitted to murder. Not what he
said then but what he said eighteen
months later, oh yeah, that one guy
Aaron Rogers, he had a gun....

<B22>There's only one target left, and that
one target is running up the street. And
when he fires at that target, he loses all
ability, all credibility whatsoever to say,
oh, I was just shooting this way because
I saw a gun in the waistband of a guy
and I didn't remember until eighteen
months after that I saw that gun. He
loses it all....

<B22>No. He didn't want us to find that gun
because if we found that gun, you know
what we would have found. And so the
one guy for eighteen months who could
have turned over that gun, who could
have helped us locate that gun, waits
until yesterday to say it was Southwest
Reek, or excuse me, it was Dave from
Southwest who works for the school district. ...

<B22>And then eighteen months later, after he
admits to murder, he has the audacity to
sit in front of you folks and to say, to
say in front of the family that there was
a gun there that he just didn't mention
for eighteen months.

<P00>Appellant's Brief, 30-31.

<P20>The gist of the prosecutor's arguments
challenged co-defendant's credibility. Co-defendant
claimed that Aaron Rogers had
a gun that he pulled first. This claim was
first asserted at the time of trial, after
Aaron Rogers had passed away one month
prior. N.T. 3/6/15, 126. The prosecutor contrasted
co-defendant's testimony at trial to
what Daimeen Walker had said co-defendant
told him at the time of the shooting:
co-defendant admitted to shooting "at
them" and said, he and Appellant "had to
get out of the area because things went
bad. One of the boys was talking too reckless."
N.T. 3/3/15, 222-223. That was not a
self-defense claim, and Daimeen Walker
testified at trial that his statement was
accurate and true. N.T. 3/3/15, 253. We
find that "the Commonwealth was unarguably
entitled to comment on the credibility
of [a defense witness'] belated support of
the self-defense theory." <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Rolan,</EMBI> 964 A.2d 398, 410 (Pa. Super.
2008). This was fair response to defense
argument. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> More importantly the prosecutor's
arguments were not a comment on
Appellant's post-arrest silence at all. The
allegation of appellate counsel's ineffective
assistance with respect to these meritless
claims thus fails the first prong of the
<EMBI>Strickland</EMBI> test.

<P20>The fifth alleged comment requires
an additional explanation. Appellant
presents it as:

<B22>And so even though for the last eighteen
months everything anyone ever said was
that there was one gun there ... they
looked at the menu and they said self
defense.

<P00>Appellant's Brief, 30.

<P20>This is the one comment that does not
directly reference co-defendant's testimony.
However, in context, it questioned the
credibility of the self-defense claim, which
only co-defendant's testimony supported.
It was made at the start of the prosecutor's
summation, and was a roadmap to
why the jury should find the Commonwealth's
witnesses more credible than co-defendant.
It referred back to the opening
statement when the prosecutor told the
jury he did not know what the defense
would be: "In a case like this, they get
three options, right? Our guys weren't
there, our guys weren't the shooters, self
defense." N.T. 3/10/15, 123. He noted that
five eyewitnesses to the events testified
<Page 289>
that Appellant and co-defendant were the
assailants. "So the first two are out. They
can't say it wasn't them. They can't say
they weren't shooting. So they were left
with one option and that's what they went
with." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Immediately following this, the prosecutor
reached the selectively edited quotation
that Appellant relies upon. Tellingly, the
unedited quotation contains the explanation,
basis and direction of the comment.
The unitalicized argument is the factual
context omitted by Appellant, as follows:

<B22><EM>And so even though for the last eighteen
months everything anyone ever said
was that there was one gun there,</EM> was
that Aaron Rogers, a person they claim
had a gun, was in the middle of playing
basketball, wearing basketball shorts
and a jersey, and everyone knows you
can't have a loaded weapon on you or a
weapon of any kind while you're playing
basketball, even though those are the
facts, even though every witness was
consistent, even though every witness
was cooperative, even though the ballistics
showed that those kids were telling
the truth, <EM>they looked at the menu and
they said self defense.</EM>

<P00>N.T. 3/10/15, 123-124. In its full context,
this was an entirely proper argument, discussing
the trial evidence that undermined
the credibility of co-defendant's testimonial
assertion of self-defense. <EMBI>Rolan,</EMBI> 964 A.2d
at 410.

<P20>Appellant's third enumerated
claim is that the PCRA court erred by not
applying a standard of cumulative prejudice.
Appellant's Brief, 34-35. Such standard
is only applicable if there are multiple
errors. "[N]o number of failed claims may
collectively warrant relief if they fail to do
so individually." <EMBI>Tedford,</EMBI> 960 A.2d at 56. It
is only where multiple instances of deficient
performance are found that assessment
of prejudice properly may be premised
upon cumulation. <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Johnson,</EMBI> 600 Pa. 329, 966 A.2d 523, 532
(2009). As we find no merit to any of the 15
summation-based PCRA claims raised by
Appellant, there is no basis to conduct the
requested review. The PCRA court did not
err.

<P20>Appellant's fourth enumerated
claim alleges direct appeal counsel's ineffective
assistance for declining to raise on
appeal trial court error in denying trial
counsel's request for the jury to be read
co-defendant's testimony in response to a
jury question. Appellant's Brief, 36-41. Appellant
misconstrues the jury's question
and the trial court's ruling.

<P20>The decision to permit the
reading of trial testimony to the jury during
its deliberation is left to the trial
court's discretion. <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Johnson,</EMBI> 576 Pa. 23, 838 A.2d 663, 677
(2003); <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Peterman,</EMBI> 430
Pa. 627, 244 A.2d 723, 726 (1968). An abuse
of discretion "takes one of three forms. ...
It occurs if (1) the trial court committed an
error of law; (2) the court exercised its
judgment in a manifestly unreasonable
manner; or (3) the court's decision was the
result of partiality, prejudice, bias or ill-will,
as shown by evidence on the record."
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Ellis,</EMBI> 313 A.3d 458, 462
(Pa. Super. 2024), <EMBI>appeal denied,</EMBI> 2024 WL
4440024 (Pa., filed Oct. 8, 2024).

<P20>On the first full day of deliberations the
jury sent the trial judge the following note:
"Please provide us with a transcript of all
of Tyreek Hall's testimony." N.T. 3/11/15,
25. Rule of Criminal Procedure 646 forbids
giving a "transcript of any trial testimony"
to a jury while it is deliberating. Pa.
R.Crim.P. 646(C)(1).

<P20>Appellant's counsel, ultimately joined by
co-defendant Hall's counsel, argued that
the jury "obviously want to hear [co-defendant's]
testimony again." N.T. 3/11/15, 26.
<Page 290>
In doing so, counsel erroneously informed
the court that the Rules do not prohibit
giving the jury a transcript of trial testimony.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> He added, "I'm not even asking
for that at this juncture. I think we can
accommodate their request by having it
reread, like we do many, many times ...
by the court reporter." <EMBI>Id.,</EMBI> 26-27. The
Commonwealth suggested inquiring of the
jury if there was something specific it was
"looking for" because reading back the
"whole testimony" would take significant
time away from deliberating. <EMBI>Id.,</EMBI> 27. The
trial court was concerned that the only
way to read the testimony back would be
to have the court reporter "take some time
and organize the notes and decipher the
notes as he attempts to read it back." <EMBI>Id.,</EMBI>
28. It also noted that in 14 years as a trial
judge there had been no "instance" in
which the court "ever had anybody's testimony
read back." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Thus, after reinstructing the jury on
malice, which it also had requested, the
court responded to the jury's request for a
transcript of all of co-defendant's testimony:

<B22>... you must all recall that when I gave
you preliminary instructions I advised
you to pay close attention to the testimony
because you would be called upon to
rely on your recollection of the testimony
during the course of your deliberations.
Further, you were all permitted to
take notes. My recollection is that the
testimony was two days ago and it consumed
approximately an hour. More
crucial to the point with regards to the
question you have asked me, the rules of
court, Mr. Foreman, prohibit my sending
out any transcript of any trial testimony.
So I invite you ladies and gentlemen
to resume your deliberations and if
you have additional questions or concerns,
you should feel free to bring those
to my attention.

<P00>N.T. 3/11/15, 33-34. Although the jury did
ask multiple additional questions over the
next two days of deliberation, it did not
request that co-defendant's testimony be
read to them.

<P20>After the court explained its reasons for
not permitting the jury to have a transcript
of co-defendant's testimony as requested,
Appellant's counsel &mdash; not co-defendant's
&mdash; accused the court of "playing
semantic games with the jury." N.T.
3/11/15, 34.

<B22>THE COURT: That's an insult.

<B22>[Trial Counsel]: No, it's not.

<B22>THE COURT: These are intelligent people.
They asked for a transcript.

<B22>[Trial Counsel]: I'm putting something
on the record. You can deny it. I'm
putting it on the record.

<B22>THE COURT: I'm speaking now.

<B22>[Trial Counsel]: I want to put something
on.

<B22>THE COURT: I'm speaking now. Don't
accuse me of playing semantic games or
any other kind of games. They asked for
a transcript. The rules say they can't
have a transcript.

<P00>N.T. 3/11/15, 35. Trial counsel eventually
calmed down enough to restate the objection
as the jury wanting "the testimony of
Mr. Hall to help them decide this case.
That is clearly what they've asked for."
<EMBI>Id.,</EMBI> 36. He also added, for the record, "that
the court reporter has indicated within ten
minutes, and probably could have been
done already by this point in time, have
had that done and could have read it completely
to this jury within an hour to an
hour and a half." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>In response, the court explained its reasoning
for denying Appellant's renewed
objection:

<B22>First of all, they didn't ask to have the
testimony read back. Secondly, they
asked for a transcript, which is prohibited
<Page 291>
by Rule 646. Third, reading testimony
back to them doesn't convey to the
jury the demeanor of the testifying witness
and it is not exactly a reproduction
of what happened during the taking of
the testimony. Lastly, I'm not the least
bit concerned about time. It is in my
discretion. I've made my ruling and my
ruling stands.

<P00>N.T. 3/11/15, 37-38.

<P20>We discern no abuse of discretion in the
court's ruling. It did not, as Appellant
would have us believe, adopt an "inflexible
rule" that testimony should never be read
to the jury. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Appellant's Brief, 38-39. It
merely noted that doing so was far more
difficult than Appellant's counsel had initially
suggested. The court plainly stated
that it was exercising its discretion to deny
the request by trial counsel to have all of
co-defendant's testimony read back to the
jury.

<P20>This was a reasonable exercise of discretion,
because co-defendant's testimony was
recent &mdash; certainly compared to the four
eyewitnesses who testified during the first
two days of trial &mdash; and the court had
permitted the jury to take notes. It would
have been reversible error, if rereading co-defendant's
testimony would place "undue
emphasis on one witness's testimony." <EMBI>See
Peterman,</EMBI> 244 A.2d at 726. This would
have been likely given that the testimony
that contradicted co-defendant's claim of
self-defense had been heard the week prior.
Additionally, the trial court's concern
that having co-defendant's testimony read
to the jury by the court reporter would not
"convey to the jury the demeanor of the
testifying witness" nor would it "reproduce[e]
... what happened during the taking
of the testimony" was sufficient by
itself to affirm the court's exercise of discretion.
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Patterson,</EMBI> 180
A.3d 1217, 1235 (Pa. Super. 2018) (holding
that it was not an abuse of discretion for a
trial court to decline to have an appellant's
testimony read to a deliberating jury because
it "would not provide the jury with
the same benefit of observing [appellant]
or his demeanor or the manner in which
[appellant] testified") (internal quotation
marks omitted).

<P20>We find that the underlying claim that
the trial court abused its discretion was
without arguable merit. Counsel cannot be
deemed ineffective for having declined to
raise a meritless claim. <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Davis,</EMBI> 262 A.3d 589, 596 (Pa. Super. 2021).

<P20>Accordingly, we affirm the order denying
PCRA relief.

<P20>Order affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt*> Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior
Court.

<fnt1> 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2502(c).

<fnt2> The jury also found Appellant not guilty of
murder in the first degree, criminal conspiracy
and possessing an instrument of crime.
N.T. 3/12/15, 50. Co-defendant Hall was tried
under Docket No. CP-51-CR-0013587-2013.
The jury found co-defendant guilty of murder
in the third degree and possessing an instrument
of crime. <EMBI>Id.,</EMBI> 44. It found him not guilty
of murder in the first degree and conspiracy.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<fnt3> Appellant also argues that trial counsel's
"failure to object to these additional instances
of prosecutorial misconduct damaged direct
appeal counsel's ability to put before this
Court a full picture of the objectionable nature
of the speech as a whole." Appellant's
Brief, 28. As discussed below, none of these
ten comments warranted relief and therefore
appellate counsel's alleged inability to present
a full picture was not damaged. "While criminal
defendants often believe that the best way
to pursue their appeals is by raising the greatest
number of issues, actually, the opposite is
true: selecting the few most important issues
succinctly stated presents the greatest likelihood
of success." <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Ellis,</EMBI>
534 Pa. 176, 626 A.2d 1137, 1140 (1993). <EMBI>See
Commonwealth v. Robinson,</EMBI> 581 Pa. 154,
864 A.2d 460, 480 n.28 (2004).

<fnt4> Appellant sought review of the trial court's
denial of a mistrial on the basis of: allegedly
improper comment on post-arrest silence;
and describing defense arguments with words
such as "concocted" and "ridiculous." <EMBI>See
Direct Appeal,</EMBI> *4-*5. This Court held that the
arguments were not improper. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<fnt5> The defense argument was based on the
testimony of Gianni Bain that after the initial
fight he believed that Josiah McClarence went
to get someone bigger, or a gun, to exact
revenge. This belief led Gianni Bain and
Nkingi Jones to tell Aaron Rogers what had
happened and to return with him to the area
of the initial fight. N.T. 3/3/15, 303-304, 375-376;
N.T. 3/4/15, 84-85, 146-148.

<P20>OPINION BY <author>STEVENS</author>, <dgn>P.J.E.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Appellants William P. Werner and Donna
Werner, husband and wife, (hereinafter
"the Werners") appeal the order of the
Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County
sustaining the preliminary objection of
Appellees 1281 King Associates, LLC
("1281 King") and Martin's Famous Pastry
Shoppe, Inc. ("Martin's") (collectively "Appellees").
The Werners claim that the trial
court erred in determining that Mr. Werner
had released Appellees from liability in
this tort litigation in an agreement that
had terminated the parties' business relationship.
After careful review, we affirm.

<P20>On February 19, 2020, the Werners filed
this negligence action in Philadelphia
County against Appellees seeking damages
for serious injuries Mr. Werner sustained
on February 5, 2019 at a property owned
and operated by Martin's and/or 1281 King
that is located at 1281 King Road in West
Chester, Chester County. Complaint &para;&para;6,
10.

<P20>Mr. Werner alleged that he was lawfully
on the premises in question as a "business
invitee" and was utilizing one of Appellees'
portable ramps "provided for delivery
drivers" when a "jagged and deteriorated
edge of the ramp caught the pant leg of
[Mr. Werner], causing him to fall." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> &para;&para;8-10.
Mr. Werner reported numerous severe
injuries which included, but was not limited
to, a right hip fracture requiring surgery.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> &para;13. Mr. Werner also asserted
that, as a result of the accident, he suffered
lost wages and an impairment of his
earning capacity. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> &para; 15. Based on these
allegations, the Werners claimed that Appellees
had been reckless and negligent in
breaching their duty to properly maintain,
care, and control the premises in question.
In addition, the Werners included a loss of
consortium claim in favor of Mrs. Werner
in the complaint. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> &para;&para;17-20.

<P20>On May 8, 2020, Appellees filed preliminary
objections in which they raised multiple
issues, including a claim that venue
should be transferred from Philadelphia
County to Franklin County as well as the
contention that Mr. Werner had signed a
release of liability for the claims raised in
this lawsuit.

<P20>By way of background, Appellees asserted
in their preliminary objections that previously,
in 2014, Mr. Werner, as principal
of Werner Bread Man, LLC, had entered
into an Independent Distributor Agreement
("Distributor Agreement") with Martin's,
in which the parties designated Mr.
Werner as the exclusive independent distributor
for Martin's products in a defined
<Page 295>
geographical territory. Original Preliminary
Objections &para;11, Ex. B.

<P20>Appellees also asserted that after the
accident in this case had occurred, on
July 20, 2019, the parties entered into a
Termination, Release, Consent, and Arbitration
Agreement ("Termination Agreement")
in which Martin's agreed to allow
Mr. Werner to assign his distribution
rights to another party in exchange for
the termination of the parties' Distributor
Agreement. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> &para;13, Ex. C. &para;&para;2-4. The
Termination Agreement defines the term
"Distributor Parties" as follows:

<B22>"Distributor Parties" mean Distributor,
its affiliates and subcontractors, and
their respective directors, officers, employees,
subcontractors, agents, and representatives
and Distributor Owner(s)
and their respective heirs, executors, administrators,
persona representatives,
successors and assigns."

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Ex. C. &para;1. Mr. Werner executed the
Termination Agreement in two capacities:
(1) as President of Werner Bread Man,
LLC, and (2) as the Distributor Owner. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
Ex. C., signature page.

<P20>The Termination Agreement also contains
the following release clause in which
Mr. Werner released Martin's and its affiliates
from liability related to the Distributor
Agreement or the work performed under
that agreement:

<B22>4. <EMU>Release</EMU>. In consideration for the representations,
warranties, covenants, and
agreements of Martin's set forth in this
Agreement, the Distributor Parties
hereby release, remise, and forever discharge
the Martin's Parties to the extent
permitted by applicable law from
any and all actions, causes of action,
claims, counterclaims, crossclaims, demands,
rights, suits, debts, contracts,
agreements, demands for contribution,
demands for indemnity, damages, costs,
loss of services, expenses, commissions,
and compensation of any nature whatsoever,
whether known or unknown, fixed
or contingent and whether at law or in
equity, that any Distributor Party has or
could have asserted against Martin's
Parties at any time on or before the date
of this Agreement <EMBI>in any way arising
out of, relating to, or having any connection
with the Distributor Agreement.</EMBI> ...

<P00><EMBI>Id.,</EMBI> Ex. C. &para;4 (emphasis added).

<P20>On July 24, 2020, the Court of Common
Pleas of Philadelphia County sustained Appellees'
preliminary objection based on improper
venue and transferred the case to
Franklin County. After the Werners filed
a timely appeal, on July 16, 2021, this
Court affirmed the order transferring venue
and remanded for further proceedings.
<EMBI>Werner v. 1281 King Assocs., LLC,</EMBI> 1549
EDA 2020, 2021 WL 3015319 (Pa. Super.
July 16, 2021) (unpublished memorandum).

<P20>On December 23, 2021, Appellees filed a
second set of preliminary objections in the
Franklin County Court of Common Pleas
in which they sought, <EM>inter alia,</EM> to dismiss
this action on the basis of the release
clause in the parties' Termination Agreement.
The trial court permitted the parties
to submit briefs and heard oral argument
on the preliminary objections.

<P20>On June 7, 2022, the trial court entered
an order and opinion, sustaining Appellees'
preliminary objections in part, finding the
release clause in the Termination Agreement
"was clear and unambiguous ...
[and] release[d Appellees] from all claims
arising from the Distributor Agreement."
Trial Court Opinion (T.C.O.), 6/7/22, at 7.
However, the trial court noted that it was
overruling Appellees' preliminary objections
against Mrs. Werner's loss of consortium
claim as it found that "Pennsylvania
case law diverts on whether [a] loss of
<Page 296>
consortium claim hinges on the underlying
claim of the spouse." Order, 6/7/24, at 1.

<P20>On June 15, 2022, the Werners filed a
motion for reconsideration. On June 23,
2022, the Werners submitted an Application
for a Determination of Finality of the
trial court's June 7, 2022 order pursuant to
Pa.R.A.P. 341. On July 26, 2022, the trial
court denied both the motion for reconsideration
and the Application for a Determination
of Finality.

<P20>Over a year later, on November 2, 2023,
the parties stipulated to the discontinuance
of the claims against Appellee 1281 King
Associates, LLC. On November 15, 2023,
the Werners filed a "Praecipe to Dismiss
the Claims of [Mrs.] Werner against Martin's
Famous Pastry Shoppe, Inc., Without
Prejudice." The Werners filed a timely
notice of appeal and complied with the trial
court's direction to file a concise statement
of errors complained of on appeal pursuant
to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b).

<P20>Before we reach the merits of
this case, we must address whether this
appeal is properly before this Court.

<B22>As a general rule, "an appellate court's
jurisdiction extends only to review of
final orders." <EMBI>Shearer v. Hafer,</EMBI> 644 Pa.
571, 177 A.3d 850, 855 (2018); <EMBI>see also</EMBI>
Pa.R.A.P. 341(a) ("[A]n appeal may be
taken as of right from any final order of
a ... trial court."). A final order is an
order that "disposes of all claims and of
all parties" or "is entered as a final
order" pursuant to a determination of
finality by a trial court or other government
unit. Pa.R.A.P. 341(b)(1), (3). As
we have previously stated, "[t]he final
order rule reflects the long-held limitation
on review by both federal and state
appellate courts[,]" and "[c]onsidering issues
only after a final order maintains
distinctions between trial and appellate
review, respects the traditional role of
the trial judge, and promotes formality,
completeness, and efficiency." <EMBI>Shearer,</EMBI>
177 A.3d at 855.

<P00><EMBI>MFW Wine Co., LLC v. Pennsylvania
Liquor Control Bd.,</EMBI> ___ Pa. ___, 318
A.3d 100, 112 (2024) (quoting <EMBI>J.C.D. v.
A.L.R.,</EMBI> ___ Pa. ___, 303 A.3d 425, 429-30
(2023)).

<P20>Consistent with the final order
rule,

<B22>[i]t is well settled that the interlocutory
orders dismissing various parties piecemeal
from a lawsuit may not be appealed
until the case is concluded as to the
final remaining party and the case is
therefore resolved as to all parties and
all claims.... Rather, in such a situation,
each separate judgment becomes
appealable when the suit is resolved
against the final defendant and [an appeal]
may be commenced as to all defendants
by a single notice of appeal taken
from the order resolving the final claim
against the final defendant.

<P00><EMBI>Burkey v. CCX, Inc.,</EMBI> 106 A.3d 736, 738-39
(Pa. Super. 2014) (quoting <EMBI>Strausser v.
PRAMCO, III,</EMBI> 944 A.2d 761, 764 (Pa.
Super. 2008)). We also note that "a case
may be resolved against the final defendant
by other than an order of court, as
happens where the case against the sole
remaining defendant is discontinued or
settled." <EMBI>Burkey,</EMBI> 106 A.3d at 739. Additionally,
"a docket entry to the effect that
the claim [against the final defendant] was
discontinued or settled may serve to render
the prior judgments final and appealable."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>In this case, the filing of Mrs. Werner's
November 13, 2023 praecipe to dismiss her
claim against Martin's served as a final
disposition as to all claims and all parties
and rendered the June 7, 2022 order sustaining
Appellees' preliminary objection
readily appealable and ripe for appellate
review. <EMBI>See also Quinn v. Bupp,</EMBI> 955 A.2d
<Page 297>
1014, 1020 (Pa. Super. 2008) (noting interlocutory
orders not subject to immediate
appeal may be reviewed in a subsequent
timely appeal of a final order or judgment).

<P20>The Werners raise the following issues
for our review:

<B24>1. Whether a trial court can dismiss
[the Werners'] Complaint based on a
release raised in Preliminary Objections,
rather than raised as a defense
in New Matter, when [the
Werners] argue in their Response to
Preliminary Objections that discovery
is necessary.

<B24>2. Whether a trial court can dismiss
[the Werners'] Complaint based on a
contractual Release raised in Preliminary
Objections when the contract
is ambiguous and [the Werners]
did not draft the Release.

<B24>3. Whether an individual's personal injury
claim arising from a slip and
fall incident can be released in a
contract that does not refer to the
accident or injury?

<B24>4. Whether a Contract that releases
claims arising from a contract between
two businesses can also release
the claims of an individual who
was not a party to said contract?

<P00>Werners' Brief, at 6-7.

<P20>The Werners challenge the trial
court's decision to sustain Appellees' preliminary
objections based on the release
contained in the parties' Termination
Agreement. "Our standard of review of an
order ... overruling or sustaining preliminary
objections is to determine whether
the trial court committed an error of law.
When considering the appropriateness of a
ruling on preliminary objections, the appellate
court must apply the same standard
as the trial court." <EMBI>R.A. Greig Equip.
Co. v. Mark Erie Hosp., LLC,</EMBI> 305 A.3d 56,
59 (Pa. Super. 2023) (citing <EMBI>Bargo v.
Kuhns,</EMBI> 98 A.3d 686, 689 (Pa. Super. 2014)
(citation omitted)).

<P20>First, the Werners claim the trial court
erred in sustaining Appellees' preliminary
objections based on the release clause in
the Termination Agreement, as the Werners
assert that this was a procedurally
inappropriate stage to consider such a
claim. The Werners assert that the doctrine
of release is an affirmative defense
that must be plead in New Matter, not
preliminary objections. Werner's Brief, at
23. The Werners cite Pennsylvania Rule of
Civil Procedure 1030(a), which classify the
doctrine of release as an affirmative defense
that "shall be pleaded in a responsive
pleading under the heading New Matter."
Pa.R.C.P. 1030(a).

<P20>Appellees respond by asking this
Court to find this specific issue to be
waived as the Werners never raised this
procedural challenge to Appellees' preliminary
objections before the trial court. We
acknowledge that where a defendant raises
preliminary objections that are procedurally
defective, "the proper challenge is [for
the plaintiff] to file preliminary objections
to strike the defendant's preliminary objections
for failure of a pleading to conform
to law or rule of court." <EMBI>Devine v.
Hutt,</EMBI> 863 A.2d 1160, 1167 (Pa. Super.
2004) (quoting Pa.R.C.P. 1028(a)(2)).

<P20>This Court has specifically held that
"[w]here a party erroneously asserts substantive
defenses in preliminary objections
rather than ... in new matter, the failure
of the opposing party to file preliminary
objections to defective preliminary objections
... waives the procedural defect and
allows the trial court to rule on the preliminary
objections." <EMBI>Hvizdak v. Linn,</EMBI> 190
A.3d 1213, 1228 (Pa. Super. 2018) (quoting
<EMBI>Preiser v. Rosenzweig,</EMBI> 418 Pa.Super. 341,
614 A.2d 303 (1992)). We also emphasize
that it is well-settled that "[i]ssues not
<Page 298>
raised in the trial court are waived and
cannot be raised for the first time on
appeal." Pa.R.A.P. 302(a).

<P20>As such, the Werners waived any argument
that Appellees improperly raised the
doctrine of release in their preliminary
objections when the Werners failed to
challenge this procedural error before the
trial court by filing responsive preliminary
objections. Thus, the trial court had the
authority to review the release claim within
Appellees' preliminary objections.

<P20>In their remaining claims, the Werners
also challenge the merits of the trial
court's determination that the release
clause in the parties' Termination Agreement
contained "clear and unambiguous"
language that released Appellees from liability
on Mr. Werner's personal injury
claim. The Werners also contend that the
release clause is unenforceable as the Termination
Agreement does not refer to the
accident or injury. Further, the Werners
assert that the release did not relieve Appellees
of liability for Mr. Werner's personal
injury claims as Mr. Werner was not
a party in his individual capacity to the
Distributor Agreement.

<P20>As an initial matter, we note that
the Werners do not allege that the release
clause was procured by fraud, duress, or
mutual mistake. A release not procured by
fraud, duress, or mutual mistake is binding
between the parties. <EMBI>Front St. Dev. Assocs.,
L.P. v. Conestoga Bank,</EMBI> 161 A.3d
302, 310 (Pa. Super. 2017) (quoting <EMBI>Strickland
v. Univ. of Scranton,</EMBI> 700 A.2d 979,
986 (Pa. Super. 1997)).

<P20>Our courts have held that "[i]n
Pennsylvania, it is well settled that the
effect of a release is to be determined by
the ordinary meaning of its language."
<EMBI>Pennsbury Vill. Assocs., LLC v. Aaron
McIntyre,</EMBI> 608 Pa. 309, 322, 11 A.3d 906,
914 (2011) (quoting <EMBI>Taylor v. Solberg,</EMBI> 566
Pa. 150, 778 A.2d 664, 667 (2001) (citation
omitted)).

<B22>[W]hen construing the effect and scope
of a release, the court, as it does with all
other contracts, must try to give effect
to the intentions of the parties. <EMBI>Sparler
v. Fireman's Insurance Company of
Newark, New Jersey,</EMBI> 360 Pa.Super.
597, 521 A.2d 433 (1987) (<EM>en banc</EM>); <EMBI>Hower
v. Whitmak Associates,</EMBI> 371 Pa.Super.
443, 538 A.2d 524 (1988). Yet, the
primary source of the court's understanding
of the parties' intent must be
the document itself. <EMBI>Vogel v. Berkley,</EMBI>
354 Pa.Super. 291, 511 A.2d 878 (1986).
Thus, what a party now claims to have
intended is not as important as the intent
that we glean from a reading of the
document itself. The parties' intent at
the time of signing as embodied in the
ordinary meaning of the words of the
document is our primary concern. <EMBI>Steuart
v. McChesney,</EMBI> 498 Pa. 45, 444
A.2d 659 (1982).

<P00><EMBI>Brown v. Cooke,</EMBI> 707 A.2d 231, 232-33 (Pa.
Super. 1998) (quoting <EMBI>Flatley by Flatley
v. Penman,</EMBI> 429 Pa.Super. 517, 632 A.2d
1342 (1993)). If "the language appearing in
the written agreement is clear and unambiguous,
the parties' intent must be discerned
solely from the plain meaning of
the words used." <EMBI>Sensenig v. Greenleaf,</EMBI>
325 A.3d 654 (Pa. Super. Sept. 4, 2024)
(<EM>quoting</EM> <EMBI>Thompson v. T.J. Whipple
Const. Co.,</EMBI> 985 A.2d 221, 229 (Pa. Super.
2009)).

<P20>As noted above, the Termination Agreement
provided that Mr. Werner released
all claims against Appellees "in any way
arising out of, relating to, or having any
connection with the Distributor Agreement[,]
... the marketing, distribution, or
sale of any of Martin's products by any
Distributor Party, [or] services provided
by any Distributor Party." The Werners
suggest that any time the phrase "arising
<Page 299>
out of" is used in a contract, it must be
deemed ambiguous as our courts recognize
different concepts of causation: cause in
fact (but for cause) and proximate cause.<fnr1>

<P20>The Werners cite to <EMBI>Manufacturers
Cas. Ins. Co. v. Goodville Mut. Cas. Co.,</EMBI>
403 Pa. 603, 170 A.2d 571, 573 (1961), in
which our Supreme Court found that the
phrase "arising out of" in a specific insurance
policy was ambiguous, and thus,
should be strictly construed against the
insurer as the drafting party. As such, in
that case, the Supreme Court construed
the phrase "arising out of" in favor of the
insured, adopting a more broad interpretation
as "but for" causation, and not proximate
causation.

<P20>Relying on <EMBI>Goodville,</EMBI> the Werners contend
that the trial court in this case should
have similarly found the phrase "arising
out of" to be ambiguous and construed it in
their favor as the non-drafting party,
which would result in the more narrow
application of proximate causation. The
Werners argue that "the proximate cause
[of Mr. Werner's injuries] was not the
Distributor Agreement, the marketing,
sale, or distribution of Martin's products,
or services provided by Werner Bread
Man, LLC or its owner to Martin's." Werners'
Brief, at 29. Rather, the Werners
contend that the proximate cause of Mr.
Werner's injuries was Appellees' negligence
as set forth in their Complaint. As
such, the Werners argue that the release
does not apply to Mr. Werner's personal
injury claim.

<P20>However, our Supreme Court rejected a
similar argument in <EMBI>McCabe v. Old Republic
Ins. Co.,</EMBI> 425 Pa. 221, 223, 228 A.2d
901, 903 (1967). In that case, an insured
employer sought for its insurer to provide
recovery for the fatal injuries of one of his
employees, who was working in a trench
that collapsed on the employee. The policy
specifically excluded coverage for any liability
for the injury or death of one of the
insured's employees "arising out of and in
the course of his employment with the
insured." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> The insured employer relied
on <EMBI>Goodville</EMBI> to argue that the phrase
"arising out of" was ambiguous and thus,
should be construed against the insurance
company as drafter to mean proximate
cause. The insured employer argued that
while his employee was engaged in the
course of his employment at the time of his
death, the proximate cause of his injuries
was the absence of shoring in the trench,
not his employment.

<P20>The Supreme Court acknowledged that
it had previously found in <EMBI>Goodville</EMBI> that
the phrase "arising out of" in the coverage
clause of a particular insurance policy was
vague and ambiguous. However, the Supreme
Court emphasized that the determining
factor in the <EMBI>Goodville</EMBI> case was
the context in which the phrase was employed,
emphasizing that "[i]t does not follow
therefrom, that every time the phrase
is used in an insurance policy that an
indefinite meaning must be ascribed thereto."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 224, 228 A.2d 901. Instead, the
Supreme Court in <EMBI>Goodville</EMBI> found the exclusionary
clause was clear and definite
such that the policy precluded recovery
since there was an "obvious causal connection"
between the employee's employment
and death. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
<Page 300>

<P20>In this case, we agree with the trial
court's determination that the release
clause in the Termination Clause was clear
and unambiguous to interpret the phrase
"arising out of" as "causally connected
with" (but for causation), and not proximate
causation. The release clause contains
broad language in which Mr. Werner
released all claims against Appellees "<EMBI>in
any way arising out of, relating to, or
having any connection with</EMBI> the Distributor
Agreement[,] ... the marketing, distribution,
or sale of any of Martin's products
by any Distributor Party, [or] services provided
by any Distributor Party." Prelim.
Obj., Ex. C. &para;4 (emphasis added).

<P20>The plain language of the release clause
shows the parties intended for Appellees
to be released from claims with <EM>any</EM> causal
connection to the Distributor Agreement
or his role as a Distributor Party; this
language does not require proximate causation.
The claims in the Werners' complaint
seeking damages for the alleged
negligence of Appellees had a clear causal
connection to his activities as a Distributor
Party responsible for delivery of Martin's
products. Mr. Werner would not have been
injured on Appellees' property <EM>but for</EM> his
obligation to be on the property to fulfill
his contractual duties under the Distributor
Agreement. Thus, the release clause in
the Termination Agreement relieved Appellees
from liability with respect the instant
action in which Mr. Werner sought
to recover damages for the injuries he
sustained while performing his contractual
obligations under the Distributor Agreement.<fnr2>

<P20>In addition, the Werners have provided
no applicable support for their suggestion
that in order to release a personal injury
claim, the release clause must specifically
reference the occurrence giving rise to the
claim or any details about the incident or
bodily injury.

<P20>We find the Supreme Court's decision in
<EMBI>Buttermore v. Aliquippa Hospital,</EMBI> 522
Pa. 325, 561 A.2d 733 (1989) to be instructive.
In that case, a plaintiff, who had been
injured in an automobile accident, subsequently
executed a release in settlement
against the other driver which released
"any and all persons, associations and/or
corporations, whether known or unknown"
from "past, present, and future claims ...
arising from damage to property, bodily
injury or death resulting or to result from
an accident which occurred on or about the
3rd day of December, 1981." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 327-28,
561 A.2d at 734. The plaintiff then filed an
action against the hospital and doctors that
treated the injuries he sustained in the
accident, claiming that their negligent
treatment aggravated his injuries and
worsened his condition.

<P20>The Supreme Court emphasized that the
plain language of the release, which discharged
all claims and parties, extended to
also release the hospital and doctor who
treated the plaintiff, even though the hospital
and doctor were not specifically referenced
in the release and had not contributed
to the settlement. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> We also note that
it does not appear that the release in
<EMBI>Buttermore</EMBI> contained any reference whatsoever
to the plaintiff's treatment on the
part of the defendant physician or hospital
or any allegations of malpractice. This
Court has reaffirmed the holding in <EMBI>Buttermore,</EMBI>
clarifying that "[t]here is no requirement
that all of the parties to be
<Page 301>
discharged from liability are specifically
named within a release if the terms of the
release clearly extend to other parties."
<EMBI>Ford Motor Co. v. Buseman,</EMBI> 954 A.2d
580, 583 (Pa. Super. 2008) (citation omitted).

<P20>Consistent with the decisions
in <EMBI>Buttermore</EMBI> and <EMBI>Buseman,</EMBI> we conclude
that the broad language of the release
clause in this case clearly extended to release
Appellees from "any and all actions
... arising from" the performance of Mr.
Werner's business obligations under the
Distributor Agreement. Likewise, we decline
to impose a requirement that the
release clause must specifically reference a
particular claim or injury at issue to be
enforceable.

<P20>Moreover, we also reject the Werners'
claim that the trial court erred in determining
the Termination Agreement released
Mr. Werner's personal injury claim
against Appellees "even though [Mr. Werner]
was listed as a party because he
signed in his capacity as the owner of
Werner Bread Man LLC, not as an individual
or an employee of Werner Bread
Man, LLC." Werners' Brief, at 43.

<P20>We agree with the trial court's
assessment that Mr. Werner was indeed a
party to the Distributor Agreement that
agreed to release claims of liability against
Appellees. The very first paragraph of the
Termination Agreement states the following:

<B22>This Termination, Release, Consent, and
Arbitration Agreement (this "Agreement")
is made this July 20, 2019, by
and among Martin's Famous Pastry
Shoppe, Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation
("<EMB>Martin's</EMB>"), Werner Bread Man, LLC,
a Pennsylvania limited liability company
("<EMB>Distributor</EMB>"), and William P. Werner,
a natural person with a residence at
[home address] ("<EMB>Distributor Owner</EMB>").

<P00>Prelimin. Obj, Ex. C.

<P20>As noted above, the release clause of the
Termination Agreement stated that the
"Distributor Parties" (which included "Distributor
Owner") released "any and all actions
... <EMBI>that any Distributor Party has
or could have asserted against Martin's
Parties</EMBI> at any time on or before the date
of this Agreement in any way arising out
of, relating to, or having any connection
with the Distributor Agreement...." Prelimin.
Obj, Ex. C (emphasis added). Mr.
Werner executed the Termination Agreement
twice: once as "Member" of "Distributor"
Werner Bread, LLC and another
time as "Distributor Owner." Prelimin.
Obj, Ex. C, signature page. As such, we
conclude that the trial court did not err in
finding that Mr. Werner agreed to release
his personal claims against Martin's as a
party to the Termination Agreement.

<P20>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the
trial court's order sustaining Appellees'
preliminary objections.

<P20>Order affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt*> Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior
Court.

<fnt1> Our courts have established that:

<B22>factual cause (also referred to as cause-in-fact)
is established where it is shown that
the plaintiff's injuries would not have occurred
"but for" the defendant's alleged
conduct. To establish proximate or legal
causation, a plaintiff must adduce evidence
to show that the defendant's act was a
substantial factor in bringing about the
plaintiff's harm.

<P20>OPINION BY <author>BECK</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Dishawn Stewart ("Stewart") appeals
from the judgment of sentence entered by
the Philadelphia County Court of Common
Pleas ("trial court") following the revocation
of his probation. On appeal, Stewart
challenges the trial court's determination
that he violated his probation by failing to
complete domestic violence therapy based
on his assertion that such therapy was not
a condition of his probation. Because we
conclude that domestic violence therapy
was a valid condition of his probation, we
affirm.

<P20>This case stems from an incident during
which Stewart threatened his sister-in-law
with a gun in front of her children. On
August 31, 2019, police arrested and
charged Stewart with firearms not to be
carried without a license, carrying firearms
on public streets in Philadelphia, possessing
instruments of crime, simple assault,
and recklessly endangering another
person. On November 22, 2021, Stewart
entered a negotiated guilty plea to the
charges of carrying firearms on public
streets in Philadelphia and simple assault,
and the remaining charges were nolle
prossed. The trial court sentenced Stewart
to two years of probation. The court placed
the following conditions on Stewart's probation:

<B22>Mandatory Court Costs &mdash; Court Costs:
Defendant is to pay imposed mandatory
court costs.

<B22>Supervision &mdash; Supervision Under Domestic
Violence Unit: To be supervised
under the Domestic Violence Unit.

<B22>Stay Away Order: To stay away from
victim(s). To Remain in Effect for Duration
of Sentence.

<P00>Negotiated Guilty Plea Order, 11/23/2021.

<P20>The same day the trial court imposed
the sentence, Stewart completed his initial
intake with the Domestic Violence Unit. As
part of his supervision, the Domestic Violence
Unit required Stewart to complete
domestic violence therapy. During intake,
Stewart signed the rules for the Domestic
Violence Unit, which state, in pertinent
part:

<B22>I must complete Domestic Violence
Therapy by a licensed psychiatrist, or
psychologist trained to give Domestic
Violence specific counseling by a facility
already approved by the Department
and [d]ischarge from treatment for any
reason other than successful discharge
will result in a Violation Hearing and/or
possibly being detained.

<P00><EMBI>Gagnon</EMBI><fnr1> <EMBI>II</EMBI> Summary, 6/15/23, at 2 (unpaginated).
The Domestic Violence Unit also
provided Stewart with a copy of these
rules, per his request. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Upon activation of his medical insurance
on March 1, 2022, the Domestic Violence
Unit referred Stewart to the batterer's
intervention program at Joseph J. Peters
<Page 304>
Institute ("JJPI"), where he agreed to attend
treatment via Zoom. Throughout 2022
and into 2023, Stewart failed to consistently
attend treatment, missing numerous
sessions during a fifteen-month period. In
May 2023, Stewart missed all sessions except
one, and during the session he did
attend, his therapist had to remove him
from the Zoom call because of his abusive
and inappropriate behavior. At the end of
May 2023, JJPI discharged Stewart from
the program because of his failure to regularly
attend treatment.

<P20>In June 2023, Stewart's probation officer
requested a violation of probation ("VOP")
hearing because he failed to abide by the
requirements of supervision by the Domestic
Violence Unit, i.e., his inability to complete
domestic violence therapy. The trial
court held VOP hearings on June 20, 2023
and July 6, 2023. At the conclusion of the
July 6, 2023 hearing, the trial court found
Stewart in technical violation of his probation
for failing to complete domestic violence
therapy. The same day, the trial
court revoked Stewart's probation and resentenced
him to eleven-and-a-half to
twenty-three months in prison, followed by
two years of probation.

<P20>On September 21, 2023, Stewart filed a
petition pursuant to the Post Conviction
Relief Act ("PCRA")<fnr2> in which he requested
reinstatement of his direct appeal
rights nunc pro tunc because his appointed
counsel failed to file the direct appeal he
had requested. On October 30, 2023, the
trial court granted the petition and reinstated
Stewart's direct appeal rights. This
timely appeal followed. Both Stewart and
the trial court have complied with Pennsylvania
Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925.
Stewart presents a single claim for our
review: "Did the [trial] court illegally find
[Stewart] in violation of his probation for
failing to attend domestic violence therapy
where this therapy was not a condition of
his probation?" Stewart's Brief at 2.

<P20>When reviewing a trial court's
decision to revoke probation, we employ
the following standard:

<B42>The imposition of sentence following
the revocation of probation is vested
within the sound discretion of the trial
court, which, absent an abuse of that
discretion, will not be disturbed on appeal.
An abuse of discretion is more
than an error in judgment&mdash;a sentencing
court has not abused its discretion
unless the record discloses that the
judgment exercised was manifestly unreasonable,
or the result of partiality,
prejudice, bias or ill-will.

<B42>When assessing whether to revoke
probation, the trial court must balance
the interests of society in preventing
future criminal conduct by the defendant
against the possibility of rehabilitating
the defendant outside of prison. In order
to uphold a revocation of probation, the
Commonwealth must show by a preponderance
of the evidence that the defendant
violated his probation.

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Baumann,</EMBI> 307 A.3d
1231, 1236 (Pa. Super. 2023) (citation omitted).

<P20>Stewart argues that the trial court
abused its discretion in revoking his probation
for failing to consistently attend domestic
violence therapy. Stewart's Brief at
8-15. According to Stewart, because his
original sentencing order did not explicitly
list domestic violence therapy as a condition
of his probation, the trial court could
not revoke his probation on the basis that
he failed to attend therapy sessions. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
8-9. Stewart further asserts that the Domestic
Violence Unit did not have the authority
to impose domestic violence therapy
<Page 305>
as a condition of probation, and that
such authority solely rested with the sentencing
court. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 10-13.

<P20>A trial court may revoke a defendant's
probation if it finds, based on a
preponderance of the evidence, the defendant
either: 1) violated a specific condition
of probation or 2) committed a new crime.
42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9771; <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Foster,</EMBI>
654 Pa. 266, 214 A.3d 1240, 1243
(2019). These are the only grounds on
which a court can find a defendant in
violation of probation. <EMBI>Foster,</EMBI> 214 A.3d at
1243.

<P20>Our Supreme Court has explained that
the authority to impose the terms and
conditions of probation lies with the sentencing
court. <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Elliott,</EMBI>
616 Pa. 524, 50 A.3d 1284, 1291 (2012).
Under section 9754 of the Sentencing
Code, which governs orders of probation,
the court "shall specify at the time of
sentencing the length of any term during
which the defendant is to be supervised,"
"the authority that shall conduct the supervision[,]"
and "shall attach reasonable
conditions authorized by section 9763 (relating
to conditions of probation)." 42 Pa.
C.S. &sect; 9754(a)-(b). Section 9763(b) requires
the sentencing court to impose conditions
of probation "based on individualized circumstances"
and states that "the court
shall attach only those conditions that the
court deems necessary and the least restrictive
means available to promote the
defendant's rehabilitation and protection of
the public[.]" <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> &sect; 9763(b). Section 9763(b)
also sets forth several permissible conditions
of probation, including ordering the
defendant "[t]o undergo individual or family
counseling" and "[t]o do other things
reasonably related to rehabilitation." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
&sect; 9763(b)(4), (15).

<P20>Our Supreme Court has further explained
that the Pennsylvania Board of
Probation and Parole ("the Board") "and
its agents cannot impose any condition of
supervision it wishes, carte blanche." <EMBI>Elliott,</EMBI>
50 A.3d at 1291. The Court, however,
has "recognized that probation officers
may, consistent with their own statutory
authority, impose specific conditions of supervision
pertaining to a defendant's probation."
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Koger,</EMBI> ___ Pa.
___, 295 A.3d 699, 707 (2023). Specifically,
the Board and its agents "may impose
conditions of supervision that are germane
to, elaborate on, or interpret any conditions
of probation that are imposed by the
trial court." <EMBI>Elliott,</EMBI> 50 A.3d at 1292. The
Court reasoned that this interpretation
gives meaning to the relevant statutory
provisions and thus:

<B22>(1) maintains the sentencing authority
solely with a trial court; (2) permits the
Board and its agents to evaluate probationers
on a one-on-one basis to effectuate
supervision; (3) sustains the ability
of the Board to impose conditions of
supervision; and (4) authorizes that a
probationer may be detained, arrested,
and "violated" for failing to comply with
either a condition of probation or a condition
of supervision. In summary, a trial
court may impose conditions of probation
in a generalized manner, and the
Board or its agents may impose more
specific conditions of supervision pertaining
to that probation, so long as
those supervision conditions are in furtherance
of the trial court's conditions of
probation.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (footnote omitted).

<P20>In rejecting Stewart's claim, the trial
court concluded:

<B22>[T]he probation department acted within
the authority of the [c]ourt order when
it imposed domestic violence treatment
conditions on [Stewart]'s probation.
[Stewart]'s conviction arose from a violent
family incident. Because the order
<Page 306>
directed supervision under the Domestic
Violence Unit of probation, the probation
department's requirement for
[Stewart] to complete the specific condition
of the [b]atterer's [i]ntervention
[p]rogram was in furtherance of the
court order. [Stewart] was in technical
violation when he failed to participate in
this valid condition of his probation.

<P00>Trial Court Opinion, 2/20/2024, at 7 (record
citations omitted).

<P20>We agree. The certified record reflects
that Stewart pled guilty to a crime
stemming from an incident involving domestic
violence and consequently, the trial
court's sentencing order stated that Stewart's
probation was "to be supervised under
the Domestic Violence Unit." Negotiated
Guilty Plea Order, 11/23/2021. The
same day Stewart received his sentence of
probation, he completed his intake with the
Domestic Violence Unit during which he
signed the rules for the unit, which stated,
"I must complete Domestic Violence Therapy"
and that "[d]ischarge from treatment
for any reason other than successful discharge
will result in a Violation Hearing
and/or possibly being detained." <EMBI>Gagnon
II</EMBI> Summary, 6/15/23, at 2 (unpaginated).
Given that Stewart committed a crime involving
domestic violence and that the sentencing
order expressly informed Stewart
that his probation would be supervised by
the Domestic Violence Unit, the imposition
of the requirement that Stewart complete
domestic violence therapy was germane to
and elaborated upon the sentencing court's
decision to assign his supervision to the
Domestic Violence Unit. <EMBI>See Elliott,</EMBI> 50
A.3d at 1292; <EMBI>see also Baumann,</EMBI> 307 A.3d
at 1234-35, 1237 (stating, in a case where
the appellant was convicted of a sex offense
and, as part of his probation, was to
"submit to supervision by the Sexual Offender's
Unit[,]" the requirement that the
appellant participate in a sex offender
therapeutic treatment program was a valid
condition of supervision under the Sexual
Offender's Unit).<fnr3>

<P20>In support on his claim, Stewart cites
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Shires,</EMBI> 240 A.3d 974
(Pa. Super. 2020). Stewart's Brief at 12-13.
In <EMBI>Shires,</EMBI> the sentencing court issued two
orders regarding the appellant's conditions
of probation: an earlier order that only
required the appellant to pay costs, fines,
and restitution, and a later order that included
"standard special conditions for sex
offenders." <EMBI>Shires,</EMBI> 240 A.3d at 978. The
appellant, however, was never served with
the second probation order. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 978. The
trial court revoked his probation for failing
to comply with several of the special conditions
for sex offenders, but on appeal, this
Court determined that because the appellant
was never served with the second
order, "the only pertinent condition of probation"
was the earlier order "related to
paying costs, fines, and restitution." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
976-78. We therefore concluded that the
"special conditions for sex offenders,"
which required the appellant "to obtain
treatment and restrict his residence and
his contact with minors, plainly [were] not
germane to the sole court-imposed condition
of probation, which merely required
[him] to pay costs, fines, and restitution."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 979.

<P20><EMBI>Shires</EMBI> is readily distinguishable from
the instant case. Unlike in <EMBI>Shires,</EMBI> the
sentencing court expressly ordered Stewart's
probation to be supervised by the
Domestic Violence Unit, Stewart was
aware of this condition, and he was immediately
informed that this supervision
would include domestic violence therapy.
<Page 307>
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Negotiated Guilty Plea Order,
11/23/2021; <EMBI>see also Gagnon II</EMBI> Summary,
6/15/23, at 2 (unpaginated). Thus, we are
not persuaded by Stewart's reliance on
<EMBI>Shires.</EMBI>

<P20>Based on the foregoing, we conclude
that the requirement that Stewart complete
domestic violence therapy was germane
to and elaborated on the sentencing
court's directive to assign his supervision
to the Domestic Violence Unit. Accordingly,
the trial court did not abuse its discretion
in revoking Stewart's probation based
on his failure to consistently attend domestic
violence therapy sessions.

<P20>OPINION BY <author>STEVENS</author>, <dgn>P.J.E.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Appellant, Tommie Holmes, appeals
from the judgment of sentence entered in
the Court of Common Pleas of Washington
County after a jury found him guilty of
numerous drug offenses, enumerated <EM>infra.</EM>
Sentenced to an aggregate sentence of
not less than 10 years nor more than 20
years' imprisonment, Appellant raises
challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence,
to an evidentiary ruling, and to the
Commonwealth's use of a peremptory
strike on an African American juror. After
careful consideration, we affirm.

<P20>The trial court opinion sets forth the
pertinent procedural history of the case, as
follows:

<B22>On September 23, 2020, Detectives Jason
Fichter and Ryan McWreath of the
Washington County Drug Task Force
filed a criminal complaint against Appellant,
through which Appellant was
charged with the [firearm offenses and
drug offenses, <EM>see infra</EM>].

<B22>Appellant was arrested that same day
and was unable to post bail. Thereafter,
Appellant's preliminary hearing was
held on October 26, 2020, before Magisterial
District Juge Robert Redlinger
and all charges were held for court.

<B22>On November 13, 2020, the Commonwealth
filed a Bill of Information against
Appellant which contained the following
charges: Count 1, Possession of a Firearm
Prohibited, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6105(a)(1),
a Felony of the Second Degree; Count 2,
Possession with Intent to Deliver a Controlled
Substance, Marijuana, 35 P.S.
&sect; 780-113(a)(30), an ungraded Felony;
Count 3, Criminal Conspiracy &mdash; Possession
with Intent to Deliver a Controlled
Substance, Marijuana, 18 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 903(a)(1)/35 P.S. &sect; 780-113(a)(30), an
ungraded Felony; Count 4, Possession
with Intent to Deliver a Controlled Substance,
Cocaine, 35 P.S. &sect; 780-113(a)(30),
an ungraded Felony; Count
5, Criminal Conspiracy &mdash; Possession
with Intent to Deliver a Controlled Substance,
Cocaine, 18 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 903(a)(1)/35 P.S. &sect; 780-113(a)(30), an
ungraded Felony; Count 6, Possession of
a Controlled Substance, Marijuana, 35
P.S. &sect; 780-113(a)(16), an ungraded Misdemeanor;
Count 7, Possession of a Controlled
Substance, Cocaine, 35 P.S.
&sect; 780-113(a)(16), an ungraded Misdemeanor;
and Count 8, Possession of
Drug Paraphernalia, Plastic Baggies
and/or Digital Scales, 35 P.S. &sect; 780-113(a)(32),
an ungraded Misdemeanor.

<B22>....

<B22>Appellant's jury trial commenced on
July 12, 2022, and lasted two days. [Appellant
was represented by counsel
throughout.] On July 14, 2022, at the
conclusion of trial, the jury found Appellant
guilty at [Counts 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and
8]. Appellant was found not guilty at
Count 1, Possession of a Firearm Prohibited.
The [trial court] deferred sentencing
to October 12, 2022, [to afford
time for the completion of a presentence
investigation report].

<B22>On October 12, 2022, the [trial court
imposed an aggregate sentence of no
less than 10 years to no more than 20
years' incarceration], to be followed by
12 months of reentry supervision. Appellant
<Page 311>
was given time served as calculated
by the Department of Corrections.

<B22>On October 24, 2022, Appellant filed a
post-sentence motion, through which
Appellant raised a Motion for Judgment
of Acquittal, a Motion for a New Trial,
and a Motion to Modify Sentence. A
hearing on Appellant's post-sentence
motion was held on November 28, 2022.
Following the hearing, [the trial court],
in an order dated February 17, 2023,
denied Appellant's post-sentence motion
in its entirety.

<B22>[Appellant filed a timely counseled appeal.
Counsel failed to file both a court-ordered
Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise statement
and an appellate brief, with the
latter omission prompting this Court to
dismiss Appellant's initial appeal. Subsequently,
Appellant filed a <EM>pro se</EM> motion
with the trial court seeking removal of
counsel and reinstatement of direct appeal
rights, which the trial court/PCRA
court granted <EM>nunc pro tunc.</EM>]

<B22>Thereafter, [present counsel] entered his
appearance on behalf of Appellant and
filed the instant appeal on April 22,
2024. [The trial court] directed Appellant
to file and serve upon [it] a Concise
Statement of Matters Complained of on
Appeal in accordance with Pa.R.A.P.
1925(b). Appellant filed his Concise
Statement on May 14, 2024.

<B22>[Appellant's counseled Rule 1925(b)
statement raised the following enumerated
issues:]

<B46>1. Was the evidence at trial sufficient
to convict [Appellant on possession
with intent to deliver,
criminal conspiracy, and possession
of a controlled substance?

<B46>2. Whether the trial court [erred] by
admitting contraband found in the
residence that the [Appellant] had
no legal ties to as the facts
[showed]?

<B46>3. Whether [Appellant] was granted
a fair jury selection and trial when
the jury was [comprised] of all
Caucasian individuals?

<B46>4. Whether criminal conspiracy
merges with possession with intent
to deliver?

<B46>5. Whether the trial court abused its
discretion in sentencing [Appellant]
to ten (10) to twenty (20)
years based on Appellant's prior
record score, etc.

<B22>Appellant's Concise Statement of Matters
Complained of on Appeal, 5/14/2024.

<P00>Trial Court Opinion, 6/5/24, at 1-2, 3-4, 5.

<P20>The counseled Brief of Appellant presents
three questions for this Court's consideration:

<B24>1. Was the evidence at trial sufficient
to convict [Appellant] on possession
with intent to deliver, criminal conspiracy
and possession of a controlled
substance?

<B24>2. Whether the trial court erred by
admitting contraband found in the
residence that [Appellant] had no
legal ties to as the facts were given
at trial?

<B24>3. Whether [Appellant] was granted a
fair jury selection at trial when the
jury was comprised of all Caucasian
individuals?

<P00>Brief of Appellant, at 7.

<P20>In Appellant's first issue, he argues that
the Commonwealth failed to present evidence
sufficient to convict him on PWID,
criminal conspiracy, and possession of a
controlled substance.

<P20>When reviewing a challenge to
the sufficiency of the evidence, our standard
of review is as follows:

<B22>A claim challenging the sufficiency of
the evidence is a question of law. Evidence
will be deemed sufficient to support
<Page 312>
the verdict when it establishes each
material element of the crime charged
and the commission thereof by the accused,
beyond a reasonable doubt.
Where the evidence offered to support
the verdict is in contradiction to the
physical facts, in contravention to human
experience and the laws of nature, then
the evidence is insufficient as a matter
of law. When reviewing a sufficiency
claim, the court is required to view the
evidence in the light most favorable to
the verdict winner giving the prosecution
the benefit of all reasonable inferences
to be drawn from the evidence.
In applying the above test, we may not
[re]weigh the evidence and substitute
our judgment for the fact-finder.

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. James,</EMBI> 297 A.3d 755,
764 (Pa. Super. 2023) (citations omitted
and formatting altered), <EM>appeal denied,</EM>
309 A.3d 691 (Pa. 2023).

<P20>Our review of Appellant's argument
in support of his sufficiency issue
shows it to lack any discussion of the
evidence relating to each material element
of the crimes charged. Instead, his argument
offers only a conclusory assertion
disagreeing with the trial court's determination
that Appellant's Rule 1925(b) statement
on the issue was inadequate. From
that unsupported position, Appellant pivots
to offering generic, boilerplate law pertaining
to the weight of the evidence, an issue
that he has not raised and developed in
this appeal. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Brief of Appellant, 11-13.

<P20>Because Appellant has not developed his
sufficiency claim in any meaningful way
and otherwise conflates the distinct concepts
of the sufficiency of the evidence and
weight of the evidence,<fnr1> his first issue affords
him no relief. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 2119(a)
(providing that an appellant's argument
shall include "such discussion and citation
of authorities as are deemed pertinent.");
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Paddy,</EMBI> 609 Pa. 272, 15
A.3d 431, 443 (2011) (providing that boilerplate
allegations and bald assertions cannot
satisfy one's briefing requirements).
<EMBI>See also Commonwealth v. Ritchey,</EMBI> 266
A.3d 615 (non-precedential decision)<fnr2> (Pa.
Super. Ct. 2021) (citing <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Johnson,</EMBI> 604 Pa. 176, 985 A.2d 915, 924
(2009) (stating that "where an appellate
brief fails to provide any discussion of a
claim with citation to relevant authority[,]
or fails to develop the issue in any other
meaningful fashion capable of review, that
claim is waived.")).

<P20>In Appellant's second issue, he asks
"[w]hether the trial court erred by admitting
contraband found in the residence
that he had no legal ties to as the facts
shown [sic] at trial?" Brief of Appellant, at
14. Like the deficiencies inherent in his
first issue, Appellant's second issue fails to
develop an argument with citation to and
discussion of pertinent decisional law,
which substantially impairs our ability to
conduct meaningful review of this claim.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Brief of Appellant at 14-15. Accordingly,
his second issue fails.

<P20>Finally, Appellant contends that
the trial court denied him a fair trial when
it denied his <EMBI>Batson</EMBI> challenge during <EM>voir
dire</EM> after the Commonwealth used one of
its peremptory challenges to remove the
<Page 313>
only African American individual, Juror 39,
in the jury pool. This Court has recently
outlined the governing standard of review
of a <EMBI>Batson</EMBI> challenge:

<B44>The scope of <EM>voir dire</EM> rests in the
sound discretion of the trial court,
whose decision will not be reversed on
appeal absent palpable error. The purpose
of <EM>voir dire</EM> is to ensure the
empaneling of a competent, fair, impartial,
and unprejudiced jury. The
scope of <EM>voir dire</EM> should therefore be
limited to questions that attempt to
disclose a potential juror's lack of
qualification or fixed opinion regarding
the defendant's guilt or innocence.
A prospective juror's personal views
are of no moment absent a showing
that these opinions are so deeply embedded
as to render that person incapable
of accepting and applying the
law as given by the court.

<B22><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Scott,</EMBI> 212 A.3d 1094,
1103 (Pa. Super. 2019) (citation omitted).

<B44>"[A] prosecutor's challenge to potential
jurors solely on the basis of race
violates the Equal Protection Clause
of the United States Constitution"
pursuant to the Supreme Court of the
United States decision in <EMBI>Batson v.
Kentucky,</EMBI> 476 U.S. 79 [106 S.Ct.
1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69] (1986). <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
1105. "A <EMBI>Batson</EMBI> claim presents mixed
questions of law and fact. Therefore,
our standard of review is whether the
trial court's legal conclusions are correct
and whether its factual findings
are clearly erroneous." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (citation
omitted). When a defendant makes a
<EMBI>Batson</EMBI> challenge during jury selection:

<B66>First, the defendant must make a
<EM>prima facie</EM> showing that the circumstances
give rise to an inference
that the prosecutor struck one or
more prospective jurors on account
of race; second, if the <EM>prima facie</EM>
showing is made, the burden shifts
to the prosecutor to articulate a
race-neutral explanation for striking
the juror(s) at issue; and third, the
trial court must then make the ultimate
determination of whether the
defense has carried its burden of
proving purposeful discrimination.

<B44>The trial court should consider the
totality of circumstances when determining
whether the prosecutor acted
with discriminatory intent or engaged
in purposeful discrimination. This
Court must give great deference to a
trial court's determination that peremptory
challenges were free of discriminatory
intent, and we will not
overturn the determination unless it
was clearly erroneous.

<B22><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 1105-1106 (internal citations and
quotations omitted). Moreover,

<B44>[t]he defendant does not satisfy <EMBI>Batson</EMBI>'s
first step of <EM>prima facie</EM> evidence
merely by showing that the
prosecutor used a number of strikes
against venirepersons of one race. Nor
is it sufficient to merely point out the
fact that the prosecutor rejected a
higher percentage of African-American
potential jurors than non-African-American
potential jurors. Instead,
the defendant must preserve a full
and complete record of the asserted
<EMBI>Batson</EMBI> violation, as it would otherwise
be impossible to conduct meaningful
appellate review of the motivations
of prosecutors in individual cases
without such a record.

<B44>Within the <EM>prima facie</EM> case wherein a
defendant must establish on the record
the circumstances demonstrating
purposeful discrimination, Pennsylvania
law also requires that a defendant
must make a record specifically identifying
(1) the race or gender of all
<Page 314>
venirepersons in the jury pools, (2)
the race or gender of all venirepersons
remaining after challenges for
cause, (3) the race or gender of those
removed by the prosecutor, and (4)
the race or gender of the jurors who
served and the race or gender of jurors
acceptable to the Commonwealth
who were stricken by the defense.

<B44>In other words, for a <EMBI>Batson</EMBI> claim to
be in a posture for the trial court to
make a proper ruling, the following
must happen. First, a defendant must
make out a <EM>prima facie</EM> case on the
record to the trial court. The <EM>prima
facie</EM> case requires more than just noting
on the record the race of excluded
jurors and the numerical composition
of the prosecution's strikes.

<B44>The <EM>prima facie</EM> case must be detailed
enough for the trial court eventually
to assess whether there has been purposeful
discrimination to establish a
<EMBI>Batson</EMBI> violation. The <EM>prima facie</EM>
case must identify the circumstances a
defendant believes establishes purposeful
discrimination, including those
record items required under Pennsylvania
law. Second, once a defendant
qualifies the record with a sufficient
<EM>prima facie</EM> case, the prosecution is
then obligated to provide race-neutral
explanations for the strikes being
questioned. Finally, once the record is
complete with a defendant's <EM>prima facie</EM>
case and the prosecution's race
neutral explanations, the trial court
has a proper foundation to proceed to
the third step, in which it assesses the
totality of the circumstances surrounding
juror selection and determines
whether the defendant has
made out a case of purposeful discrimination.

<B22><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Murray,</EMBI> 248 A.3d
557, 568 (Pa. Super. 2021) (internal quotations
and citations omitted).

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Miller,</EMBI> 321 A.3d 938, at
**3-4 (non-precedential decision) (Pa. Super.
Ct. 2024).

<P20>Appellant argues that a <EM>prima
facie</EM> case of purposeful discrimination was
made because the record establishes that
the juror in question was the only African
American juror in the jury pool. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Brief
for Appellant, at 17. This argument fails
under the governing standard of review
expressed above. Even assuming arguendo
that Appellant had presented a <EM>prima facie</EM>
case, the record reveals the trial court
required the Commonwealth to state a
race-neutral explanation for striking Juror
39.

<P20>The transcript of <EM>voir dire</EM> reveals that
questioning of Juror 39 first addressed her
ability to serve impartially even though
her father is a police officer for a nearby
municipal police department not involved
with the present matter. N.T. 7/11/2022, at
202-203. The discussion shifted, however,
to whether her impartiality may be affected
by the view she expressed in her questionnaire,
namely, that she would be less
likely to believe the testimony of a police
officer or other law enforcement officer
because of their employment. N.T. at 202.
Specifically, she shared her opinion that
law enforcement has acted with what she
referred to as "racial prejudice against
African Americans." N.T. at 204. This
viewpoint, she conceded, can cause her to
doubt whether an officer is telling the
truth. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> She then qualified her answer by
stating, "I don't think that's fair to judge
every officer. I don't know if that was, like,
a generalized question or if that was just,
like, one specific officer. Like, I don't think
every &mdash; I don't think that applies to every
officer, no. But I've seen it before, so,
yeah, I guess that would change my judgment.
Yes." N.T. at 205.
<Page 315>

<P20>In response, the Commonwealth asked
Juror 39, "Would you be less likely to
believe the officers who get on the stand in
this case and testify? Would you be less
likely to believe their testimony because
they are officers than if anyone else got on
the stand?" Juror 39 answered, "I mean,
yeah. I would say yes. In my opinion, yeah,
I think I would...." N.T. at 205. When
the Commonwealth repeated the question
just for the sake of clarity, Juror 39 again
replied, "Then yes. Yes." N.T. at 206

<P20>In its Rule 1925(a) opinion, the trial
court discerned the above exchange as
providing a credible, race-neutral explanation
for the Commonwealth's peremptory
strike of Juror 39. Trial Court Opinion, at
17-20. We agree. Accordingly, we conclude
there is no basis to support Appellant's
appellate claim that purposeful discrimination
attended the Commonwealth's decision
to use its peremptory strike on Juror
39.

<P20>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.

<P20>Affirmed.

[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <author>PANELLA</author>, <dgn>P.J.E.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Troy Scott Nabried appeals from the
judgment of sentence entered in the Court
of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County
after his conviction of one count each of
possession with intent to deliver a controlled
substance ("PWID") and criminal
use of a communication facility.<fnr1> Nabried
asserts the trial court abused its discretion
in admitting certain pieces of physical evidence
and testimony and in denying his
request to hire an expert. Upon review, we
affirm.

<P20>On June 27, 2023, the Commonwealth
filed an amended information charging Nabried
with the above crimes. These
charges stemmed from a controlled purchase
of crystal methamphetamine between
a confidential informant ("CI") and
Nabried that took place on March 31, 2022.

<P20>On July 10, 2023, a two-day jury trial
commenced. At trial, three witnesses testified:
the two investigating officers, Peter
Petrucci and Brandon Walters, and a drug
identification expert, Lauren Force. Also,
an audio/video recording of the controlled
buy was admitted into evidence.

<P20>On the day of the transaction, the officers
were with the CI at her home. The CI
placed multiple calls to Nabried that went
unanswered. Nabried responded with a
text message informing the CI that he
would come to see her in about 15 minutes.
Shortly thereafter, the officers observed
Nabried arrive at the CI's house in his
vehicle. The officers provided the CI with
$500.00. The CI requested crystal methamphetamine
and "white girl," which was a
reference to powder cocaine. The CI gave
Nabried the $500.00 but did not initially
receive the drugs. Nabried left the CI's
house to retrieve the drugs. When he returned,
he provided the CI with one ounce
of what would later be identified as crystal
methamphetamine. Nabried was not taken
into custody at that time and was later
arrested on April 26, 2022.

<P20>At the conclusion of trial, the jury found
Nabried guilty of both counts. On October
11, 2023, the court sentenced Nabried to
an aggregate term of 48 to 120 months'
incarceration. This timely appeal followed.
Nabried complied with the trial court's
order to file a Rule 1925(b) statement. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b).

<P20>Nabried raises six issues for our review.

<B22>1. Whether the trial court abused its
discretion in admitting Commonwealth
Exhibit 1, AT&T phone records, into
evidence without being properly authenticated,
and therefore the records constituted
inadmissible hearsay.

<B22>2. Whether the trial court abused its
discretion in allowing the Commonwealth
Exhibit 2, text messages, to be
admitted without being properly authenticated
because no testimony was presented
from the person(s) who sent or
received the text messages.

<B22>3. Whether the trial court abused its
discretion in finding that the defense
<Page 321>
"opened the door" which allowed the
Commonwealth to introduce testimony
regarding other uncharged drug transactions,
when the defense's questioning
was narrowly tailored to avoid "opening
the door."

<B22>4. Whether the trial court abused its
discretion in allowing the affiant, Officer
Peter Petrucci, to testify to the contents
of a clandestine video and audio recording,
instead of the Confidential Informant,
in violation of the Rule against
Hearsay.

<B22>5. Whether the trial court abused its
discretion in allowing the affiant, Officer
Peter Petrucci, to testify to the contents
of a clandestine video and audio recording,
instead of the Confidential Informant,
in violation of Mr. Nabried's right
to [c]onfront [w]itnesses under the United
States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.

<B22>6. Whether the trial court abused its
discretion in denying Mr. Nabried's request
to hire an expert witness to testify
to the industry standard of Narcotics
Investigations and Techniques.

<P00>Appellant's Brief, at 3-4 (suggested answers
omitted).

<P20>Most of the issues raised by Nabried
relate to the admissibility of physical
evidence and testimony. "The admissibility
or exclusion of evidence are subject to the
abuse-of-discretion standard of review."

ruling carries a heavy burden in establishing
that the trial court abused its
discretion. <EMBI>See Commonwealth v. DiStefano,</EMBI>
___ Pa. ___, 265 A.3d 290, 297
(2021). The trial court abuses its discretion
only if it misapplies the law, or its exercise
of judgment is manifestly unreasonable or
the result of partiality, prejudice, bias or
ill-will. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 298.

<P20>In his first issue, Nabried argues that
the trial court abused its discretion in admitting
cell phone records into evidence
because the records were inadmissible
hearsay and did not meet the business
record or public record exceptions to the
hearsay rule. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Appellant's Brief, 18-23.
The Commonwealth responds that the cell
phone records met the business records
exception to the hearsay rule. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Commonwealth's
Brief, at 5-11.

<P20>Hearsay is a statement: "(1) the declarant
does not make while testifying at the
current trial or hearing; and (2) a party
offers in evidence to prove the truth of the
matter asserted in the statement." Pa.R.E.
801(c). Hearsay is inadmissible unless it
falls within one of the exceptions set forth
at Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 803. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
Pa.R.E. 802.

<P20>One such exception is the business records
exception, which provides:

<B22>The following are not excluded by the
rule against hearsay, regardless of
whether the declarant is available as a
witness:

<B22>...

<B22><EMB>(6) Records of a Regularly Conducted
Activity.</EMB> A record (which includes a
memorandum, report, or data compilation
in any form) of an act, event or
condition if:

<B44>(A) the record was made at or near
the time by&mdash;or from information
transmitted by&mdash;someone with knowledge;

<B44>(B) the record was kept in the course
of a regularly conducted activity of a
"business", which term includes business,
institution, association, profession,
occupation, and calling of every
kind, whether or not conducted for
profit;

<B44>(C) making the record was a regular
practice of that activity;
<Page 322>

<B44>(D) all these conditions are shown by
the testimony of the custodian or another
qualified witness, or by a certification
that complies with Rule 902(11)
or (12) or with a statute permitting
certification; and

<B44>(E) the opponent does not show that
the source of information or other circumstances
indicate a lack of trustworthiness.

<P00>Pa.R.E. 803(6).

<P20>Similarly, the Uniform Business Records
as Evidence Act provides, in pertinent
part, that

<B22>A record of an act, condition or event
shall, insofar as relevant, be competent
evidence if the custodian or other qualified
witness testifies to its identity and
the mode of its preparation, and if it was
made in the regular course of business
at or near the time of the act, condition
or event, and if, in the opinion of the
tribunal, the sources of information,
method and time of preparation were
such as to justify its admission.

<P00>42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 6108(b).

<P20>As observed by the trial court,
"cell phone records that a company keeps
in the regular course of business are not
excluded by the rule against hearsay and
are admissible under the business records
exception." Trial Court Opinion, 2/20/24, at
15 (citation omitted). To satisfy the business
record exception the testifying witness
need not be the custodian of the
record or have personal knowledge of the
facts reported in the business record.
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. McEnany,</EMBI> 732 A.2d
1263, 1272 (Pa. Super. 1999). Instead, "[a]s
long as the authenticating witness can provide
sufficient information relating to the
preparation and maintenance of the records
to justify a presumption of trustworthiness
of the business records of a company,
a sufficient basis is provided to offset
the hearsay character of the evidence." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
(citations omitted).

<P20>Here, AT&T kept the subject cell
phone records in the normal course of
business. Although the custodian of the
records did not testify, the trustworthiness
of the cell phone records was established
through Officer Petrucci's knowledge of
them. Specifically, the CI told Officer Petrucci
what Nabried's cell phone number
was and the officer secured a court order
to obtain the subscriber information from
AT&T for that cell phone number. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
N.T., 7/10/24, at 45. Further, Officer Petrucci
did a public record check of that
phone number which revealed that Nabried
was the owner. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI>

<P20>At trial, Officer Petrucci identified Commonwealth's
Exhibit 1 as subscriber information
from AT&T for the cell phone number.
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 47-48. The document was
obtained through court order from AT&T.
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 48. Officer Petrucci testified that
the exhibit was a fair and accurate depiction
of the information that AT&T provided,
and that it was the same information
he had obtained during the public
records check. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> The court overruled
defense counsel's objection because Officer
Petrucci confirmed the trustworthiness of
the AT&T information through his own
records. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 49.

<P20>Because the information in the record
from AT&T was corroborated by Officer
Petrucci's personal knowledge, which established
the trustworthiness of the business
record, we discern no abuse of discretion.

<P20>Next, Nabried argues that the trial
court abused its discretion in allowing text
messages to be admitted without proper
authentication because there was no testimony
presented from the sender or recipient
of the text messages. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Appellant's
Brief, at 23. The Commonwealth responds
that the text messages were properly authenticated
<Page 323>
through circumstantial evidence.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Commonwealth's Brief, at 12-16.

<P20>"[T]o satisfy the requirement of
authenticating or identifying an item of
evidence, the proponent must produce evidence
sufficient to support a finding that
the item is what the proponent claims it
is." Pa.R.E. 901(a). "[A]uthentication generally
entails a relatively low burden of
proof[.]" <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Bowens,</EMBI> 265
A.3d 730, 759 (Pa. Super. 2021) (<EM>en banc</EM>)
(citation omitted). "[A]uthentication of
electronic communications, like documents,
requires more than mere confirmation that
the number or address belonged to a particular
person. Circumstantial evidence,
which tends to corroborate the identity of
the sender, is required." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 760 (citation
omitted). Accordingly, authentication of
text messages "turns upon the depth of
direct and circumstantial evidence of authorship
marshaled by the proponent of
the text messages." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Orr,</EMBI> 255 A.3d 589, 601 (Pa. Super. 2021);
<EMBI>see also</EMBI> Pa.R.E. 901(b)(11).

<P20>In <EMBI>Orr,</EMBI> we rejected the appellant's argument
that the Commonwealth failed to authenticate
certain text messages by failing
to demonstrate that the appellant authored
the messages. <EMBI>See Orr,</EMBI> 255 A.3d at 601.
The circumstantial evidence demonstrated
that the appellant was the author of the
text messages. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> Specifically, testimony
from a witness that she bought the
phone for the appellant, the phone was
found among the appellant's belongings
when he was apprehended, and the content
of the text messages&mdash;the appellant's ongoing
custody dispute with the victim&mdash;
indicated that the appellant was the author
of the text messages. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI>

<P20>Similarly, here, Nabried's authorship
of the text messages was authenticated
through circumstantial evidence. The
text message came from the phone number
that was authenticated as Nabried's cell
phone. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 7/10/23, at 50-52. The CI
called Nabried's cell phone, which prompted
a response from Nabried at 3:42 p.m.
that he would see her in about 15 minutes.
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 51-53, 56. Consistent with that
text message, shortly thereafter Nabried
called the CI to inform her that he arrived
and police observed Nabried in his vehicle
outside of the CI's house. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 61.
This depth of circumstantial evidence demonstrated
that Nabried was the author of
the text messages. <EMBI>See Orr,</EMBI> 255 A.3d at
601. Therefore, the trial court did not
abuse its discretion in admitting the text
messages.

<P20>Nabried next argues that the trial court
erred in ruling that the defense "opened
the door" to testimony about any uncharged
drug deliveries. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Appellant's
Brief, at 36. Nabried argues that defense
counsel did not open the door because his
questions were narrowly tailored not to
elicit an answer related to any prior conduct.
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 39. We disagree.

<P20>The trial court ruled that defense counsel
"opened the door" on two occasions.
First, the trial court ruled that the following
exchange during defense counsel's
cross-examination of Officer Petrucci
"opened the door to the other undercover
controlled buys that would show [the CI's]
reliability." N.T., 7/10/23, at 108.

<B22>Q. You said you never worked with this
person before?

<B22>A. Correct....

<B22>Q. Okay, so you had no way to gauge
her reliability? And when I say reliable,
I mean that she's going to do what she
says she does and she's done it well in
the past. But you have no way to gauge
her reliability because you've never
worked with her and she's never been
an informant to your knowledge before,
correct?
<Page 324>

<B22>A. She's never been an informant of
mine prior to this investigation. But I
worked with her for several weeks during
this investigation.

<B22>Q. But you had no way to gauge her
reliability prior to beginning this investigation?

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 107-108. The trial court ruled that
this exchange "opened the door" to the
other controlled buys to show the CI's
reliability. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 108-10.

<P20>The next exchange during Officer Petrucci's
cross-examination concerned how
an unanswered phone call from the CI to
Nabried indicated to Nabried that the CI
wanted drugs. Officer Petrucci testified
that "the fact that there was a phone call
to Mr. Nabried alerted him to the fact that
the [CI] wanted an ounce of crystal methamphetamine[,]"
and that "the phone call
placed the order for the drug." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 131,
133. This led to the following exchange
between defense counsel and Officer Petrucci:

<B22>Q. No one ever answered that phone
call?

<B22>A. No.

<B22>Q. So nothing was set up with a phone
call?

<B22>A. Wrong. Yes, it was. The phone call
was enough for Mr. Nabried to know
that she wanted to order narcotics.

<B22>Q. He never answered the phone.

<B22>A. I understand that.

<B22>Q. Then how could he know?

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 134. The trial court ruled that this
exchange "opened the door" to prior drug
transactions to demonstrate how a phone
call from the CI informed Nabried that the
CI was seeking to buy drugs. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at
134-36.

<P20>"If [a] defendant delves into
what would be objectionable testimony on
the part of the Commonwealth, then the
Commonwealth can probe further into the
objectionable area." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Lewis,</EMBI> 885 A.2d 51, 54-55 (Pa. Super. 2005)
(citations omitted). "A litigant opens the
door to inadmissible evidence by presenting
proof that creates a false impression
refuted by the otherwise prohibited evidence."
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Gross,</EMBI> 241 A.3d
413, 420 (Pa. Super. 2020) (citation omitted).

<P20>Here, defense counsel's questions
created a false impression that the CI had
never bought drugs before from Nabried
and that there was no reason for Nabried
to know that a phone call from the CI
indicated that she wanted drugs. This false
impression was only dispelled by Officer
Petrucci's testimony on redirect that the
CI had previously bought drugs from Nabried
and that based on these previous
drug transactions Nabried knew that a
phone call from the CI indicated that the
CI wanted drugs. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 7/10/23, at 147-48.
Therefore, we discern no abuse of discretion.

<P20>In his fourth issue, Nabried argues that
statements made in the audio/video recording
were inadmissible hearsay statements
made by the CI and the trial court abused
its discretion in allowing Officer Petrucci
to testify about them. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Appellant's
Brief, at 26. Specifically, Nabried contests
Officer Petrucci's testimony that the CI
asked to purchase crystal methamphetamine
and "white girl" and his testimony
that "white girl" refers to powder cocaine.<fnr2>
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 27. The Commonwealth argues
that the CI's statements were not hearsay
because they were offered to provide context
rather than for the truth of the matter
<Page 325>
asserted, and that Officer Petrucci's definition
of "white girl" was not derived from
hearsay because it was based on his training
and experience. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Commonwealth's
Br. at 19-22.

<P20>As we previously observed,
hearsay is a statement: "(1) the declarant
does not make while testifying at the current
trial or hearing; and (2) a party offers
in evidence to prove the truth of the matter
asserted in the statement." Pa.R.E.
801. However, an out-of-court statement
"offered for a purpose other than proving
the truth of its contents, ... is not hearsay
and is not excludable under the hearsay
rule." <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Dargan,</EMBI> 897
A.2d 496, 500 (Pa. Super. 2006) (citation
omitted). "[S]upplying context is a non-hearsay
purpose." <EMBI>See Commonwealth v.
Ames,</EMBI> 290 A.3d 691, at 8 n.10 (Pa. Super.
filed Dec. 19, 2022) (unpublished memorandum)
(citing 1 McCormick On Evid. &sect; 56
(8th ed.)).<fnr3>

<P20>First, Officer Petrucci's testimony
about the definition of "white girl"
was based on his own training and experience,
not on hearsay. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 710/23, at
68. Second, the trial court reasoned that
the CI's statements about her intent to
purchase methamphetamine and "white
girl" did not violate the rule against hearsay
because they were not offered to prove
the truth of the matter asserted but rather
were offered to put into context statements
made by Nabried. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Trial Court
Opinion, 2/20/24, at 5-6. We discern no
abuse of discretion. The CI's statement on
the recording that she was requesting to
buy drugs from Nabried provided context
to the interaction between the CI and Nabried.
Without this context, the interaction
between the CI and Nabried would be
incomplete and confuse the jury. Thus, the
trial court's admission of the CI's statements
from the audio/video recording did
not violate the rule against hearsay and
was not an abuse of discretion.

<P20>Further, the admission of Officer
Petrucci's testimony regarding the
content of the audio/video recording of the
controlled buy was not an abuse of discretion.<fnr4>
An officer may testify to the contents
of a surveillance video if their testimony is
based on their own personal observations
and experience. <EMBI>See Commonwealth v.
Bair,</EMBI> 1681 MDA 2018, at 7, 2019 WL
3814828 (Pa. Super. filed Aug. 14, 2019)
(unpublished memorandum) (holding that
the trial court did not abuse its discretion
in allowing a police officer's testimony regarding
the contents of a recorded controlled
buy where the officer was physically
present at the scene and his testimony
was based on his personal knowledge,
<Page 326>
training, and experience with investigating
drug crimes).

<P20>In this case, the trial court reasoned
that Officer Petrucci's testimony was admissible
because it was based on his own
observations and personal knowledge of
the scene. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Trial Court Opinion,
2/20/24, at 4-6. We agree. Officer Petrucci
observed the drug transaction in real time.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 7/10/23, at 66. Thus, his testimony
was based on his own observations of
the events that occurred. Therefore, we
discern no abuse of discretion.

<P20>In his next issue, Nabried asserts that
allowing Officer Petrucci to testify about
the CI's hearsay statements violated his
right to confront the witness in violation of
the Confrontation Clause of the Pennsylvania
and United States constitutions. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
Appellant's Brief, at 28. Nabried's claim
warrants no relief.

<P20>A defendant's claim that he
was denied his right to confront a witness
under the Confrontation Clause of the
United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions
is a pure question of law for which
our standard of review is <EM>de novo.</EM> <EMBI>See
Commonwealth v. Grush,</EMBI> 295 A.3d 247,
250 (Pa. Super. 2023), <EM>appeal denied,</EM> 308
A.3d 770 (Pa. 2023). "The focus of the
Confrontation Clause is testimonial hearsay."
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Agnew,</EMBI> 299 A.3d
1001, 1007 (Pa. Super. 2023) (citation omitted).
Accordingly, the Confrontation
Clause is not implicated by the admission
of non-testimonial or non-hearsay statements.
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI>

<P20>Testimonial statements are
statements "made for the purpose of establishing
or proving some fact." <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Yohe,</EMBI> 621 Pa. 527, 79 A.3d 520,
531 (2013) (quoting <EMBI>Crawford v. Washington,</EMBI>
541 U.S. 36, 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158
L.Ed.2d 177 (2004)). To determine whether
a statement is testimonial or nontestimonial,
courts consider whether the statements
were made for the primary purpose of
establish[ing] or prov[ing] past events potentially
relevant to later criminal prosecution."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (quoting <EMBI>Davis v. Washington,</EMBI>
547 U.S. 813, 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165
L.Ed.2d 224 (2006)). Further, "the relevant
inquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose
of the individuals involved in a particular
encounter, but rather the purpose
that reasonable participants would have
had, as ascertained from the individuals'
statements and actions and the circumstances
in which the encounter occurred."
<EMBI>Michigan v. Bryant,</EMBI> 562 U.S. 344, 360,
131 S.Ct. 1143, 179 L.Ed.2d 93 (2011) (footnote
omitted).

<P20>As stated above, the out of court
statements of the CI on the audio/video
recording were not hearsay because they
were only introduced to provide context.
<EMBI>See Ames,</EMBI> 1387-88 MDA 2021, at 8 n.10.
Further, the statements were non-testimonial
because they were made for the
purpose of purchasing drugs, not for establishing
past events relevant to later
criminal prosecutions. <EMBI>See Yohe,</EMBI> 79 A.3d
at 521. Since the statements were non-hearsay
and non-testimonial the protections
of the confrontation clause are not
implicated. <EMBI>See Agnew,</EMBI> 299 A.3d at 1007.
Therefore, Nabried's claim that his Confrontation
Clause rights were violated is
without merit.

<P20>In his final issue, Nabried argues
that the trial court erred in denying
his request to hire an expert in the field of
narcotics investigation. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Appellant's
Brief, at 40. He claims that this was critical
to his defense to challenge the integrity
of the Commonwealth's investigative methods
in conducting the controlled buy. <EMBI>See
id.</EMBI> Further, Nabried contends that the
male officer's failure to "strip search" the
female CI was unsatisfactory and warranted
<Page 327>
further review by an expert. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at
42-43. We disagree.

<B42>It is well-established that indigent defendants
have a right to access the same
resources as non-indigent defendants in
criminal proceedings. The state has an
affirmative duty to furnish indigent defendants
the same protections accorded
those financially able to obtain them.
Procedural due process guarantees that
a defendant has the right to present
competent evidence in his defense, and
the state must ensure that an indigent
defendant has fair opportunity to present
his defense.

<B42>However, the provision of public funds
to hire experts to assist in the defense
against criminal charges is a decision
vested in the sound discretion of the
court and a denial thereof will not be
reversed absent an abuse of that discretion.

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Melvin,</EMBI> 172 A.3d 14,
22-23 (Pa. Super. 2017) (brackets and citations
omitted). "Generally, the trial court
will not be found to have abused its discretion
in the absence of a clear showing as to
the content, relevancy and materiality of
the testimony of the potential witnesses."
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Bell,</EMBI> 706 A.2d 855, 862
(Pa. Super. 1998) (citation omitted).

<P20>"[T]he Commonwealth is not
obligated to pay for the services of an
expert simply because a defendant requests
one. There must be some showing
as to the content and relevancy of the
proposed expert testimony before such a
request will be granted." <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Tighe,</EMBI> 184 A.3d 560, 580 (Pa. Super.
2018), <EM>aff'd but criticized,</EM> 657 Pa. 274, 224
A.3d 1268 (2020) (internal citations omitted).
Similarly, a defendant is not entitled
to public funds to hire an expert witness
where the defendant "fails to identify a
particularized need for such assistance related
to a colorable issue presented in his
defense[.]" <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Howard,</EMBI>
553 Pa. 266, 719 A.2d 233, 242 (1998).
Importantly, an expert is not essential to
the defense where cross-examination of a
witness at trial serves the same purpose as
the expert testimony. <EMBI>See Commonwealth
v. Lambert,</EMBI> 270 A.3d 1153, at *9 (Pa.
Super. filed Dec. 21, 2021) (unpublished
memorandum).

<P20>The trial court explained it denied
Nabried's request because he failed to
demonstrate how the police officers' handling
of the CI was relevant to the recording
of the controlled buy. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Trial Court
Opinion, 2/20/24, at 11. Furthermore, the
trial court points out that defense counsel
cross-examined the officers "at length"
about their training and experience in handling
confidential informants, so an expert's
speculative testimony would not
have offered more than what was accomplished
with cross-examination. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI>
(citing <EMBI>Lambert, supra.</EMBI>). We discern no
abuse of discretion. Defense counsel was
able to question the officers about their
investigation tactics on cross-examination.
Defense counsel cross-examined both officers
about their handling of the CI and
particularly why they did not have a female
officer to conduct a more thorough
strip search of the CI. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 7/10/23, at
110-20; N.T., 7/11/23, at 20-28. This cross-examination
served the same purpose as
the proposed expert witness of calling into
question how the officers used the CI in
their investigation. Therefore, the trial
court did not abuse its discretion in denying
Nabried's request to hire an expert
witness.

<P20>Judgment of sentence affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt*> Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior
Court.

<fnt1> 35 P.S. &sect; 780-113(a)(30) and 18 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 7512(a), respectively.

<fnt2> Considering Nabried was convicted of
PWID for crystal methamphetamine, not cocaine,
we fail to see, and Nabried does not
explain, how the statements about "white
girl" are relevant to this appeal.

<fnt3> Non-precedential decisions filed after May
1, 2019, may be cited as persuasive authority.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 126(b)(2).

<fnt4> To the extent that Nabried challenges the
admission of Officer Petrucci's testimony
regarding
the content of the audio/video recording,
rather than the CI's statements therein,
he has waived this issue. Issues not raised in
the trial court are waived and cannot be
raised for the first time on appeal. Pa.R.A.P.
302(a). Further, "[t]he rule is well settled that
a party complaining on appeal of the admission
of evidence in the [c]ourt below will be
confined to the specific objection there
made." <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Santiago-Burgos,</EMBI>
314 A.3d 535, 545 (Pa. Super. 2024) (citation
omitted). Accordingly, "[i]f counsel states the
grounds for an objection, then all other unspecified
grounds are waived and cannot be
raised for the first time on appeal." <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Lopez,</EMBI> 57 A.3d 74, 82 (Pa. Super.
2012) (citations omitted). At trial, defense
counsel only objected to the admission of the
CI's statements in the audio/video recording
but never objected to Officer's Petrucci's testimony.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 7/10/23, at 13-15, 63. Defense
counsel's failure to object on these specific
grounds resulted in waiver. However, as discussed
above, even if not waived, the claim
would not merit relief.

<P20>Lindley Tower Realty Co., L.P. (LP);
Old Lindley Corporation; Philip C. Pulley;
and SBG Management Services PA, Inc.
(collectively, Appellants) appeal from the
August 8, 2024 Order (dated July 29, 2024)
of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia
County (Trial Court), which granted a
permanent injunction against Appellants
and in favor of the City of Philadelphia
(City) and authorized, among other things,
the demolition of a structure on Appellants'
property (Trial Court Order). The
Trial Court Order arose from a Complaint
filed against Appellants, Paul Early, and
Pacific Western Bank<fnr1> (Complaint) by the
City on September 20, 2022. Upon review,
we vacate the Trial Court Order, and remand
for further proceedings on an expedited
basis.

<CN><EMB>I. Factual and Procedural Background</EMB>

<P20>Appellants own or otherwise have an
interest<fnr2> in property located at 1220 Lindley
Avenue in the City, which includes a
seven-story apartment building with a predominantly
brick fa&ccedil;ade (Building). On
September 14, 2022, the Building, which
was occupied at that time, suffered a partial
fa&ccedil;ade collapse. That same day, the
City inspected the Building and, on September
16, 2022, the City issued a Violation
Notice and Order to Correct (Violation
Notice) to LP ordering the timely
correction of the noticed violations. The
Violation Notice relayed several findings
related to the Building's fa&ccedil;ade and
deemed the property "Imminently Dangerous."
<EM>See</EM> Original Record (O.R.) Item No.
118 (Hearing Exhibits) at City Exhibit A.

<P20>On September 20, 2022, the City filed
the Complaint and an Emergency Motion
for Preliminary Special Injunction (September
Motion) in the Trial Court. The
Complaint alleged that Appellants failed to
maintain the Building "in accordance with
the minimum standard set by Title 9[<fnr3>] and
<Page 330>
with the Fire Code[] and the Property
Maintenance Code ([PM Code]) of the
Philadelphia Building Construction and
Occupancy Code, Title 4 of the Philadelphia
Code of General Ordinances (Code)."<fnr4>
Complaint &para; 111. The Complaint sought an
order compelling Appellants to abate the
public nuisance at the Building and correct
all violations of the Code, imposing statutory
fines and fees as authorized under the
Code, and imposing all abatement costs
incurred by the City upon Appellants. <EM>Id.</EM>
at Wherefore Clause. The Trial Court held
a hearing on the September Motion, which
was ultimately granted by agreement of
the parties. The September 22, 2022 order
(September 2022 Order) granting the request
for preliminary injunction found that
the Building was imminently dangerous,
no longer habitable, and a danger to the
health, safety, and welfare of the public.
O.R. Item No. 18 (September 2022 Order).
The September 2022 Order, in relevant
part, directed Appellants to put in place
certain safeguards to protect the passing
public and instructed them to cause a Licensed
Professional Structural Engineer to
conduct a survey of the fa&ccedil;ade and provide
a report to the Trial Court. <EM>Id.</EM> The Report
was to include an engineer's assessment of
the current condition of the Building's fa&ccedil;ade
and a plan including the steps necessary
to remove the imminently dangerous
designation and to make the Building safe.
<EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>Appellants partially complied with the
September 2022 Order<fnr5> and hired the engineering
firm O'Donnell & Naccarato
(O&N) to conduct a fa&ccedil;ade assessment and
prepare a report (O&N Report), which was
completed on September 23, 2022. The
O&N Report rated the condition of the
Building's fa&ccedil;ade as "Extremely Poor,"
which indicated that the fa&ccedil;ade was
deemed unsafe with potential collapse of
portions; that temporary make-safe plans
needed to be immediately implemented;
that physical deficiencies, damage and deterioration
were easily visible throughout
the fa&ccedil;ade; and that the fa&ccedil;ade required
extensive and immediate repairs. O&N Report.
The O&N Report also classified the
fa&ccedil;ade as "Unsafe" as defined by the PM
Code &sect; 315.<fnr6> The O&N Report stressed
that it was based on a <EMB>"limited, visual,
non-invasive observation</EMB> of <EMB>only</EMB> the
[B]uilding fa&ccedil;ades." O&N Report at 9 (emphasis
in original).

<P20>On October 19, 2022, the City filed an
Emergency Motion for Modification of the
Preliminary Special Injunction Issued September
22, 2022 (October Motion). The
Trial Court held a hearing on the October
Motion, which was ultimately granted by
stipulation of the parties. The October 24,
2022 Order (October 2022 Order) modified
the September 2022 Order and, in relevant
part, set forth a schedule for Appellants to
obtain and begin work under a make-safe
permit for partial demolition of the fa&ccedil;ade.
O.R. Item No. 31 (October 2022 Order).
The October 2022 Order instructed Appellants
that work under an issued permit
<Page 331>
must be commenced no later than February
1, 2023. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>Appellants failed to comply with the October
2022 Order to begin work to make
the Building safe or demolish it before
February 1, 2023, and on July 23, 2024, the
City filed an Emergency Motion for Permanent
Injunction and Order to Vacate
and Demolish (July 2024 Motion). O.R.
Item No. 110 (July 2024 Motion). The Trial
Court conducted a hearing on the July
2024 Motion on July 26, 2024, and July 29,
2024. At the hearing, the City presented
copies of a Violation Notice and Order to
Correct<fnr7> regarding the Building, a copy of
the O&N Report, and photographs taken
around the exterior of the Building from
the time period between September 14,
2022, and July 25, 2024. The City also
offered the testimony of two Department
of Licensing & Inspections (L&I) officials
related to the current condition of the
Building.

<P20>Stephen Gallagher, Director of emergency
services, inspections, and safety compliance
for L&I<fnr8> testified that, when he was
last inside the Building in January of 2024,
he observed water from an unknown
source dripping down inside the first-floor
stair tower on the northwest side of the
Building. <EM>See</EM> Notes of Testimony (N.T.)
7/26/24 at 117-119. When questioned by the
Trial Court about what type of repair work
he would expect to see, Mr. Gallagher
replied that he expected to see "[r]emov[al
of] the [B]uilding and damaged fa&ccedil;ade
down to a safe level [and] remov[al of]
loose bulging material from the fa&ccedil;ade,"
and indicated that he had not seen any
such work performed. <EM>See id.</EM> at 132. Addressing
the issue of whether the Building
was in imminent danger of collapse, Mr.
Gallagher stated:

<B22>I base that on my visual observations of
the [B]uilding and the information that
was provided [to] me by a structural
engineer that the steel structure had
eroded apart and was not load-bearing
and had separated. So[,] we were told it
was in imminent danger of collapse by
O'Donnell Naccarato.

<B22>....

<B22>The opinion is that portion of the
[B]uilding is in imminent danger of collapse
until something has been done
with it. Nothing has been done with it. It
currently is being supported by a couple
[of] bricks. And if someone knocks those
bricks or takes those bricks out &mdash;

<B22>....

<B22>&mdash; it will collapse. That was, again, told
to me by a structural engineer.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 142-143. On cross-examination, Mr.
Gallagher conceded that he had not been
inside the Building to inspect since 2022,
and that any inspection at that time was
impeded because the walls were drywall
and plaster, that his inspection of the exterior
of the Building was a visual inspection,
and that he relied on the O&N engineer
for a closer inspection. <EM>Id.</EM> at 156-157.
When questioned specifically about the
<Page 332>
O&N Report, Mr. Gallagher confirmed
that the Report was a "limited visual non-invasive
observation of only the [B]uilding
fa&ccedil;ade." <EM>Id.</EM> at 165-166. When asked whether
the City inspected the interior structure
of the Building, Mr. Gallagher answered:

<B22>No, we did not look at the structural
frame of the [B]uilding. We were only
alerted to the section of the collapse
where the steel had eroded and there
was no physical connection to &mdash;and the
engineer's recommendations in [the
O&N Report].

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 173.

<P20>During the hearing on the July 2024
Motion, the City also presented the testimony
of Inspector James Slover from
L&I's Contractual Services Unit. Mr. Slover
testified that he has been to the Building
several times over the past two years
to do inspections and take pictures. Mr.
Slover opined that further damage could
have occurred because more water has
entered the Building. N.T. 7/29/24 18-19.
During his testimony, Mr. Slover acknowledge
that his inspections of the Building
were "[e]xterior inspections only, because
the [B]uilding is fenced and closed off,
stating [s]o what we do is walk around and
make sure there's no more other sections
of the [B]uilding that's collapsed." <EM>Id.</EM> at
22. During cross-examination it was established
that Mr. Slover did not ask Appellants
if he could do an interior inspection
of the Building but that he was in the
Building at one point when the City invited
contractors for a demolition walk-through.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 31.

<P20>Erik Villari, a structural engineer licensed
as a professional engineer in the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, testified
at the hearing on behalf of Appellants. Mr.
Villari testified that he did not believe it
would be possible to determine whether
the steel structure of a building is in imminent
danger of collapse by doing only a
visual inspection of the exterior because

<B22>[t]he building fa&ccedil;ade works together
with the building structure. The structure
is what holds up the floors. It does
support the weight of the walls, but the
fa&ccedil;ade is not typically one of the primary
load-carrying elements of the
building.

<B42>When they build a building, they build
the steel frame, pour the concrete floors.
It can stand there all by itself without
any exterior walls. So in order to evaluate
the structure, if we saw problems or
signs, big bulges, we would recommend
exploratory work. We would do it at the
parts that look bad, we would do it at
the parts that appear good, to determine
if there is &mdash; we would call it, like, a
cancer throughout the structure.

<B42>And there's just &mdash; as of now, the only
thing you can see is where the fa&ccedil;ade
has collapsed. That's the only exposed
structure.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 56. When asked whether he would
agree with statements that an opinion
could be given that the Building is in imminent
danger of collapse based on an exterior
visual inspection, Mr. Villari disagreed,
noting that

<B22>[y]ou're only seeing a certain snapshot
of the [B]uilding structure seven floors
up. You don't know&mdash; the columns could
be completely fine below there. They
could also be bad below there. You don't
know until you do some exploratory
work.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 57.

<P20>The Trial Court found the testimony and
evidence presented by the City at the
hearing on the July 2024 Motion to be
credible, Trial Court Order &para; 24, and indicated,
without explanation, that it found
the testimony of Appellants' witnesses not
credible. <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 25. The trial court found the
following facts regarding the property:
<Page 333>

<B22>20. The [Building] remains imminently
dangerous and presents a continuous
dangerous condition because of the following:

<B44>a. [Appellants] failed to take meaningful
steps to complete any of the critical
work identified in the O&N [R]eport
that is necessary to make the
subject premises safe;

<B44>b. The "[e]xtremely [p]oor" conditions
identified in the O&N Report that create
a risk of potential catastrophic
collapse remain;

<B44>c. [Appellants'] failure to promptly
remediate the conditions at the subject
premises exposed the structure to
additional seasonal freeze/thaw cycles
that likely caused further deterioration
of the already imminently dangerous
conditions;

<B44>d. There is visible evidence of further
deterioration, including expansion of
existing bulge(s) in the masonry structure
and deterioration in areas that
are not immediately near the prior
partial fa&ccedil;ade collapse;

<B44>e. Demolition of the [Building] at the
subject premises is expected to take
months;

<B44>f. Delay in commencing with the demolition
would expose the structure to
an additional freeze/thaw cycle that
risks further deterioration of the already
imminently dangerous conditions;

<B44>g. Delay in commencing with the demolition
thus increases the risk of a
potential catastrophic collapse;

<B44>h. [Appellants] continue to maintain,
without credibility, that prompt action
to correct the violations at the subject
premises is not necessary to protect
the public and prevent a potential catastrophic
collapse;

<B44>i. [Appellants] lack the demonstrated
financial ability to correct the violations
at the subject premises in a
timeline and manner necessary to protect
the public and prevent a potential
catastrophic collapse;

<B44>j. [Appellants] will not correct the violations
at the subject premises in a
timeline and manner necessary to protect
the public and prevent a potential
catastrophic collapse;

<B44>k. A catastrophic collapse would occur
in close proximity to occupied residences;
and

<B44>l. A catastrophic collapse would occur
in close proximity to multiple
churches, high-traffic commercial
businesses, the Broad Street subway
system's Logan Station and a health
center.

<B22>21. The [Building] constitutes a public
nuisance and remains a clear and immediate
threat to the health, safety, and
welfare of neighboring properties and
the public.

<B22>22. No practical alternative to demolition
exists to remedy that threat.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> &para;&para; 20-22.

<P20>The Trial Court then concluded that
"[t]he City is entitled to permanent injunctive
relief because it established all the
elements necessary to support such relief
and that demolition is needed to protect
the health, safety, and welfare of the community."
<EM>Id.</EM> &para; 23. The Trial Court ordered
the following relief:

<B22>1. The City ... and/or its contractors
are hereby authorized to enter the Subject
Premises to abate the imminently
dangerous conditions via demolition of
the [Building].

<B22>2. [Appellants] and all known and unknown
occupants shall vacate the Subject
Premises.

<B22>3. If any person is found to be in the
[B]uilding located at the Subject Premises,
<Page 334>
the Office of the Sheriff of Philadelphia
and/or the Philadelphia Police Department
is hereby directed to provide
any such person with a copy of this
Order. If any such person refuses to
leave the [B]uilding immediately after
receiving a copy of this Order, they are
authorized, without the need for a writ
of possession, to use whatever reasonable
force is necessary to remove any
such person.

<B22>4. After demolition of the [Building],
[Appellants] shall thereafter maintain
the Subject Premises in compliance with
all applicable requirements of the ...
Code and other applicable law. After
demolition, the City shall be permitted
to inspect the Subject Premises to determine
compliance with the ... Code and
applicable law.

<B22>5. Pursuant to Pennsylvania law, the
Philadelphia Code, and the [L&I]'s Regulations,
[LP] is a responsible party for
the costs incurred by the City for any
work performed directly or by contract
to abate the violation of the ... Code
and remediate the imminently dangerous
conditions of the Subject Premises,
including but not limited to the costs
related to the demolition, such as, <EM>inter
alia,</EM> services of a professional engineer,
demolition, sealing the lateral, stucco,
asbestos removal, grading or ramping,
and weatherproofing. In addition, [Appellant]
LP is responsible for a twenty-one
percent (21%) administrative fee.

<B22>6. All costs associated with the demolition
will be billed in the name of [Appellant]
LP and if not paid in full within
thirty (30) days may be entered as a lien
against the Subject Premises. The City
is authorized to enter all costs as a
judgment against [Appellant] LP upon
Praecipe to the Prothonotary.

<P00>Trial Court Order at Wherefore Clause
&para;&para; 1-6.

<P20>On August 14, 2024, Appellants filed the
Notice of Appeal in this Court challenging
the Trial Court Order and, on September
6, 2024, filed an "Emergency Application
for Stay of Demolition Order Pending Appeal"
(Emergency Application) in this
Court. The Court granted a temporary
stay that same day pending oral argument
on the Emergency Application. Thereafter,
the City filed an Answer in opposition and
Appellee PRP-Yurt IV, LLC filed an Answer
indicating that it was not opposed to
the request. Argument on the Emergency
Application was held on September 19,
2024 and, on September 20, 2024, the
Court granted the Emergency Application
and directed expedited consideration on
the merits of this appeal. <EM>See</EM> Memorandum
and Order (9/20/2024).

<CN><EMB>II. Discussion</EMB>

<CN><EMB>A. The Parties' Arguments</EMB>

<P20>Appellants argue that the trial court
erred in authorizing "the radical remedy of
demolition" of Appellants' private property
where the City failed to present concrete
evidence that no "practical alternatives" to
demolition exist. Appellants' Brief at 20
(citing <EM>City of Phila. v. A Kensington
Joint,</EM> 301 A.3d 988, 999 (Pa. Cmwlth.
2023)) (quoting <EM>King v. Twp. of Leacock,</EM>
122 Pa.Cmwlth. 532, 552 A.2d 741, 744
(1989)). Specifically, Appellants aver that
the City was required to establish that the
"<EMBUI>only</EMBUI> way to remediate the danger to the
health, safety and welfare of the public is
to destroy Appellants' [B]uilding &mdash; in an
exercise of the police power, and at Appellants'
expense." Appellants' Brief at 25
(emphasis in original). While Appellants do
not contest that the Building was deemed
unsafe by Code inspectors, that it is currently
unsuitable for habitation, or that
they have failed to comply with the deadlines
set forth in the October 2022 Order,
they argue that the October 2022 Order
<Page 335>
authorized the City to make the repairs
necessary to make the Building safe and to
charge Appellants for all costs incurred.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 26. Despite Mr. Slover's agreement
that the repairs outlined in the O&N Report
would be a practical alternative to
taking the Building down, the City chose
"to pursue demolition rather than less
costly measures to eliminate the alleged
imminent threat to public safety."<fnr9> <EM>Id.</EM> at
28. Instead of authorizing demolition, Appellants
contend that the Trial Court
should have authorized the City to implement
the remedial measures contained in
the O&N Report that the City's witness,
Mr. Slover, agreed would make the Building
safe. <EM>Id.</EM> at 29-30.

<P20>Appellants further argue that the trial
court improperly relied on the testimony
of Code inspectors as to their opinions
about the structural integrity of the Building,
opining that the Building was in imminent
danger of collapse and that demolition
was the appropriate remedy. <EM>Id.</EM> at 22-23.
Appellants assert that while Code inspectors
Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Slover
could be qualified as experts on matters
concerning the Code, "their background
does not provide the necessary expertise
to opine about a building's structural integrity."
<EM>Id.</EM> at 30 (citing <EM>A Kensington
Joint,</EM> 301 A.3d at 1001-1002). Appellants
argue that the condition of the Building is
a matter outside Mr. Gallagher's and Mr.
Slover's credentialed expertise, and that
the Trial Court committed reversible error
by relying on their testimony. Appellants'
Brief at 30. Additionally, Appellants note
that Mr. Slover did not establish during
his testimony how he could determine that
the Building was in imminent danger of
collapse through a visual inspection of the
exterior only. Appellants posit that while
Mr. Slover indicated that he did not need
to be an inspector to make that determination,
he would need an inspector to tell him
that the Building was safe. <EM>Id.</EM> at 31-32
(citing N.T., 7/29/24 at 14). Finally, Appellants
discuss the testimony of their witness,
Mr. Villari, a licensed professional
engineer who testified that it would not be
possible to opine about the structural integrity
of the Building from a visual inspection
of the exterior and noted that
additional analysis would be needed.

<P20>In response, the City argues that the
Trial Court's decision was based on substantial
evidence that supports the finding
that the Building is structurally unsound,
that it constitutes a threat to public safety,
and that there is no practical alternative to
demolition. City Brief at 19. Primarily, the
City argues that its police powers include
the power to demolish a structure when
necessary to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the public. <EM>Id.</EM> at 21 (citing
<EM>Balent v. City of Wilkes-Barre,</EM> 542 Pa.
555, 669 A.2d 309, 314 (1995)). Additionally,
the City asserts that it has statutory authority
to demolish a structurally unsound
building where necessary to abate the risk
to the public. City Brief at 21 (citing Section
1 of the Act of June 15, 1961, P.L. 445,
<EM>as amended,</EM> 53 P.S. &sect;&sect; 14611, and Section
4 of the Act of May 16, 1923, P.L. 207, <EM>as
amended,</EM> 53 P.S. &sect; 7107; Phila. Home
Rule Charter, Article V, Ch. 10, &sect; 5-1002;
Phila. Code &sect; PM-110.4). The City contends
that a building does not need to be
on the brink of a complete collapse before
demolition is an appropriate remedy. Rather,
demolition is appropriate where it is
the only practical option to abate "a danger
to the health, safety, and welfare of
the public." City Brief at 23 (<EM>citing King,</EM>
552 A.2d at 744).
<Page 336>

<P20>In support of its argument that the Trial
Court's decision was based on substantial
evidence, the City points to the October
22, 2022 Order, to which Appellants stipulated,
and which found that the conditions
of the Building rendered it imminently
dangerous and that measures that Appellants
admitted were not undertaken were
necessary to remedy those conditions. City
Brief at 25 (citing October 2022 Order;
N.T. 7/29/24 at 124). The City then referenced
the testimony of Mr. Slover relating
to the worsening condition of the Building.
Specifically, the City highlighted testimony
indicating that the unrepaired front fa&ccedil;ade
of the Building had been exposed to rain
and water runoff which could result in
brick ties rusting, and that the Building
was a danger to the public because bricks
or steel beams could fall, hitting a person
or property. City Brief at 26 (citing N.T.
7/29/24 at 9-10, 17-18, 25-26). The City
argues that Mr. Slover's testimony is sufficient,
and that this Court has previously
affirmed demolition orders based on testimony
from city code officials. <EM>Id.</EM> (citing
<EM>City of Phila. v. Urban Mkt. Dev., Inc.,</EM> 48
A.3d 520, 523-24 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2012); <EM>City
of Erie v. Stelmack,</EM> 780 A.2d 824, 826 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 2001); and <EM>City of Pittsburgh v.
Kronzek,</EM> 2 Pa.Cmwlth. 660, 280 A.2d 488,
492 (1971)). While the City acknowledges
that this Court, in <EM>A Kensington Joint,</EM>
distinguished those cases and found that
an engineer's report was needed to establish
sufficient evidence of structural deterioration,
it argues that such a report should
not be needed under these circumstances.
In particular, the City equates the instant
situation to that in <EM>Borough of Shenandoah
v. Cruz</EM> (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 715 C.D.
2016, filed May 22, 2017), 2017 WL
2224520 (unreported), where the record
supporting demolition included testimony
that the building had "a hole in the roof
the size of a Volkswagen," and argues that
the evidence established by the partial collapse
of the fa&ccedil;ade and the delay in repair
are sufficient. City Brief at 27-28. Additionally,
the City argues that the O&N
Report agreed with the observations of the
Code inspectors. <EM>Id.</EM> at 28.

<P20>The City next argues that the Trial
Court correctly concluded that there was
substantial evidence showing that no practical
alternative to demolition existed. The
City emphasizes that Appellants failed to
make repairs in the 22 months between
the fa&ccedil;ade collapse and the hearing on the
July 2024 Motion. Because of this, the
City argues that "the record supports the
[T]rial [C]ourt's finding that [Appellants]
have proven incapable of restoring the
Building to an acceptable condition with
the expedience necessary to protect the
public." <EM>Id.</EM> (citing <EM>Urban Mkt. Dev.,</EM> 48
A.3d at 523). In particular, the City highlighted
testimony of Appellant Phillip C.
Pulley confirming that Appellants had not
done the required work, obtained the required
permits, or fully secured the required
financing for the project. City Brief
at 30-31. The City argues that Appellants'
demonstrated inability or unwillingness to
make the necessary repairs to the Building
makes demolition the only practical
way to abate the public danger, despite a
possibility that the Building could be repaired.
Further, the City argues that it
does not make sense to require the City to
make repairs to the Building and then
seek repayment.<fnr10> The City asserts that
<Page 337>
Appellants were given the opportunity to
elect whether to demolish or repair the
Building and that their failure to do so in
a timely manner authorizes the City to
demolish the Building to abate the dangerous
condition. <EM>Id.</EM> at 33.

<CN><EMB>B. Nature of Action; Scope and
Standard of Review</EMB>

<P20>Generally, "[o]ur scope [and
standard] of review in an equity action is
limited to the determination of whether
the [Trial Court's] findings of fact are supported
by substantial evidence, whether an
error of law has been made, or whether
the [Trial Court] abused [its] discretion."
<EM>King,</EM> 552 A.2d at 743. To establish the
right to a permanent injunction, a party
must show that "(1) the right to relief is
clear; (2) the relief is necessary to prevent
an injury which cannot be compensated by
damages; and (3) greater injury will occur
from refusing the injunction than from
granting it." <EM>A Kensington Joint, LLC,</EM>
301 A.3d at 998 (quoting <EM>First Phila. Preparatory
Charter Sch. v. Dep't of Educ.,</EM>
179 A.3d 128, 132 n.2 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018)).

<CN><EMB>C. Analysis</EMB>

<P20>This Court has previously observed
that an order of demolition constitutes a
taking pursuant to the police power without
compensation. As such, it must be
subject to strict scrutiny and undertaken
only when necessary for the protection of
the public health, welfare, and safety. <EM>A
Kensington Joint,</EM> 301 A.3d at 998 (citing
<EM>King,</EM> 552 A.2d at 744).

<P20>In <EM>King,</EM> this Court considered the question
of whether the remedy of demolition
was supported by the trial court's factual
findings. <EM>See King,</EM> 552 A.2d at 744-45.
After a hearing, the trial court entered an
order directing the owners to demolish the
building. <EM>Id.</EM> at 743. We observed that the
trial court could have fashioned remedies
less radical than demolition, including the
municipality performing work at the owners'
expense. <EM>Id.</EM> at 744. Ultimately, this
Court concluded that the trial court's findings
were insufficient where the owners
had performed recent remedial work that
the trial court did not consider and no
specific factual finding was made that the
structure was unsafe. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>The City argues that we should distinguish
<EM>King</EM> because the building at issue
there was being demolished for aesthetic
reasons and many of the aesthetic issues
had been remedied before the demolition
hearing. While the building in <EM>King</EM> still
required about $40,000 in repairs to make
it habitable, it was vacant and there was
no danger of collapse. Conversely, the City
argues that the Trial Court in this instance
had "copious evidence" to support its finding
that the Building was a threat to public
safety and "ample evidence" that there
was no practical alternative to demolition.
City Brief at 24.

<P20>The City largely relies on Mr. Slover's
testimony as a Code inspector to support
the remedy of demolition. Despite Appellants'
challenges to Mr. Slover's expertise
discussed above, the City states that "not
only did Inspector Slover's expertise meet
the legal standard for admissibility,[<fnr11>] but
his findings were also corroborated by the
O&N Report." The City also points to
testimony during the hearing on the July
2024 Motion that suggested worsening
conditions and the risk cold weather could
pose for the Building's structural integrity.
The City emphasizes that Appellants had
<Page 338>
agreed that the Building was imminently
dangerous when they stipulated to the October
2024 Order. No work has been done
to abate that condition, so the City argues
that Appellants should be precluded from
attempting to argue that the Building is
not imminently dangerous.

<P20>The Court concludes that the evidence
in the record does not constitute
substantial evidence to support the Trial
Court's determination that the Building's
structure has deteriorated to the point
where it is in imminent danger of collapse.
<EM>See King,</EM> 552 A.2d at 744 (finding it troubling
that the trial court had not found
that the building was in imminent danger
of collapse). The Trial Court relied on the
testimony of Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Slover
and on the O&N Report to establish the
structural integrity of the Building as of
the date of the hearing. While the Court
made references to the witnesses' expertise
during the hearing, both witnesses
were permitted to testify as to their opinions
about the structural stability of the
Building, an issue outside the scope of
their professional fields. Additionally, although
the O&N Report is an engineering
report, the City attempts to reframe it as
something that it is not. The O&N Report
clearly states that it is based on a "<EMB>limited,
visual, non-invasive observation</EMB> of
<EMB>only</EMB> the [B]uilding fa&ccedil;ades[,]" but despite
this, the City argues that the Report indicates
that the Building, as a whole, is
beyond its useful life. O&N Report at 9
(emphasis in original); <EM>see also</EM> City Brief
at 19.<fnr12> No interior inspections of the
Building have ever been performed.<fnr13> <EM>See
supra</EM> at 6, 7 (testimony of Mr. Gallagher
and Mr. Slover). On that basis, the Court
distinguishes <EM>Urban Market Development,</EM>
where this Court affirmed the trial court's
demolition order relying on a violation notice
that specified that "the floor/ceiling
assembly, a wall, and the roof of the
[p]roperty were all deteriorated and in
danger of collapse," as well as testimony
from a code inspector that "there was no
interior floor system, the roof was compromised,
and the [p]roperty was in extremely
dangerous condition and represented significant
danger to the public." <EM>Urban Mkt.
Dev.,</EM> 48 A.3d at 523, 524. This conclusion
appears to have followed an interior inspection
of the property.

<P20>Likewise, the Court contrasts the instant
matter with <EM>Stelmack,</EM> where this
Court upheld a demolition order against a
substantial evidence challenge. <EM>See</EM> 780
A.2d 824. In <EM>Stelmack,</EM> the city's fire code
inspector testified to the fire code violations
on the property and limited his testimony
to his experience, stating that the
property was "in an unsafe condition from
a fire perspective[.]" <EM>Id.</EM> at 828. Additionally,
unlike in the instant matter, evidence
was apparently presented of an interior
inspection that revealed debris and numerous
code violations, as well as evidence
that it would be cost prohibitive to bring
<Page 339>
the building back to a habitable condition.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 825, 828. The City also cites to
<EM>Kronzek</EM> for the premise that an inspector's
testimony, photographs, and "knowledge
of proper building standards" are
sufficient to constitute substantial evidence.
City Brief at 26-27 (citing <EM>Kronzek,</EM>
280 A.2d at 492). The <EM>Kronzek</EM> Court, however,
does not specify what type of inspection
was put into evidence. The dissent in
<EM>Kronzek</EM> is nevertheless illustrative, indicating
that there was an "entry on private
property by government inspectors[.]"
This characterization suggests that there
was at least an up-close, if not a full,
interior inspection of the properties. Finally,
this Court distinguishes <EM>Cruz,</EM> where, in
addition to establishing that there was "a
hole in the roof the size of a Volkswagen,"
the trial court record also contained evidence
that the sewer line had collapsed,
resulting in raw sewage filling the property
for nearly three years which had resulted
in the odor of sewage and debris from
the subject property encroaching upon
neighboring properties.

<P20>This case is most like <EM>A Kensington
Joint.</EM> While the facts are different and
there is, notably, visible damage to the
outside of the Building in this instance, the
City here, like in <EM>A Kensington Joint,</EM> has
not taken any action to assess the condition
of the interior of the Building. Indeed,
the City's witnesses represent that they
relied on an engineering report specifying,
as noted <EM>supra,</EM> that it was a "<EMB>limited,
visual, non-invasive observation</EMB> of <EMB>only</EMB>
the [B]uilding fa&ccedil;ades[,]" and their own
inspections of the property which were
comprised of observations of the Building
from behind a safety fence. O&N Report
at 9 (emphasis in original). While the
City's witnesses did testify to generally
worsening conditions due to exposure to
the elements, there is no evidence that
they endeavored to find out the current
condition of the Building. Indeed, the witnesses
relied heavily on the O&N Report
which is now more than two years old.
Additionally, aside from a brief visit in
January 2024 and a recent walkthrough
with demolition contractors noted above,
the City presented little evidence that it
has been inside the Building, let alone
inspected it. Neither is there anything in
the record to establish that alternatives to
a full demolition of the Building were ever
considered beyond permitting Appellants
time to obtain the inspections and have the
work done on their own. The record is
devoid of any sort of cost analysis establishing
the costs of demolition versus repair
of the Building or any indication that
the City has attempted to collaborate with
Appellants or complete any work to make
the Building safe and seek repayment
from Appellants. The City argues that it
does not make sense to require it to make
repairs where uncertain repayment could
result in costs being passed on to taxpayers.
City Brief at 32. Demolition is also not
without costs, however, and the City has
indicated that it is seeking to pierce LP's
corporate veil in order to recover the fines
and costs to which it may be entitled.

<CN><EMB>III. Conclusion</EMB>

<P20>For the foregoing reasons, the Court
concludes that the Trial Court erred in
ordering demolition based on the existing
record then before it in this matter. Accordingly,
the Court vacates the Trial
Court Order and remands for further proceedings
on an expedited basis.<fnr14>

<CN><EMBU>ORDER</EMBU>

<P20>AND NOW, this 16th day of October,
2024, the August 8, 2024 Order (Trial
<Page 340>
Court Order) of the Court of Common
Pleas of Philadelphia County (Trial Court)
is hereby VACATED, and this matter is
REMANDED to the Trial Court for further
proceedings on an expedited basis, as
follows:

<B24>1. Until final disposition of Philadelphia's
(City) Complaint on remand
or until otherwise ordered by the
Trial Court, the City shall take all
actions necessary to secure the
property at 1220 Lindley Avenue in
the City of Philadelphia (the Building)
to mitigate danger to the public
in the vicinity of the Building, including
from the possibility of falling
debris.

<B24>2. No persons shall be permitted to
enter the Building except (1) counsel
of record in this matter, Appellants,
City personnel, and their agents,
who shall be authorized to enter the
Building solely for the purpose of
obtaining any evidence necessary to
pursue further relief before the Trial
Court in this matter on remand, and
(2) law enforcement and emergency
services personnel. The parties shall
direct any motions regarding access
to the Building to the Trial Court,
which shall consider such motions on
an expedited basis.

<B24>3. City personnel shall enter the Building
and conduct an internal inspection.

<B24>4. The City may bill Appellants for any
costs incurred for compliance with
this Order.

<B24>5. The parties may file motions requesting
further relief from the Trial
Court, including requesting a
hearing on permanent injunctive relief,
which hearing the Trial Court
shall conduct no later than two business
days following praecipe for
such hearing, and shall issue its decision
within two business days after
the conclusion of such hearing.

<P00>Jurisdiction Relinquished.
<FN>
<fnt1> The Complaint indicates that Paul Early
(Early) was an employee and/or agent of, or
otherwise maintained a business relationship
with, Appellants and was involved in another
matter related to the subject property, and
that Pacific Western Bank was the current
assignee of the mortgage. <EM>See</EM> Original Record
(O.R.) Item No. 1 (Complaint) &para;&para; 21-23, 29. A
review of the Original Record reveals Appellants'
averment that Early is the President of
a separate entity known as the 2d Chance
Initiative and was a sublessor of 15 units in
the subject premises consisting of a seven-story
apartment building. <EM>See</EM> O.R. Item No. 8
(Sept. 2022 Answer and New Matter) &para; 21. On
October 6, 2022, the City filed a Praecipe to
Substitute Parties by Agreement to substitute
PRP-YURT IV LLC for Pacific Western Bank
as a Defendant. <EM>See</EM> O.R. Item No. 20 (Praecipe
to Substitute).

<fnt2> Lindley Tower Realty Co. L.P. (LP) is the
owner of record. Old Lindley Corporation and
Philip C. Pulley have interests in the ownership
chain, and SBG Management Services,
PA Inc. is the property management company
for the subject premises. <EM>See</EM> Complaint &para;&para; 2-20.

<fnt5> The O'Donnell & Naccarato report (O&N
Report) indicated that the the engineering
firm was hired prior to the September 2022
Order. The O&N Report indicated that investigation
of the Building's exterior was performed
on September 16, 21, and 22, 2022.

Construction and Occupancy Code) of the
Code. <EM>See</EM> PHILA., PA., CODE tit. 4, ch. 4-200.0
(2020).

<fnt7> The City presented four separately mailed
copies of a Violation Order and Notice to
Correct with a Department of Licensing and
Inspections (L&I) File Number: CF-2022-094607.
The copies were sent to LP, at 1220
Lindley Ave, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; 1095
Rydal Rd., Ste. 325, Rydal, Pennsylvania; 610
Old York Rd., Suite 375, Jenkintown, Pennsylvania;
and 1623 Chelten Ave, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania 19126. Trial Hearing Exhibits at
City Exhibit A.

<fnt8> Mr. Gallagher was admitted as an expert
and allowed to testify, over the objections of
Appellants' counsel, to his opinion about
whether the Building was in imminent danger
of collapse and the impact a collapse would
have on surrounding areas. <EM>See</EM> N.T. 7/26/24
at 139-143, 149-153.

<fnt9> Appellants have not presented any cost
analysis indicating the costs of the alternative
work they believe the City may have undertaken
in lieu of seeking demolition of the
Building.

<fnt10> On the issue of repayment, the City first
argues that any costs associated with the repairs
of the Building not paid by Appellants
would be passed on to taxpayers. It then
addresses the uncertain ownership of LP and
states it seeks to pierce the corporate veil to
recover fines and costs. The City does not
provide any evidence establishing what the
costs of demolition are or whether the work
required to abate the dangerous condition
would cost less, as alleged by Appellants. City
Brief at 32-33 n.9.

<fnt11> The legal standard for the admission of
expert opinion in Pennsylvania is outlined in
Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence, Rule 702,
Pa.R.E. 702. While this Court agrees that he
qualifies as an expert in Code inspection, the
City has not provided further explanation why
Mr. Slover is an expert in the technical field
of structural engineering.

<fnt12> The City cites the O&N Report for its contention
that the Building is beyond its useful
life. The Court observes that page three of the
O&N Report states that a "review of the existing
[B]uilding fa&ccedil;ade determined the exterior
walls generally appeared to be in <EM>Extremely
Poor</EM> condition[,]" and then refers readers to
the "Attached Structural Classification Definitions"
(Definitions) which follow the report.
<EM>See</EM> O&N Report at 3 (emphasis in original).
The Definitions refer generally to a structure
that is beyond its useful life. <EM>See id.</EM> at Definitions.
The City's characterization that the
O&N Report states the Building is beyond its
useful life is, at best, misleading.

<fnt13> Appellants attached to their Emergency
Application for Stay a copy of what purports
to be the report of an engineer based on an
extensive interior inspection of the Building.
That inspection is, however, outside the record
and does not exist for purposes of appellate
review. <EM>See B.K. v. Dep't of Pub. Welfare,</EM>
36 A.3d 649, 657 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2012).

<fnt14> The Court notes that nothing in our decision
precludes the City from pursuing further
remedies, including demolition, based on additional
evidence presented to the Trial Court
on remand.

<P20>OPINION BY <dgn>JUDGE</dgn> <author>WOLF</author>.
[MT]
<P20>The Board of Education of the School
District of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (District)
appeals an order of the Court of
Common Pleas of Allegheny County (trial
court) dated October 26, 2022, overruling
the District's preliminary objection to a
complaint filed by Roxanne West (West),
the mother and courtappointed guardian of
S.W., a 19-year-old student at the District.
For the reasons that follow, we reverse.

<CN><EMB>Background</EMB>

<P20>This case arises out of the alleged sexual
assault of S.W. on October 27, 2021, while
she was transported from the Conroy Education
Center<fnr1> to her home on a school
bus operated by A.J. Myers and Sons,
Inc.<fnr2> S.W. is an intellectually disabled student
diagnosed with Trisomy 21 (also
known as Down Syndrome). Reproduced
Record (R.R.) at 8a (Complaint &para; 8).
West's Complaint alleges that on the day
in question, S.W. arrived home from school
noticeably late and with her clothing in
disarray and partially removed. <EM>Id.</EM> at 10a
(Complaint &para; 15). In a subsequent forensic
interview conducted by the Children's Advocacy
Center of the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center Children's Hospital,
S.W. disclosed that she was sexually
abused by a substitute bus driver. <EM>Id.</EM> at
12a (Complaint &para;&para; 37-38). West's Complaint
sets forth six counts, four of which
name the District and are relevant here:
(1) Count I &mdash; negligence, (2) Count IV &mdash;
negligent infliction of emotional distress,<fnr3>
(3) Count V &mdash; assault, and (4) Count VI &mdash;
battery.<fnr4> <EM>Id.</EM> at 14a-17a, 20a-23a.
<Page 343>

<P20>The District filed a single preliminary
objection demurring to West's Complaint.
Therein, the District alleged it is
immune from both the negligence and intentional
tort claims pursuant to what is
commonly known as the Political Subdivision
Tort Claims Act (Tort Claims Act or
Act), 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 8541-8542. The District
suggested that the only potentially relevant
exception to immunity for the negligence
claims, commonly referred to as the
"sexual abuse exception," makes no exception
to immunity for victims over the age
of 18 and is therefore inapplicable in this
case. <EM>See</EM> 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8542(b)(9). Thus, the
District asked the trial court to dismiss all
of West's claims against it on that basis.
By order dated October 26, 2022, the trial
court overruled the District's preliminary
objection.<fnr5> The District appealed the trial
court's order to this Court.<fnr6>

<P20>On appeal,<fnr7> the District asserts
the trial court erred in concluding it was
not entitled to governmental immunity on
all claims asserted against it in West's
Complaint.

<CN><EMB>Relevant Law</EMB>

<P20>We begin with a review of governmental
immunity. "Generally, local
agencies are immune from tort liability
under Section 8541 of the Tort Claims
Act." <EM>Gillingham v. Cnty. of Delaware,</EM> 154
A.3d 875, 877-78 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2017) (quoting
<EM>Gibellino v. Manchester Twp.,</EM> 109
A.3d 336, 341 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015)). As to
intentional torts, this Court has explained:

<B22>It is well[]settled that where a plaintiff
has averred willful misconduct[<fnr8>] on the
part of local agency employees, [S]ection
8542(a)(2) of the Tort Claims Act, 42
Pa.C.S. &sect; 8542(a)(2), bars recovery from
the local agency because liability may be
imposed on a local agency only for negligent
acts. <EM>City of Phila. v. Glim,</EM> 149
Pa.Cmwlth. 491, 613 A.2d 613, 617
(1992); <EM>City of Phila. v. Brown,</EM> 152 Pa.
Cmwlth. 343, 618 A.2d 1236, 1238-39
(1992). In addition, [S]ection 8550 of the
Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8550, does
not create an exception to [S]ection
<Page 344>
8542(a)(2), and, as a result, a local agency
may not be held liable for the willful
misconduct of its employees. <EM>Glim,</EM> 613
A.2d at 617; <EM>Brown,</EM> 618 A.2d at 1238-39.

<P00><EM>Orange Stones Co. v. City of Reading,</EM> 87
A.3d 1014, 1022 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014). While
local agencies cannot be held liable for
intentional torts committed by their employees,
a local agency may be liable for
damages that are "(1) recoverable under
common law or a statute creating a cause
of action; (2) caused by the negligent act of
the local agency or its employees acting
within the scope of their employment; and
(3) caused by one of the specific acts enumerated
in Section 8542(b) of the Act."
<EM>Gillingham,</EM> 154 A.3d at 878; 42 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 8542(a). Section 8542(b) enumerates nine
such acts, each of which function as an
exception to a local agency's broad grant
of immunity. 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8542(b). The
sexual abuse exception is the ninth enumerated
act. It provides:

<B22><EMB>(b) Acts which may impose liability.</EMB>&mdash;
The following acts by a local agency or
any of its employees may result in the
imposition of liability on a local agency:

<B22>....

<B22><EM>(9) Sexual abuse.</EM>&mdash;Conduct which constitutes
an offense enumerated under
[S]ection 5551(7)[ of the Judicial Code,
42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5551(7),] (relating to no
limitation applicable) if the injuries to
the plaintiff were caused by actions or
omissions of the local agency which constitute
negligence.

<P00>42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8542(b)(9). Section 5551 of the
Judicial Code sets forth a list of crimes
that may be prosecuted without regard to
a statute of limitations. Subsection (7) provides:

<B22>A prosecution for the following offenses
may be commenced at any time:

<B22>....

<B22>(7) An offense under any of the following
provisions of 18 Pa.C.S. (relating to
crimes and offenses), or a conspiracy or
solicitation to commit an offense under
any of the following provisions of 18
Pa.C.S. if the offense results from the
conspiracy or solicitation, <EM>if the victim
was under 18 years of age at the time of
the offense</EM>:

<B22>Section 3011(b) (relating to trafficking in
individuals).

<B22>Section 3012 (relating to involuntary servitude)
as it relates to sexual servitude.

<B22>Section 3121 (relating to rape).

<B22>Section 3122.1 (relating to statutory sexual
assault).

<B22>Section 3123 (relating to involuntary deviate
sexual intercourse).

<B22>Section 3124.1 (relating to sexual assault).

<B22>Section 3124.2 (relating to institutional
sexual assault).

<B22>Section 3125 (relating to aggravated indecent
assault).

<B22>Section 4302 (relating to incest).

<P00>42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5551(7) (emphasis added).

<P20>Because the parties ask this Court
to interpret the language of the Tort
Claims Act, we also briefly review the
principles of statutory construction as set
forth in the Statutory Construction Act of
1972 (Statutory Construction Act), 1 Pa.
C.S. &sect;&sect; 1501-1991. "The object of all interpretation
and construction of statutes is to
ascertain and effectuate the intention of
the General Assembly." 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1921.
"The best indication of the General Assembly's
intent is the plain language of the
statute. When the words of a statute are
clear and unambiguous, we may not look
beyond the plain meaning of the statute
`under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.'"
<EM>Brewington v. City of Phila.,</EM> 650 Pa. 139,
199 A.3d 348, 354 (2018) (citing 1 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 1921(b)). The Statutory Construction Act
directs that it is only "when the words of
<Page 345>
the statute are not explicit" that the intention
of the General Assembly may be ascertained
by considering various factors,
including: (1) the occasion and necessity
for the statute; (2) the circumstances under
which it was enacted; (3) the mischief
to be remedied; (4) the objection to be
attained; (5) the former law, if any, including
other statutes upon the same or similar
subjects; (6) the consequences of a particular
interpretation; (7) the contemporaneous
legislative history; and (8) legislative and
administrative interpretations of such statute.
1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1921(c). Finally, we note
that exceptions to governmental immunity
must be narrowly construed. <EM>Brewington,</EM>
199 A.3d at 355.

<CN><EMB>Parties' Arguments</EMB><fnr9>

<CN><EM>Intentional Tort Claims</EM>

<P20>With this framework in mind, we turn to
the parties' arguments on appeal. As to the
intentional torts claims, the District argues
that the Tort Claims Act shields local
agencies from liability for intentional torts,
because the Act's exceptions to immunity
apply only for "negligent acts," not for
intentional acts. <EM>See Orange Stones,</EM> 87
A.3d at 1022. Relatedly, the District argues
that it is immune from claims for
vicarious liability based on acts committed
by either its employees or independent
contractors. West responds that although
the substitute bus driver committed the
intentional torts against S.W., that fact
does not automatically preclude a claim of
intentional torts against the District. Citing
three cases that do not involve governmental
immunity,<fnr10> West argues that in
certain circumstances the liability of the
employer may also extend to intentional or
criminal acts committed by an employee.
Moreover, she argues that the District had
an obligation to vet its staff and contractors
for any safety risk posed to students.

<CN><EM>Negligence Claims</EM>

<P20>The District next argues that it is entitled
to immunity on the negligence claims.
It submits that those claims do not fall
within the sexual abuse exception to immunity
under the Tort Claims Act because
the exception only applies where the victim
was under 18 years of age at the time of
the alleged offense. Because S.W. was 19
years old at the time of the conduct alleged
here, the sexual abuse exception is
inapplicable. During oral argument, the
District emphasized that its reading of the
sexual abuse exception is on all fours with
this Court's recent <EM>en banc</EM> decision in <EM>City
of Philadelphia v. J.S.,</EM> 2023 WL 8827104
(Pa. Cmwlth., No. 1272 C.D. 2021, filed
December 21, 2023) (unreported) (<EM>en
banc</EM>), <EM>appeal granted,</EM> 316 A.3d 619 (Pa.
2024) (<EM>J.S.</EM>), where this Court held that the
sexual abuse exception to governmental
immunity only applies where the victim
was under age 18 at the time of the alleged
conduct. The District argues <EM>J.S.,</EM> which
was handed down after briefs were submitted
in the instant matter, forecloses West's
contention that the sexual abuse exception
defeats the District's immunity on the negligence
claims.

<P20>West acknowledges this Court's recent
holding in <EM>J.S.,</EM> but maintains this case
contains distinguishing features, namely
that S.W. is diagnosed with Down Syndrome,
which renders her an "incapacitated
person" under Chapter 55 of the
<Page 346>
Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code,
relating to incapacitated persons. <EM>See</EM> 20
Pa.C.S. &sect; 5501 (defining "incapacitated
person" as "an adult whose ability to receive
and evaluate information effectively
and communicate decisions in any way is
impaired to such a significant extent that
he is partially or totally unable to manage
his financial resources or to meet essential
requirements for his physical
health and safety"). Thus, West argues,
S.W. cannot be considered an adult and
even if an age limitation is read into the
sexual abuse exception, it should not apply
here based on the unique facts of this
case. West also advances a broader public
policy argument, averring that a strict
reading of an 18-year-old age limitation
into the sexual abuse exception is not reflective
of the General Assembly's intent
to protect school-age children from sexual
abuse. She posits that disabled and non-disabled
students alike regularly reach
the age of 18 while still enrolled in Commonwealth
high schools, and "the placement
of an age limitation on the sexual
abuse immunity exception would impose a
result that is not just peculiar or harsh.
It would be manifestly unjust, and would
remove the incentive for schools to protect
students over 18 years of age as
compared to their minor classmates. This
cannot and should not be the rule in our
Commonwealth." West's Brief at 15.

<CN><EMB>Discussion</EMB>

<CN><EM>Intentional Tort Claims</EM>

<P20>As set forth in <EM>Orange Stones,</EM> the
law is settled that "where a plaintiff has
averred willful misconduct on the part of
local agency employees, [S]ection
8542(a)(2) of the Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.
C.S. &sect; 8542(a)(2), bars recovery from the
local agency because liability may be imposed
on a local agency only for negligent
acts." 87 A.3d at 1022. Here, West brought
claims of assault and battery against, <EM>inter
alia,</EM> the District, on a theory of vicarious
liability. The District is immune from these
intentional tort claims under the Act, and
the trial court erred in concluding otherwise.<fnr11>
<EM>Id.</EM>

<CN><EM>Negligence Claims</EM>

<P20>Turning to the negligence claims asserted
against the District, we find this
Court's <EM>en banc</EM> decision in <EM>J.S.</EM> dispositive.
In <EM>J.S.,</EM> a prisoner filed a complaint against
the City of Philadelphia and various employees
of the Philadelphia Department of
Prisons alleging he was sexually assaulted
in his holding cell. The prisoner's complaint
sought, <EM>inter alia,</EM> damages from the
City pursuant to the sexual abuse exception
of the Tort Claims Act insofar as the
prisoner was sexually assaulted by agents
of the City working in their official capacities.
The City filed a preliminary objection
arguing that the prisoner could not invoke
the sexual abuse exception because it is
limited to plaintiffs who were under age 18
at the time of the assault. The trial court
overruled the City's preliminary objection,
and, on appeal, this Court reversed. We
explained that "[b]y its plain terms, Section
8542(b)(9) of the Tort Claims Act specifically
incorporates the provisions of Section
5551(7) of the Judicial Code and, by
its plain terms, Section 5551(7) is specifically
limited to crimes involving a "`victim
[who] was under eighteen years of age at
the time of the offense.'" <EM>J.S.,</EM> slip op. at 8
(citing 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5551(7)). In so holding,
the <EM>J.S.</EM> Court also relied on, for persuasive
value, our unreported decision in
<EM>Caldwell v. Department of Corrections,</EM>
2021 WL 1217888 (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 365
C.D. 2020, filed March 31, 2021), <EM>appeal</EM>
<Page 347>
<EM>denied,</EM> 271 A.3d 1284 (Pa. 2022), where we
interpreted the identical sexual abuse exception
found in the Sovereign Immunity
Act to also only when the victim is under
18. <EM>See Caldwell,</EM> slip op. at 12; 42 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 8522(b)(10).

<P20>We find no reason to depart from
<EM>J.S.</EM>'s well-reasoned analysis. While we are
sympathetic to West's situation and arguments
as to why S.W. should benefit from
the sexual abuse exception, we are constrained
by the plain language chosen by
the legislature and are not permitted to
look beyond that plain language under the
"pretext of pursuing its spirit." 1 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 1921(b). Having concluded that the
words of the sexual abuse exception are
explicit, <EM>see J.S.,</EM> we decline to further
address the parties' various policy arguments
concerning the circumstances under
which the sexual abuse exception was enacted,
or the object which the legislature
sought to attain in so enacting. 1 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 1921(c) (reserving the consideration of
such factors for statutes that are not explicit).
Accordingly, we find that the trial
court also erred in overruling the District's
preliminary objection demurring to the
negligence claims.

<CN><EMB>Conclusion</EMB>

<P20>For the reasons set forth above, the trial
court's order is reversed, and the matter is
remanded to the trial court to sustain the
District's preliminary objection and dismiss
the intentional tort claims (Counts V
and VI) and negligence claims (Counts I
and IV) against the District.

<CN><EMBU>ORDER</EMBU>

<P20>AND NOW, this 6th day of November
2024, the order of the Court of Common
Pleas of Allegheny County (trial court)
dated October 26, 2022, is REVERSED,
and the matter is REMANDED to the
trial court for proceedings consistent with
the attached opinion.

[CT]
<P20>The Pennsylvania Constitution requires
that a school system provide for the needs
of the Commonwealth.<fnr1> At the very least, a
school setting should be a safe place for all
students. <EM>See, e.g., Sommers v. Hessler,</EM>
227 Pa.Super. 41, 323 A.2d 17, 19 (1974)

(holding that school bus driver who
crashed while intoxicated should receive a
sentence in the aggravated range because
he "violated his responsibility and duty of
care for thirteen children under his supervision
at the time of the offense when he
<Page 348>
was a school bus driver"). While I am
constrained to join the majority, I write
separately to express my grave concern
with the result in these circumstances.

<P20>This case reveals a glaring and inequitable
oversight in the Political Subdivision
Tort Claims Act (Tort Claims Act). There
is a serious allegation here of sexual assault
suffered by S.W., a 19-year-old intellectually
disabled student, diagnosed with
Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) by the driver
of a school bus operated by A.J. Myers
and Sons, Inc. while she was transported
from the Conroy Education Center to her
home. (Original Record (O.R.) at 28.) The
Conroy Education Center is controlled and
operated by the Pittsburgh Public School
District, Appellant here. <EM>Id.</EM> Conroy is specifically
designed for students with intellectual
disabilities and claims that it provides
a "range of services to students ages
5 through 21 who have life skills support,
autistic support, and multiple disability
support needs." (O.R. at 29.)

<P20>On the date in question, as alleged, S.W.
was picked up by her normal bus driver
but brought home by a substitute driver
S.W. had never before seen. When she
exited the bus, she appeared disheveled,
with her clothing partially removed, and
only a bra under her jacket, with her pants
slung low around her pelvic area. S.W.'s
mother found her shirt in the bottom of
her school bag. (O.R. at 30.) When asked
by her mother what had happened, S.W.
could not articulate what had happened
and began to cry. In a later forensic interview
conducted by a Children's Advocacy
Center, S.W. disclosed that she was sexually
abused by her substitute bus driver.
(O.R. at 32.) Despite the occurrence of this
horrendous act to a public school student
while being transported on a school bus, it
appears the legislature has excluded S.W.
from recovery due solely to her age.

<P20>In light of the apparent oversight by the
legislature in drafting this legislation, I
urge the General Assembly to revisit the
sexual abuse exception to the Tort Claims
Act. While it might prove difficult to carve
out an easily measurable standard for various
intellectual or other disabilities in a
case not as clear as the one at hand, the
General Assembly could at least consider
including within the sexual abuse exception
to tort liability the sexual assault of a
victim who was enrolled as a student in a
program of study at a school at any level
between Pre-Kindergarten and Grade 12.
This case clearly reflects the injustice that
can occur under the present language and
is an example of why I believe that such an
amendment is critical.

<P20>Generally, local agencies, including
school districts, are immune from tort liability
under Section 8541 of the Tort
Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8541. Section
8542(b)(9) of the Tort Claims Act, however,
provides a sexual abuse exception to immunity
under the Act if the conduct at
issue rises to the level of one of the sexual
offenses listed under 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5551(7).
Section 5551(7) of the Judicial Code, in
turn, lists sexual crimes for which the local
agency is denied immunity from tort liability
"<EM>if the victim was under 18 years of
age at the time of the offense.</EM>" (Emphasis
added.) Despite the horrendous circumstances
alleged in this case, and particularly
in light of S.W.'s intellectual incapacity,
we are nevertheless constrained by the
statute to deny recovery to S.W., who
clearly is worthy of being protected
against sexual assaults.

<P20>The mother of S.W. makes additional
compelling arguments highlighting the inequities
of this situation. S.W. is just over
18 years of age, but under Pennsylvania
law, she is considered an incapacitated
person under 20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5501. <EM>Id.</EM> at 8.
Section 5501 provides:
<Page 349>

<B22>"Incapacitated person" means an adult
whose ability to receive and evaluate
information effectively and communicate
decisions in any way is impaired to such
a significant extent that he is partially or
totally unable to manage his financial
resources or to meet essential requirement
for his physical health and safety.

<P00>20 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5501.

<P20>Pennsylvania law provides that individuals
18 years of age and older have the
right to enter into contracts and to sue and
be sued, "and the defense of minority shall
not be available to such individuals." 23
Pa.C.S. &sect; 5101 (a), (b). On the other hand,
while legally competent to make contracts,
it is clear that intellectually impaired or
incapacitated persons do not always have
the same ability to manage their affairs as
do other adults with full capacity. In particular,
I note that Section 5501 mentions
that incapacitated persons may lack the
ability to meet essential requirements for
their own physical health and safety. This
case illustrates that by drawing a bright
line at the age of 18, the legislature has
failed to provide a workable standard for
allowing recovery by victims for whom
such an exception from immunity may be
the most appropriate.

<P20>The School District argues that a proposed
amendment to House Bill 962
sought to make the sexual abuse exception
to immunity apply to the same offenses
(those listed in Section 5551(7)), which did
not limit recovery to those 18 or under, but
that it did not pass the General Assembly.
<EM>See</EM> Appellant's Br. at 15-16. This attempted
amendment, however, suggests at least
some level of concern on the part of lawmakers
regarding the arbitrariness of a
rule limiting recovery to sexual abuse
cases where the school victim of abuse is
under the age of 18; but eliminating ANY
restriction on who may recover for sexual
abuse, as the proposed amendment attempted
to do, is not the only possible
option for making the law more protective
of individuals such as S.W. A more logical
limitation on the right to recover in tort
for sexual abuse is to limit recovery to (1)
victims who are under the age of 18 when
the abuse occurs, or (2) who are enrolled in
school in a Pre-Kindergarten through
Grade 12 program.

<P20>There is precedent for finding that a
young person who is the victim of sexual
assault which occurs within a school setting
is worthy of protection. An example of
such legal protection can be found in 18
Pa.C.S. &sect; 3123.2(a.2), which makes it a
crime for a person associated with a school
to sexually abuse a student of the school.
In the context of this statute, "School" is
defined as a public or private school, intermediate
unit, or area vocational school. <EM>See</EM>
18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3124.2(a.2)(2)(iii).

<P20>I also note that our Supreme Court
granted allocatur in the Commonwealth
Court case that was relied upon by the
majority herein. That case is <EM>City of Philadelphia
v. J.S.,</EM> 2023 WL 8827104 (Pa.
Cmwlth., No. 1272 C.D. 2021, filed December
21, 2023) (unreported) (en banc), <EM>appeal
granted,</EM> 316 A.3d 619 (Pa. 2024). The
issue being considered by the Supreme
Court is "[w]hether the Commonwealth
Court incorrectly concluded that the [s]exual
[a]buse [e]xception to the ... Tort
Claims Act (42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8542(b)(9)) is only
applicable to plaintiffs who were minors at
the time they were victimized."<fnr3>
<Page 350>

<P20>In the interim, I strongly urge the members
of the General Assembly to consider
amending the statutes at issue here to
provide a similar exemption from sovereign
immunity for recovery for any primary
or secondary school that fails to protect
a student from being sexually abused.
[CJ]
<P20>CONCURRING OPINION BY <dgn>JUDGE</dgn>
<author>WALLACE</author>.
[CT]
<P20>Due to the current state of immunity
law in Pennsylvania, I am reluctantly constrained
to concur with the Majority.
While I agree the Majority has properly
applied the law in this case, I write separately
because I question the practical result
of this legislation and even the proposed
legislation, discussed <EM>infra,</EM> which is
brought to light by the regrettable facts of
this matter.

<P20>The general rule regarding governmental
immunity is found in Section 8541 of
the Judicial Code, which states: "Except as
otherwise provided in this subchapter, no
local agency shall be liable for any damages
on account of any injury to a person
or property caused by any act of the local
agency or an employee thereof or any
other person." 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8541. Thus,
this general rule favors governmental immunity,
subject only to exceptions outlined
by the legislature. Our legislature, in reaction
to "the hidden epidemic of childhood
sexual abuse" such as the "grand jury
reports from the Philadelphia Archdiocese,
the conviction of Jerry Sandusky and Monsignor
Lynn on the same day in 2012, the
Solesbury School grand jury report, the
Boy Scouts `perversion files,' the 2016 Altoona-Johnstown
Diocese grand jury investigation
of the six remaining Catholic
dioceses by our Attorney General" and the
"extent of the abuse and cover up that has
plagued our State[,]" <EM>see</EM> Legislative Journal
&mdash; House, April 10, 2019, p. 510, enacted
Section 8542(b)(9) of the Judicial Code.
Section 8542(b)(9) of the Judicial Code provides
the following acts by a local agency
or any of its employees may result in the
imposition of liability on a local agency:

<B22>Sexual abuse.&mdash;Conduct which constitutes
an offense enumerated under
[S]ection 5551(7) [of the Judicial Code]
(relating to no limitation applicable) if
the injuries to the plaintiff were caused
by actions or omissions of the local agency
which constitute negligence.

<P00>42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 8542(b)(9). Section 5551(7) of
the Judicial Code provides:

<B22>[A]ny offense under any of the following
provisions of 18 Pa.C.S. (relating to
crimes and offenses) ... <EMB>if the victim
was under 18 years of age at the time
of the offense:</EMB>

<B22>....

<B22>Section 3121 (relating to rape).

<B22>Section 3122.1 (relating to statutory sexual
assault).
<Page 351>

<B22>Section 3123 (relating to involuntary deviate
sexual intercourse).

<B22>Section 3124.1 (relating to sexual assault).

<B22>Section 3124.2 (relating to institutional
sexual assault).

<B22>Section 3125 (relating to aggravated indecent
assault).

<P00>42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5551(7) (emphasis added).

<P20>The purpose of this litigation is clearly,
to my mind, to protect society's most vulnerable
members and to provide victims an
opportunity to pursue justice in court
against public entities complacent in enabling
or covering up sexual abuse. Here,
the pertinent facts alleged in the Complaint
are as follows. S.W., a 19-year-old
intellectually disabled student with Trisomy
21 (also known as Down syndrome),
attended Conroy Education Center, which
is a school controlled and operated by the
School District of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 8a-9a.
Conroy Education Center "provides a
range of services to students ages 5
[through] 21 who have life skills support,
autistic support, and multiple disability
support needs." <EM>Id.</EM> at 9a. On October 27,
2021, while S.W. rode home from school on
a school bus, the school bus driver sexually
abused her. <EM>Id.</EM> at 9a-12a.

<P20>It seems plain to me this legislation is
intended to address exactly the type of
regrettable situation we find here. As Roxanne
West (West) argues in her brief,<fnr1>
S.W. is an "incapacitated person" and
"completely dependent on others for care
in the daily activities of her life." West's
Br. at 10. Certainly, it seems S.W. is the
type of vulnerable victim who should be
afforded the protections of Section
8542(b)(9) of the Judicial Code. However,
Section 5551(7) of the Judicial Code enumerates
the listed offenses only wherein
the victim was under 18 years of age at the
time the sexual abuse occurred. <EM>See</EM> 42
Pa.C.S. &sect; 5551(7).

<P20>In her brief, West suggests this Court
should consider why the "specific age of
(18) was chosen." West's Br. at 12. She
argues 18 is the age of majority in Pennsylvania
and cites to our statute addressing
"attainment of full age," which provides
individuals 18 years of age and older
have the right to enter into contracts and
to sue and be sued, and have no right to
assert the defense of minority. <EM>See</EM> 23 Pa.
C.S. &sect; 5101; West's Br. at 12. West notes
"incapacitated individuals," such as S.W.,
do not have the ability to enter into contracts
or sue and be sued. <EM>Id.</EM> She contends
while "S.W. was [19] years old at the time
of the assault," she "cannot be considered
an `adult.'" <EM>Id.</EM> at 10.

<P20>It is clear from the legislative journals
that our legislature expressly considered
the epidemic of "childhood" sexual abuse.
<EM>See</EM> Legislative Journal &mdash; House, April 10,
2019, p. 510. In drafting this exception, our
legislature chose the specific age of 18. I
agree with West's argument that this 18-year-old
age limitation in the sexual abuse
exception is not reflective of an intent to
protect all school-age children from sexual
abuse. This is especially true given the
Commonwealth's public schools serve students
up to 21 years of age.<fnr2> <EM>See</EM> Section
<Page 352>
1301 of the Public School Code of 1949, Act
of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, No. 14, art.
XIII, <EM>amended</EM> by the Act of June 29,
2002, P.L. 524, No. 88, &sect; 10, 24 P.S. &sect; 13-1301.

<P20>Nevertheless, as the Majority notes, this
Court is "constrained by the plain language
chosen by the legislature" and we
are "not permitted to look beyond that
plain language [of the law] under the `pretext
of pursuing its spirit.' 1 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 1921(b)." Op. at 347. Here, the legislature
chose the specific age of 18. It did not
choose the term "adulthood" or "childhood,"
which arguably would have been
more ambiguous and susceptible to West's
argument that while S.W. was over the
age of 18, she does not have the capacity
to be treated as though she is an "adult."
Certainly, our legislature knows how to
use specified ages and how to carve out
exceptions that differentiate between "children"
and disabled individuals, which our
legislature has done in other areas of the
law. For example, turning to Section 3121
of the Crimes Code, which addresses rape,
Section 3121(c) of the Crimes Code provides:
"Rape of a child.&mdash;A person commits
the offense of rape of a child, a felony of
the first degree, when the person engages
in sexual intercourse with a complainant
who is less than 13 years of age." 18
Pa.C.S. &sect; 3121(c). Meanwhile, Section
3121(a)(5) of the Crimes Code provides: "A
person commits a felony of the first degree
when the person engages in sexual
intercourse with a complainant: ... (5)
Who suffers from a mental disability
which renders the complainant incapable
of consent." 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3121(a)(5). Furthermore,
if the legislature intended this
exception to apply to all students, it could
have used the term "student" like it did in
Section 3124.2(a.2) pertaining to institutional
sexual assault. Section 3124.2(a.2)(1)
provides:

<B22>A person who is a volunteer or an employee
of a school or any other person
who has direct contact with a student at
a school commits a felony of the third
degree when he engages in sexual intercourse,
deviate sexual intercourse or indecent
contact with a <EMB>student</EMB> of the
school.

<P00>18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3124.2(a.2)(1) (emphasis added).

<P20>This is further demonstrated by the currently
proposed legislation in House Bill
No. 1614 of 2023, which would amend Section
5551 of the Judicial Code's enumerated
exceptions. The proposed legislation
would add Section 5551(a)(8) to the Judicial
Code, which would include:

<B22>An offense under any of the following
provisions of 18 Pa.C.S., or a conspiracy
or solicitation to commit an offense under
any of the following provisions of 18
Pa.C.S. if the offense results from the
conspiracy or solicitation, <EMB>if the victim
is a nonverbal care-dependent person</EMB>
at the time of the offense.

<P00>House Bill No. 1614 of 2023 (emphasis
added).<fnr3> This section goes on to list numerous
<Page 353>
criminal offenses, including offenses
related to sexual abuse. <EM>Id.</EM> A "nonverbal
care-dependent person" under this section
is

<B22>an individual who is 18 years of age or
older who, due to physical or cognitive
disability or impairment, requires assistance
to meet the individual's needs for
food, shelter, clothing, personal care or
health care and has significantly subaverage
general intellectual functioning
that is accompanied by significant limitations
in the adaptive function of communication.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> This proposed legislation illustrates
that the legislature is aware students who
are over age 18, but care-dependent, such
as S.W., are not currently entitled to the
Section 8542(b)(9) and Section 5551(7) of
the Judicial Code's exceptions to governmental
immunity. The fact that this section
is being proposed separately adds credence
to the notion that such individuals,
when over the age of 18, are not entitled to
the immunity exception in Sections
8542(b)(9) and 5551(7) of the Judicial Code.

<P20>It is only when the words of a statute
are not "explicit" that we may turn to the
General Assembly's intention and consider
other matters such as the circumstances
under which the law was enacted, the
wrong to be remedied, the object to be
attained, or the consequences of a particular
interpretation. <EM>See</EM> 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1921.
Indeed, consideration of these factors
would lead me to conclude that a victim,
such as S.W. here, should receive the protections
afforded by Sections 8542(b)(9)
and 5551(7) of the Judicial Code. However,
I recognize that we are bound by the clear
and express language of Sections

8542(b)(9) and 5551(7) of the Judicial Code.
Section 8542(b)(9) of the Judicial Code
clearly provides its exception is applicable
only to the offenses enumerated in Section
5551(7) of the Judicial Code, and this section
limits those enumerated offenses to
crimes involving victims who were under
the age of 18 at the time of the offenses.
As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted
in <EM>Winston v. Moore,</EM> 244 Pa. 447, 91 A.
520 (1914),

<B22>if it were our duty to make the law, no
doubt some of its provisions would be
written differently; but we cannot declare
an act void because in some respects
it may not meet the approval of
our judgment, or because there may be
difference of opinion as to its wisdom
upon grounds of public policy. Questions
of this character are for the Legislature
and not for the courts.

abuse exception to immunity under the
Tort Claims Act if the conduct at issue rises
to the level of one of the sexual offenses

the [West's] allegations against the [District]
fall within Section 8542(b)(9) and
may encompass one or more offenses under
Section 5551(7) such as institutional
sexual assault under 18 Pa.C.S.[] &sect; 3124.2.
The [District's] preliminary objections
based on governmental immunity were
properly denied.

<P00>Trial Court's 1925(a) opinion, filed 2/21/2023.

<fnt6> The trial court's order overruling the District's
preliminary objection is immediately
appealable to this Court as a collateral order.
<EM>See</EM> Pa.R.A.P. 313; <EM>Brooks v. Ewing Cole, Inc.,</EM>
668 Pa. 298, 259 A.3d 359, 374 (2021) (adverse
orders on the issue of governmental
immunity are immediately reviewable as collateral
orders because the entitlement is an
immunity from suit rather than a mere defense
to liability; and like an absolute immunity,
it is effectively lost if a case is erroneously

<fnt7> In reviewing a trial court's order sustaining
or overruling preliminary objections, our "review

<P00>Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 14 (emphasis added).

<fnt2> Unpublished decisions of the Superior
Court filed after May 1, 2019, may be cited
for their persuasive value. Pa.R.A.P. 126(b)(1).

<fnt3> The argument raised is one of statutory construction.
As noted above, interpreting the
sexual abuse exception involves reading Section
8542(b)(9) of the Tort Claims Act <EM>in pari
materia</EM> with Section 5551(7) of the Judicial
Code, which it cross-references. The appellants
in <EM>City of Philadelphia</EM> argued that the
focus should be on the word <EM>conduct</EM> in Section
8542(b)(9). According to the petition for
allocatur:

<B22>The critical term here in Section 8542(b)(9)
is the word <EMBI>conduct.</EMBI> Section 8542(b)(9)
waives immunity for <EMBI>conduct</EMBI> that constitutes
one of nine (9) separate criminal offenses
that are enumerated in 42 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 5551(7). The term <EMBI>conduct</EMBI> is key. The
Crimes Code defines the word "<EMBI>conduct</EMBI>" as
"[a]n action or omission and its accompanying
state of mind, or, where relevant, a
series of acts or omissions." 18 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 103. Thus, "<EMBI>conduct</EMBI>" as that term is used
in the Crimes Code has nothing to do with
the age of the alleged victim. Nor does
"<EMBI>conduct</EMBI>" concern facts implicating the
statute of limitations or the age of the alleged
victim. Thus, a plain reading of Section
8542(b)(9) leads to one and only one
conclusion: whether the waiver of sovereign
immunity applies depends on whether the
action(s) or omission(s) of the actor and his
or her accompanying state of mind amount
to one of the nine offenses enumerated in
Section 5551(7). If the answer is yes, then
sovereign immunity is in applicable. (Emphasis
in original.)

<fnt1> West is S.W.'s mother and court-appointed
guardian. R.R. at 7a.

<fnt2> Earlier this year, this Court <EM>en banc,</EM> in its
original jurisdiction, held that the Department
of Education's attempt to extend the age of a
student receiving special education services
until the student's 22nd birthday was an unlawful
regulation. <EM>See Pa. Sch. Bds. Ass'n, Inc.
v. Mumin,</EM> 317 A.3d 1077 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2024).
However, the Department has appealed by
right to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and
this question remains unresolved. <EM>See Pa. Sch.
Bds. Ass'n, Inc. v. Mumin</EM> (Pa., No. 39 MAP
2024). Nevertheless, for purposes of this writing,
I will treat the maximum age of receiving
education as 21.

<fnt3> While I recognize the importance of governmental
immunity and that the legislature already
carved out the sexual abuse exception,
which is laudable, I would be remiss if I did
not point out that the proposed legislation
already forecasts future litigation. The law
currently allows for students to receive public
education to age 21, maybe age 22, <EM>see</EM> footnote
2 <EM>supra.</EM> It appears the legislature has
plans to include disabled individuals (nonverbal
care-dependent persons) who are in
school but have reached age 18 for purposes
of the sexual abuse exception. A gap remains,
however, about what happens to those students
who are ages 18 to 21 who may not fall
under the proposed definition of "nonverbal
care-dependent person." It is certainly the
legislative body's prerogative of whether it
wants students of age 18 to 21 to be treated
the same for immunity purposes, but I ask the
legislature to consider addressing this gap
head on. The bill, if it becomes law, will
inevitably put this Court in the position of
trying to determine whether it was the legislature's
intent to not also cover students ages 18
to 21 who do not meet the definition of "non-verbal
care-dependent person." A logical conclusion
would be that the legislature intends
for them to not fall within the sexual abuse
exception because the legislature went out of
its way to amend the law to include and
define "nonverbal care-dependent person(s)."
We would say, "if it wanted to include all
students, it could have said so." I could also
see how the Court would be faced with needing
to interpret the statute in a manner that
would not violate the Constitution. Is there a
reason that two classmates, one who turned
18 at the beginning of her senior year and one
who was still only 17, should be treated differently,
i.e., not "equally" for purposes of falling
within the sexual abuse exception? These
students, simply by turning 18, lose any possible
entitlement to the benefit of the exception
should they be subject to sexual abuse during
their remaining time in the public schools.
While I commend our legislature for recognizing
the need to further extend the sexual
abuse exception, my concern remains that not
all the Commonwealth's public school students
would be entitled to the benefit of this
exception. Many of the students in our public
schools are over the age of 18, including a
portion of our high school seniors who turn
18 during their final school year. For others,
they may be over 18 and not have advanced
because of personal challenges, yet do not
meet the definition of "nonverbal care-dependent
person." For instance, consider a student
who faces family trauma, perhaps loses
both parents to a car accident, and he gets
held back for one grade such that he is 19 his
senior year. Are the newly minted 18-year-old
and the held-back 19-year-old not also vulnerable
and worthy of falling within the sexual
abuse immunity exception? While the result
of this case is tragic for S.W. and her loved
ones, I do credit the legislature for creating
this exception in the first place and for responding
to the public need in the wake of
sexual abuse that has been brought to light. I
also acknowledge that in writing laws, it is
impossible at times to see the gaps in the law
until life applies. It is for this reason that I
humbly raise these points and recognize that
the legislative branch not the judicial branch
ultimately determines policies.

<P20>Before this Court is the appeal of the
School District of the City of Erie (School
District) from the December 28, 2023 Order
of the Court of Common Pleas of Erie
County (common pleas) that granted declaratory
relief to Perseus House Charter
School of Excellence, Inc. (Charter School)
and held that the term of Charter School's
renewed charter began on the date it was
reauthorized, rather than the date Charter
School's prior charter expired. Also before
the Court is Charter School's Application
to Quash School District's Appeal (Application),
in which Charter School argues
School District did not preserve any issues
for appellate review because it did not file
Post-Trial Motions in accordance with
Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure (Civil
Rule) 227.1(g), Pa.R.Civ.P. 227.1(g).
Upon review, we are constrained by the
Supreme Court decision in <EM>Motorists Mutual
Insurance Company v. Pinkerton,</EM>
574 Pa. 333, 830 A.2d 958 (2003), to grant
the Application and dismiss School District's
appeal.

<HN20><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<P20>Charter School commenced this matter
in common pleas as a declaratory judgment
action against School District. (Reproduced
Record (R.R.) at 4a-8a, 21a.) The
parties filed a stipulation of facts (Stipulation)
for common pleas to use "as the basis
for [common pleas]' determination of this
Declaratory Judgment Action." (<EM>Id.</EM> at 27a-39a.)
Common pleas set forth those facts,
and the issues raised in Charter School's
<Page 356>
complaint, in its December 28, 2023 opinion,
as follows.

<B22>[Charter School] is a Pennsylvania non-profit
organization that holds a charter
issued by [School District] to operate a
charter school pursuant to the Pennsylvania
Charter School Law [(CSL)<fnr1>]....
[Charter School's] charter commenced
on July 1, 2016[,] and was approved for a
five-year period &mdash; through June 30, 2021.
By letter dated June 18, 2020, [Charter
School] advised [] School District that it
sought renewal of its charter. However,
despite the diligent efforts of both parties,
the renewal process was not completed
prior to the expiration date for
the original charter.

<B22>During the renewal process, the parties
agreed to an approval plan requiring
[Charter School] to[:] (1) compile metrics
related to measured and targeted
populations; (2) set academic improvement
goals of an annual 10% increase in
Classroom Diagnostic Tool scores for
the measured population and a [55] point
increase in Math and Reading Inventory
scores for at least 70% of the measured
population; and (3) set a target attendance
rate of 84%. Additionally, the parties
recognized that the charter would
not be renewed prior to the date of its
expiration. [] School District took the
position that the renewal would be retroactive
and would be effective as of July 1,
202[1]. [Charter School] contended that
the renewal would be effective as of the
date the renewal was approved and
signed. The parties agreed to all other
terms of the renewal and further agreed
to litigate the effective date of the charter's
renewal at a later date. [] School
District approved the renewal of the
charter and accompanying improvement
plan on March 9, 2022 &mdash; eight months
after the expiration date of the original
charter. [Charter School] filed this declaratory
judgment action on October
12, 2022. [] School District filed a timely
answer on November 4, 2022. Both parties
filed briefs in support of their respective
positions and in reply to the
opposing party's brief. Oral argument on
the matter was held May 12, 2023[,] at
which time both parties were represented
by their counsel.

<P00>(Common pleas' Opinion (Op.) at 1-3 (citations
omitted).)

<P20>Common pleas concluded that its review
of Charter School's complaint was guided
by Section 7532 of the Declaratory Judgments
Act (DJA), 43 Pa.C.S. &sect; 7532, which,
by "its plain meaning, does not impose any
specific requirements on courts seeking to
enter declaratory judgment orders." (<EM>Id.</EM> at
3.) Instead, common pleas indicated that
section "`affords the courts broad discretion
in crafting declaratory judgment orders
by permitting such orders to be either
affirmative or negative in form and
effect.' <EM>National Cas. Co. v. Kinney,</EM> 90
A.3d 747, 754 (Pa. Super. 2014) (internal
citations and quotations omitted)." (<EM>Id.</EM>)

<P20>On the merits, common pleas explained
the only issue before it was "whether the
renewal charter for [Charter School] [wa]s
effective as of the date the renewal charter
was executed ([Charter School]'s position)
or whether the effective date [wa]s made
retroactive to the day after the original
charter expired (School District's position)."
(<EM>Id.</EM> at 3.) This issue, common pleas
held, is not directly addressed in the CSL.
Common pleas cited, as the relevant statutory
provision, Section 1720-A(a) of the
CSL, which provides, in pertinent part, as
follows:
<Page 357>

<B22>Except as otherwise provided in subsection
(b), the charter shall be for a period
of no less than three (3) nor more than
five (5) years and may be renewed for
five (5)[-]year periods <EMB>upon reauthorization</EMB>
by the local board of school directors
of a school district or the appeal
board.

<P00>24 P.S. &sect; 17-1720-A(a) (emphasis added).
Citing Section 1921(b) of the Statutory
Construction Act of 1972 (Statutory Construction
Act),<fnr2> 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1921(b), and
the language "upon reauthorization" from
Section 1720-A(a) of the CSL, common
pleas held that the common understanding
of this language "would be that the five-year
renewal term would commence when
the decision to reauthorize the charter was
approved and finalized," and "nothing in
the language of the [CSL] state[s] that any
authorizations are made effective retroactively."
(Common pleas' Op. at 6.) And, in
this case, that date would be March 9,
2022. Common pleas also noted that, Section
1729-A(f) of the CSL, 24 P.S. &sect; 17-1729-A(f),
while not directly applicable, reflected
that a charter school's charter remains
in effect until there is a final disposition
from the State Charter School Appeal
Board (CAB), meaning that a "renewal
period cannot begin until the previous
charter had expired or ended." (<EM>Id.</EM>)

<P20>Common pleas was persuaded by Charter
School's practical arguments, that "the
renewal agreement, which was signed on
March 9, 2022, sets forth target population
and attendance goals as well as academic
achievement progress goals, which must be
met year-over-year," and if the charter
renewal was made retroactive, Charter
School "would have operated for nearly an
entire school year without having known
exactly what those target metrics were
and would not have had the ability to work
toward meeting those specific targets."
(<EM>Id.</EM>) This was important, according to
common pleas, because "failure to meet
performance standards set forth in a charter
document is grounds for termination of
a charter and therefore of substantial significance
to the [C]harter [S]chool's administration.
<EM>See, e.g., Graystone Acad</EM>[.]
<EM>Charter Sch. v. Coatesville Area Sch. Dist.,</EM>
99 A.3d 125 (Pa. C[mwlth]. 2014)." (<EM>Id.</EM> at
7.) Common pleas was similarly persuaded
that given the lack of concrete deadlines
for the review of renewal application, a
charter school could end up with a charter
renewed for a period of less than five
years, in contravention of the CSL's plain
language, if the approval was made retroactive.
(<EM>Id.</EM>)

<P20>Common pleas found School District's
reliance on the CAB's decisions in <EM>Fell v.
Carbondale Area School District,</EM> CAB
Docket Nos. 2017-02 & 2022-04, filed, respectively,
November 22, 2017, and December
21, 2022, to be misplaced. While
those decisions supported the conclusion
"that charters renew in straightforward
five[-]year increments," no deference was
required because the timing of the renewal
application, decision, and effective date of
the renewal were not addressed in any of
those cases. (<EM>Id.</EM> at 8.) Instead, common
pleas noted that the <EM>Fell</EM> decisions involved
a situation where the school district involved
repeatedly abandoned its decisions
denying a renewal, which had been done
without hearings, once the charter school
filed an appeal. (<EM>Id.</EM>)

<P20>Ultimately, common pleas concluded
that

<B22>[o]n balance ... the plain language of
the statute provides for a five-year renewal
term starting on the date the
<Page 358>
charter application is reauthorized, that
the statute does not provide for the
making [of] the effective date of a charter's
renewal retroactive, and that the
practicalities and equities of the time
needed to review and negotiate renewal
applications require that the effective
date must be the date of approval, not a
retroactive date.

<P00>(<EM>Id.</EM> at 9.)

<P20>School District filed a notice of appeal to
this Court on January 11, 2024, and, at the
direction of common pleas, a Concise
Statement of Errors Complained of on Appeal
(Statement) pursuant to Pennsylvania
Rule of Appellate Procedure (Appellate
Rule) 1925(b), Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). In the
Statement, School District argued common
pleas erred in finding that the renewed
charter commenced on the date it was
reauthorized and signed, rather than immediately
following the expiration of the
prior charter. Common pleas issued a February
5, 2024 order in lieu of an opinion
under Appellate Rule 1925(a), indicating
its December 28, 2023 opinion fully addressed
the issues raised in the Statement.

<P20>On February 13, 2024, Charter School
filed the Application, requesting that this
Court quash School District's appeal because
School District had not, prior to
filing its notice of appeal, filed post-trial
motions, thereby waiving all issues for appellate
review. School District filed an answer
to the Application, and Charter
School was granted permission to file a sur
reply brief (Reply). Following telephonic
argument on the Application, the Court
directed that the Application be listed with
the merits of the appeal. (May 17, 2024
Order.)

<HN20><EMB>II. THE APPLICATION</EMB>

<CN><EM>A. Parties' Arguments</EM>

<P20>Charter School argues School District
has waived all issues on appeal by not
filing post-trial motions. Citing Civil Rule
227.1, <EM>Pinkerton,</EM> and other cases, Charter
School states post-trial motions are required
in all civil cases, including declaratory
judgment actions, where a trial or
non-jury trial is held, which includes those
that are submitted for decision on a stipulation
of facts. This conclusion is also supported
by <EM>McCormick v. Northeastern
Bank of Pennsylvania,</EM> 522 Pa. 251, 561
A.2d 328 (1989), Charter School asserts.
Here, Charter School argues, the parties
submitted the Stipulation and agreed to
have the declaratory judgment action be
decided on those stipulated facts, thereby
implicating Civil Rule 227.1.

<P20>In its Answer, School District contends
that <EM>Pinkerton's</EM> requirement for post-trial
motions is not clearly applicable here because
such procedure applies only to common
pleas court orders issued following a
trial. School District avers the present action
does not contain the hallmarks of trial
since no documentary evidence was offered
or admitted and no witnesses testified before
common pleas. Rather, School District
describes the procedural posture of this
case as more akin to a grant of summary
judgment or judgment on the pleadings,
which, according to the Comment to Civil
Rule 227.1(g), does not require post-trial
motions.

<P20>School District notes that our Supreme
Court has held that "to warrant the
heavy consequence of waiver," the applicability
of Civil Rule 227.1 "should be apparent
upon its face or, failing that, in clear
decisional law construing the Rule." <EM>Newman
Dev. Grp. of Pottstown, LLC v. Genuardi's
Fam. Mkts., Inc.,</EM> 617 Pa. 265, 52
A.3d 1233, 1247 (2012). In addition, courts
should also ask whether "practicing attorneys
would reasonably expect a post-trial
motion to be necessary" in the particular
situation. <EM>G&G Invs., LLC v. Phillips Simmons</EM>
<Page 359>
<EM>Real Est. Holdings, LLC,</EM> 183 A.3d
472, 477 (Pa. Super. 2018). School District
contends that none of these elements are
present here. For further support, School
District relies on two decisions from our
Superior Court, <EM>Palladino v. Dunn,</EM> 361
Pa.Super. 99, 521 A.2d 946 (1987), and
<EM>Lenhart v. Travelers Insurance Company,</EM>
408 Pa.Super. 1, 596 A.2d 162 (1991).

<P20>School District also contends that post-trial
motions were not required because
this case was an appeal from the final
adjudication or determination of a local
agency that is exempt under Civil Rule
227.1(g) ("A motion for post-trial relief
may not be filed in an appeal from the
final adjudication or determination of a
local agency or a Commonwealth agency
as to which jurisdiction is vested in the
courts of common pleas."). School District
notes that charter decisions are local agency
adjudications and the CAB's exclusive
jurisdiction does not extend to a decision
to grant a charter renewal, thereby vesting
jurisdiction in the common pleas court.
Further, School District points out that the
CSL provides no mechanism for direct appeal
of the grant of a charter on terms a
charter school deems unsatisfactory and
that it must seek relief from the common
pleas court. Therefore, School District avers,
the fact that Charter School's action
was labeled a complaint seeking declaratory
relief does not change the fact that it
was dissatisfied with an agency decision
and sought review from the common pleas
court.

<P20>In its Reply, Charter School reiterates
that <EM>Pinkerton</EM> is controlling and is clear
decisional law requiring post-trial motions
in declaratory judgment cases like the one
here. Charter School indicates <EM>Pinkerton</EM>
involved, as here, stipulations of fact,
which the Supreme Court, citing the Explanatory
Comment to Civil Rule 1038.1,
Pa.R.Civ.P. 1038.1, described as being akin
to a "nonjury trial with respect to the
decision, post-trial practice and appeal."
830 A.2d at 964. Charter School notes that
School District acknowledges the clear requirements
of <EM>Pinkerton</EM> but proceeds to
set forth policy factors which it believes
supply reasons for a departure from these
requirements. Charter School also argues
<EM>Palladino</EM> and <EM>Lenhart</EM> are distinguishable
and pre-date <EM>Pinkerton</EM> and that School
District's reliance on Civil Rule 227.1(g) is
misplaced given the parties' treatment of
this case before common pleas as a complaint
seeking declaratory relief.

<CN><EM>B. Discussion</EM>

<P20>Civil Rule 227.1, and the <EM>Comment</EM>
immediately following it, provide, in pertinent
part, as follows:

<B22>(c) Post-trial motions <EMB>shall be filed
within ten days after</EMB>

<B22>(1) verdict, discharge of the jury because
of inability to agree, or nonsuit in the
case of a jury trial; or

<B22>(2) notice of nonsuit or <EMB>the filing of the
decision in the case of a trial without

LLC v. Cambria Cnty. Transit Auth.,</EM> 162
A.3d 549, 554 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2017).

<P20>In <EM>Pinkerton</EM> and <EM>Chalkey,</EM> our Supreme
Court explained that it specifically adopted
Civil Rules 227.1 through 227.4 in 1984 in
order to establish uniform procedures for
post-trial relief in actions at law and equity.
<EM>See Pinkerton,</EM> 830 A.2d at 963-64;
<EM>Chalkey,</EM> 805 A.2d at 496 n.13. The Supreme
Court, as well as this Court and the
Superior Court, have required the filing of
post-trial motions in cases submitted to
common pleas courts on stipulated facts,
which, per Civil Rule 1038.1, are treated
like non-jury trials. <EM>See Pinkerton,</EM> 830
A.2d at 963-64; <EM>McCormick,</EM> 561 A.2d at
329-30; <EM>Goshen Valley III Condo. Ass'n v.

v. Meyer,</EM> 832 A.2d 477, 478-79 (Pa. Super.
2003).

<P20>Our Supreme Court has imposed
the post-trial motion requirement of Civil
Rule 227.1 to declaratory judgment actions
that are not decided on pre-trial motions.
<EM>See Pinkerton,</EM> 830 A.2d at 963-64; <EM>Chalkey,</EM>
805 A.2d at 496 n.13. As our Supreme
Court explained in <EM>Pinkerton,</EM>

<B22>[t]he venerable purpose of the post-trial
motion procedure is to permit the trial
court to correct its own errors before
appellate review is commenced.[] Pa.
R.Civ.P. 227.1 (Explanatory Comment &mdash;
1995, I.b). Allowing parties to bypass
such procedures in declaratory judgment
actions would deprive the trial
court of this critical gatekeeping function,
while doing little to expedite appellate
review. In addition, excepting declaratory
judgment orders from the
plain language of [Civil] Rule 227.1
would unnecessarily complicate application
of that rule and result in further
confusion among litigants and the lower
courts. <EMB>Accordingly, we hold that post-trial
declaratory judgment orders, just
like other post-trial orders, are subject
to the post-trial motion procedures in
[Civil] Rule 227.1.</EMB>

<P00>830 A.2d at 964 (footnote omitted) (emphasis
added). Thus, while the Supreme Court
has held that declaratory judgment actions
brought under the DJA resolved on pre-trial
orders are immediately appealable,
the Court rejected the same treatment for
those DJA matters that are resolved following
a jury or non-jury trial, including
those resolved based on stipulated facts
submitted by the parties. <EM>Id.</EM> at 963-64.

<P20>Here, the parties agreed to have
the issue of when the renewed charter
began resolved via a declaratory judgment
action filed with common pleas. (Stipulation
&para; 9, R.R. at 28a (stipulating that they
"reserved for decision through a declaratory
judgment proceeding the issue of the
date of commencement of a new charter
when the renewal process extends beyond
the end date of the prior charter").) Charter
School filed the complaint, and School
District responded with an answer. <EMB>They
filed the Stipulation,</EMB> setting forth the
facts upon which common pleas could resolve
the complaint. (R.R. at 27a-39a.) <EMB>Neither
party filed pre-trial motions for
judgment on the pleadings or summary</EMB>
<Page 361>
<EMB>judgment.</EMB> Rather, they submitted briefs
and presented oral argument to common
pleas, <EMB>after which common pleas issued
its decision on the declaratory judgment
action based on those arguments and
the stipulated facts.</EMB> Pursuant to Civil
Rule 1038.1 and precedent, including <EM>Pinkerton,</EM>
this declaratory judgment matter
was resolved via a non-jury trial, and Civil
Rule 227.1 and precedent, including <EM>Pinkerton,
Chalkey,</EM> and <EM>McCormick,</EM> require
that post-trial motions be filed within 10
days of common pleas' decision to preserve
any issues for appellate review. Our Supreme
Court has explained that issue preservation
"play[s] an important role in"
"`the preservation of consistency and predictability
in the operation of our appellate
process,'" in which the Supreme Court
"`has a strong interest.'" <EM>Newman Dev.
Grp.,</EM> 52 A.3d at 1246 (quoting <EM>Samuel-Bassett
v. Kia Motors Am., Inc.,</EM> 613 Pa.
371, 34 A.3d 1, 49 (2011)).

<P20>School District's arguments as to why
Civil Rule 227.1 should not apply here are
not persuasive. First, while the Court acknowledges
the potential harshness of the
application of Civil Rule 227.1, <EM>Pinkerton,
Chalkey,</EM> and <EM>McCormick</EM> represent clear
decisional law that supports the application
of that rule in situations where, as here,
the parties present a court of common
pleas a stipulation of facts upon which that
court issues a decision resolving a declaratory
judgment action on those facts and
argument, rather than on pre-trial motions.
Second, we agree with Charter
School that <EM>Palladino</EM> and <EM>Lenhart,</EM> which
involved declaratory judgment actions in
which the Superior Court did not quash
the appeals due to the failure to file post-trial
motions, do not require a different
result.<fnr3> Importantly, those <EMB>Superior Court</EMB>
decisions <EMB>pre-date</EMB> the <EMB>Supreme Court's</EMB>
decisions in <EM>Pinkerton</EM> and <EM>Chalkey,</EM> and
their progeny, which reflect clear decisional
law of the <EMB>mandatory</EMB> application of
Civil Rule 227.1 under these circumstances.
Additionally, in declining to quash
in <EM>Lenhart,</EM> the Superior Court observed
that "[t]he parties <EMB>did not submit</EMB> the
action on <EMB>an agreed statement of facts</EMB>
and then request the court to render judgment,"
and "[n]o evidence or findings of
fact were introduced or presented [before
the common pleas court,]" 596 A.2d at 164
(emphasis added), which is unlike here.

<P20>Third, School District's contentions
that this matter was an appeal from a local
agency adjudication or in the nature of
motion for judgment on the pleadings, and,
therefore, no post-trial motions were required,
are not persuasive. It is undisputed
that the parties agreed to resolve the disputed
start date of the renewed charter via
a declaratory judgment action filed with
common pleas. The renewal of the charter,
including the improvement plan, was the
process of <EMB>negotiation</EMB> between School
District and Charter School, as reflected in
the March 9, 2022 resolution, which states
"this Charter constitutes a legally binding
agreement," (R.R. at 33a), not an agency
adjudication under the Local Agency Law,
2 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 551-555. As for School District's
other contention, no pre-trial motions
<Page 362>
were filed that would implicate the
exception set forth in the <EM>Comment</EM> to
Rule 227.1.

<P20>Fourth, and finally, School District's policy
arguments, which relate more to a
charter school's ability (or not) to challenge
or appeal conditions imposed upon a
granted renewal, are not implicated in this
matter. By the parties' agreement, the
only issue before common pleas was the
date upon which the renewed charter
would begin and does not implicate the
policy issues School District presents.

<P20>Ultimately, School District asserts that
"to warrant the heavy consequence of
waiver," the applicability of Civil Rule
227.1 "should be apparent upon its face or,
failing that, in clear decisional law construing
the Rule." <EM>Newman Dev. Grp.,</EM> 52 A.3d
at 1247. As discussed above, however, the
Supreme Court, as well as this Court and
the Superior Court, have rendered "clear
decisional law," <EM>id.,</EM> that requires the application
of Civil Rule 227.1 under these circumstances.
Under that precedent, we are
constrained to dismiss School District's appeal
because it did not file post-trial motions
and, therefore, did not preserve any
issues for appellate review. Pa.R.Civ.P.
227.1(b)(2); <EM>Chalkey,</EM> 805 A.2d at 497; <EM>Coal
Tubin' PA, LLC,</EM> 162 A.3d at 554. Accordingly,
we grant the Application.<fnr4>

<HN20><EMB>III. CONCLUSION</EMB>

<P20>For the foregoing reasons, we are constrained
to grant Charter School's Application
and dismiss School District's appeal
pursuant to Civil Rule 227.1 and precedent
requiring the filing of post-trial motions in
declaratory judgment actions where the
case is submitted on stipulations of fact.
The exceptions to this mandatory requirement,
set forth in Civil Rule 227.1(g) and
the <EM>Comment</EM> accompanying these rules,
are not applicable here, where this was not
an appeal from a local agency decision and
the declaratory judgment complaint was
not resolved on pre-trial motions.

<CN><EMBU>ORDER</EMBU>

<P20><EMB>NOW,</EMB> November 7, 2024, Perseus
House Charter School of Excellence, Inc.'s

<FN>
<fnt1> Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, <EM>as amended,</EM>
added by the Act of June 19, 1997, P.L. 225,
24 P.S. &sect;&sect; 17-1701-A-17-1751-A.

<fnt2> Section 1921(b) of the Statutory Construction

&sect; 1921(b).

<fnt3> In <EM>Palladino,</EM> a declaratory judgment action
involving an insurance coverage dispute, the
Superior Court refused to quash an appeal for
filing untimely post-trial motions, noting that
the order from which the appeal was taken
contained no findings of fact, conclusions of

anything but a final order or required exceptions
to preserve a right to appeal. 521 A.2d at
948. In <EM>Lenhart,</EM> a motor vehicle liability case
involving the propriety of an arbitration
award, the Superior Court refused to quash
an appeal for failure to file post-trial motions,

a question of law that was determined solely
on the record and briefs. 596 A.2d at 163-64.

<fnt4> While the order directing the Application to

<P20>OPINION BY <dgn>SENIOR JUDGE</dgn>
<author>LEADBETTER</author>.
[MT]
<P20>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
Department of Transportation, Bureau of
Driver Licensing, appeals from an order
of the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver
County sustaining the statutory appeal of
Licensee, Jesse Paul Charko, from the
Department's imposition of an 18-month
suspension of his operating privilege for
refusing to submit to chemical testing pursuant
to Section 1547(b)(1)(ii) of the Vehicle
Code, 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1547(b)(1)(ii).<fnr1> We
affirm.

<P20>In June 2023, the trial court conducted a
<EM>de novo</EM> hearing at which Harmony Township
police officer Juan Villagomez, Licensee,
and two witnesses on behalf of Licensee
testified. In addition, one exhibit was
accepted into evidence: Commonwealth
Exhibit 1 (the Department's packet of supporting
documentation). The sole issue on
appeal is whether Officer Villagomez had
reasonable grounds to believe that Licensee
had been operating or in actual physical
control of the movement of a vehicle
<Page 364>
while in violation of Section 3802 of the
Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3802 (i.e., while
driving under the influence [DUI]), when
the officer requested that Licensee submit
to chemical testing.<fnr2>

<P20>The trial court accepted as credible
Licensee's narrative as to what occurred,
noting that Licensee's account, largely,
was corroborated by Officer Villagomez's
testimony and official reports.<fnr3> Mindful of
the foregoing, the pertinent findings of
fact are as follows. At approximately 2:30
a.m. on December 3, 2021, Officer Villagomez
responded to a complaint of loud music
in Ambridge, Pennsylvania. The source
was the radio in a 2011 GMC truck, parked
in front of Licensee's residence with its
engine running and the transmission in
Park. Officer Villagomez found Licensee
lying flat in the fully reclined driver's seat,
either asleep or unconscious. After unsuccessfully
trying to rouse him, an assisting
police officer opened the passenger door,
reached inside, and turned off the ignition.
When Officer Villagomez opened the driver's
side door and identified himself, Licensee
remained unresponsive. Officer Villagomez
detected an odor of alcohol and
saw a bottle of beer in the center cup
holder. After some additional nudging, Licensee
stated "I'm awake." Nov. 22, 2023
Trial Ct. Op. at 3. At that time, the officers
noted Licensee's slurred speech, watery
blood shot eyes, and slow movements. As
to whether Licensee had been drinking, he
acknowledged that he had four beers at
the American Legion. After Licensee refused
to submit to field sobriety tests,
Officer Villagomez placed him under arrest
and read him the DL-26B form verbatim.
Licensee refused to submit to chemical
testing.

<P20>During the traffic stop, Licensee continually
requested that the officers contact
the commander of the American Legion to
confirm that someone had given Licensee a
ride home and that someone else had driven
his truck back. <EM>Id.</EM> at 4. Neither officer
did so. When the officers asked Licensee
why he was found asleep in the driver's
<Page 365>
seat of his truck with the radio on and the
engine running, he stated that he lived in
the building in front of where his truck
was parked and that the building's heat
was not working as the result of a fire. <EM>Id.</EM>
Although Officer Villagomez testified that
he did not recall whether Licensee said
that he had been inside the building before
they arrived, the officer acknowledged that
Licensee "made comments saying he is
running a generator to run his electric, but
there is no power or anything like that in
the [building] itself." June 22, 2023 Hearing,
Notes of Testimony (N.T.) at 24; Reproduced
Record (R.R.) at 48a. Based on
Officer Villagomez's testimony on rebuttal
that he later confirmed with the code enforcement
officer that the building was
uninhabitable, the trial court found that
Licensee "did, in fact, tell the officers that
night that he was sleeping in his [truck]
due to the lack of heat in his home." Nov.
22, 2023 Trial Ct. Op. at 4 n.15. In support,
the trial court referenced Officer Villagomez's
testimony that even though he did
not confirm the building's uninhabitability
until later, he could tell its condition by
how it appeared that night. <EM>Id.</EM> at 5 n.16.

<P20>As stated, the sole issue on appeal
is whether Officer Villagomez had reasonable
grounds to believe that Licensee had
been operating or in actual physical control
of the movement of a vehicle while
intoxicated when the officer requested that
Licensee submit to chemical testing.
Whether reasonable grounds exist is a
question of law subject to our plenary review.
<EM>Banner v. Dep't of Transp., Bureau
of Driver Licensing,</EM> 558 Pa. 439, 447, 737
A.2d 1203, 1206 (1999). More specifically,
our role is to review the trial court's findings
of fact and determine whether, as a
matter of law, they support the trial
court's determination that Officer Villagomez
lacked reasonable grounds. In so doing,
we must view the evidence in a light
most favorable to Licensee as the party
who prevailed before the trial court. <EM>Reinhart
v. Dep't of Transp., Bureau of Driver
Licensing,</EM> 954 A.2d 761, 765-66 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 2008).

<CN><EMB>I.</EMB>

<P20>Our Supreme Court recently reversed
this Court's decision in <EM>Bold v. Department
of Transportation, Bureau of Driver
Licensing,</EM> 285 A.3d 970 (Pa. Cmwlth.
2022) (<EM>Bold I</EM>), <EM>rev'd,</EM> ___ Pa. ___, 320
A.3d 1185 (2024) (<EM>Bold II</EM>), thereby clarifying
the test for reasonable grounds to
apply to motorists who are found in vehicles
but not observed driving. In <EM>Bold,</EM> the
police officer found the motorist parked
outside a bar in a mall parking lot, passed
out in the driver's seat, and slumped over
the wheel with the engine running and
headlights activated. The officer opened
the unlocked vehicle door, shut off the
engine, and woke up Bold. In addition to
the smell of alcohol on Bold's breath, Bold
had trouble producing his documentation,
could not follow instructions for field sobriety
testing, was unsteady on his feet and
argumentative, and refused chemical testing.
Concluding that the Department established
reasonable grounds even though
Bold was not driving, this Court in <EM>Bold I</EM>
reversed the trial court's order sustaining
his statutory appeal.

<P20>In reversing the trial court, this Court in
<EM>Bold I,</EM> 285 A.3d at 978-79, partially overruled
<EM>Solomon v. Department of Transportation,
Bureau of Driver Licensing,</EM> 966
A.2d 640 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2009). In <EM>Solomon,</EM>
the motorist was found asleep in the reclined
driver's seat of a vehicle located
across the street from a night club on a
cold and snowy night with the vehicle's
engine running. Mindful of the Supreme
Court's observation in <EM>Banner,</EM> 737 A.2d at
1207, that reasonable grounds required,
"at the very least, ... some objective evidence
that the motorist exercised control
<Page 366>
over the movement of the vehicle at the
time he was intoxicated[,]" this Court in
<EM>Solomon</EM> concluded that the Department
did not establish reasonable grounds because
it presented no objective evidence
indicating that Solomon had driven the
vehicle before the police's arrival.

<P20>In reversing this Court's decision in
<EM>Bold I,</EM> the Supreme Court in <EM>Bold II</EM>
revisited, <EM>inter alia,</EM> the application of the
<EM>Banner</EM> test for ascertaining reasonable
grounds in cases where motorists are
found in vehicles but not observed driving.
The Supreme Court emphasized that
"[t]he Vehicle Code's provisions pertaining
to DUI aim to deter one hazardous behavior
that imperils public safety and one
only: <EM>driving</EM> under the influence." <EM>Bold II,</EM>
320 A.3d at 1201 (emphasis in original). It
rejected what it characterized as this
Court's departure from a common-sense
understanding of the statute where we
held that the implied consent statute and,
by extension, the DUI statute itself, "applie[d]
even in the absence of anything
resembling actual driving." <EM>Id.</EM> In so doing,
the Supreme Court cited several cases,
including <EM>Solomon,</EM> 966 A.2d at 640, as
support for the proposition that

<B22>[t]he use of the word "actual" as well as
the definite article in "the movement" at
least suggest that the driver actually has
to have done something, that there was
an actual movement near in time to the
police encounter&mdash;or at least reasonable
grounds to suspect such actual movement.

<P00><EM>Bold II,</EM> 320 A.3d at 1193 n.47.<fnr4>

<P20>Accordingly, the Supreme Court in <EM>Bold
II</EM> confirmed the <EM>Banner</EM> test for reasonable
grounds as set forth in that 1999 case:

<B22>Reasonable grounds exist when a person
in the position of the police officer, viewing
the facts and circumstances as they
appeared at the time, could have concluded
that the motorist was operating
the vehicle while under the influence of
intoxicating liquor. In determining
whether an officer had reasonable
grounds to believe that a motorist was in
"actual physical control" of a vehicle, the
court must consider the totality of the
circumstances, including the location of
the vehicle, whether the engine was running
and whether there was other evidence
indicating that the motorist had
driven the vehicle at some point prior to
the arrival of the police.

<P00><EM>Bold II,</EM> 320 A.3d at 1201 (quoting <EM>Banner,</EM>
737 A.2d at 1207) (internal citations omitted).
The Court stated: "This test must be
applied in a fashion that honors the line we
cited `distinguish[ing] circumstances where
a motorist is driving his vehicle while under
the influence of alcohol, which the
statute is intended to prevent, and circumstances
where a motorist is physically
present in a motor vehicle after becoming
<Page 367>
intoxicated.'" <EM>Id.</EM> (quoting <EM>Banner,</EM> 737
A.2d at 1208).

<P20>In relying on <EM>Banner,</EM> the Supreme
Court in <EM>Bold II</EM> observed that the <EM>Banner</EM>
test has not been explicitly questioned
since its articulation and that, "in multiple
revisitations of the Vehicle Code's implied
consent and DUI statutes, the legislature
has never seen fit to amend the relevant
statutory language." <EM>Bold II,</EM> 320 A.3d at
1201. In addition, the Court emphasized
"the importance of allowing <EM>statutes,</EM> not
layers of case law, to determine outcomes
in matters of statutory interpretation." <EM>Id.</EM>
at 1191 (emphasis in original).

<CN><EMB>II.</EMB>

<P20>In the present case, the trial court
concluded that the information available to
Officer Villagomez when he requested that
Licensee submit to chemical testing fell
short of the minimum required evidence to
support reasonable grounds. Acknowledging
that it is irrelevant whether alternative
reasonable explanations exist as to
how a motorist came to be as he was
found,<fnr5> the trial court reasoned that an
"officer [nonetheless] must base his belief
on <EM>objective</EM> evidence." Nov. 22, 2023 Trial
Ct. Op. at 13 (emphasis in original). In
concluding that the evidence the Department
proffered fell short, the trial court
observed that the totality of evidence
known to Officer Villagomez on the night
in question included verifiable evidence
that someone had dropped off Licensee at
his residence and someone else had driven
his truck there,<fnr6> as well as evidence that
his residence was unhabitable. <EM>Id.</EM> The trial
court reasoned that the fact that Licensee
"was sleeping fully reclined in the driver
seat with the engine running" was insufficient
alone to reasonably conclude that he
was in "actual physical control" of the
truck. <EM>Id.</EM> at 14. The trial court emphasized
that the Department "provided no other
objective evidence indicating that [Licensee]
operated or was in actual physical
control of the movement of the vehicle at
some point prior to the arrival of the police."
<EM>Id.</EM> In addition, it noted that "[n]either
officer observed [Licensee] driving,
and no reports from any witnesses stated
that [he] was driving." <EM>Id.</EM> at 5.

<P20>We agree that the Department failed to
establish that Officer Villagomez had reasonable
grounds to believe that Licensee
had been operating or in actual physical
control of the movement of a vehicle while
intoxicated when he requested that Licensee
submit to chemical testing. Even
though the test for reasonable grounds has
been characterized as not very demanding
and an officer need not be correct in his
belief,<fnr7> the Department is still required to
present objective evidence that supports
such belief. <EM>Bold II,</EM> 320 A.3d at 1195 n.56.
There is no such objective evidence in the
present case.

<P20>As the trial court alluded, even though
Officer Villagomez did not have to believe
Licensee's account, the Department nonetheless
bore the burden of presenting
some objective evidence that Licensee exercised
control over the movement of the
truck while intoxicated. <EM>Banner,</EM> 737 A.2d
at 1207. Besides Licensee's presence in the
<Page 368>
driver's seat with the engine running, the
Department presented no other evidence
indicating that Licensee had driven the
truck before the officers' arrival.<fnr8> As the
Supreme Court observed, "there is an inescapable
fact-sensitivity to these cases."
<EM>Bold II,</EM> 320 A.3d at 1198. Accordingly,
based on the trial court's supported findings
of fact, we affirm.

<CN><EMBU>ORDER</EMBU>

<P20>AND NOW, this 19th day of November,
2024, the order of the Court of Common
Pleas of Beaver County is hereby AFFIRMED.
<FN>
<fnt1> Section 1547, commonly referred to as the
Implied Consent Law, permits chemical testing
of licensees under certain circumstances.
An 18-month suspension is warranted when a
licensee commits a second violation of Section
1547. 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1547(b)(1)(ii).

<fnt2> In pertinent part, Section 1547(a) of the
Vehicle Code provides:

<B42>Any person who drives, operates or is in
actual physical control of the movement of
a vehicle in this Commonwealth shall be
deemed to have given consent to one or
more chemical tests of breath or blood for
the purpose of determining the alcoholic
content of blood or the presence of a controlled
substance if a police officer has reasonable
grounds to believe the person to
have been driving, operating or in actual
physical control of the movement of a vehicle
in violation of section ... 3802 (relating
to driving under influence of alcohol or
controlled substance)[.]

<P00>75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1547(a). Even though the Department
included "driving" in its statement of
questions involved, it asserted in its Concise
Statement of Errors Complained of on Appeal
that it "sufficiently demonstrated that Officer
Villagomez had reasonable grounds ... to
conclude that [Licensee] was operating a motor
vehicle under the influence of alcohol
and/or a controlled substance." Oct. 16, 2023
Concise Statement at 2; Reproduced Record
(R.R.) at 125a. In addition, the trial court did
not conclude that Licensee was driving. <EM>See</EM>
Nov. 22, 2023 Trial Ct. Op. at 5 ("Neither
officer observed [Licensee] driving, and no
reports from any witnesses stated that [he]
was driving."). Accordingly, we approach this
case as one involving whether the motorist
was "operating or was in actual physical control
of the movement of a vehicle." <EM>See Bold v.
Dep't of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing,</EM>
___ Pa. ___, 320 A.3d 1185, 1191 n.32 (2024)
(<EM>Bold II</EM>) (where no one maintained and the
trial court did not find that the motorist drove
the vehicle, the Court focused on "operating
or in actual physical control of the movement"
of the vehicle).

<fnt3> The weight of the evidence is exclusively
within the purview of the fact finder, who is
free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence
and determine the credibility of witnesses.
<EM>Reinhart v. Dep't of Transp., Bureau of
Driver Licensing,</EM> 954 A.2d 761, 765 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 2008).

<fnt4> Notably, the Supreme Court in <EM>Bold II</EM> had
divergent judicial interpretations of the operative
statutes and how the language related to
reasonable grounds. In a concurring opinion,
Justice Dougherty agreed with the <EM>Bold II</EM>
Majority that "drive," "operate," and "actual
physical control of the movement of a vehicle"
all required a finding that the vehicle
moved while the motorist was impaired and
that, in the absence of such evidence, Bold
was entitled to relief. However, Justice
Dougherty disagreed that the terms were interchangeable.
<EM>Bold II,</EM> 320 A.3d at 1206-07.

<P20>In a dissenting opinion, Justice Mundy stated
that she "would hold that the triggering
word `operates(s)' does not require evidence
of movement but can be satisfied by exhibiting
power over one's automobile." <EM>Id.</EM> at
1210. She would have concluded that the
"facts establish that Bold had power over his
vehicle as it shows he was in command of the
machinery and management of his vehicle's
movement...." <EM>Id.</EM>

<fnt5> <EM>Gammer v. Dep't of Transp., Bureau of Driver
Licensing,</EM> 995 A.2d 380 (Pa. Cmwlth.
2010).

<fnt6> The fact that the officers chose not to seek
verification of Licensee's account constituted
a legitimate circumstance for the trial court to
consider in determining that the Department
failed to establish reasonable grounds.

<fnt7> <EM>Gammer,</EM> 995 A.2d at 384; <EM>Marone v. Dep't
of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing,</EM> 990
A.2d 1187, 1190 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2010).

<fnt8> The fact that two witnesses subsequently
testified on Licensee's behalf thereby bolstering
his account is somewhat irrelevant as to
whether a person in the position of Officer
Villagomez on the night in question could
have reasonably believed that Licensee was
operating his vehicle while DUI. However,
the trial court in finding Licensee to be credible
could have taken their testimony into account.
As noted, it is within the purview of the
trial court to weigh the evidence and determine
the credibility of the witnesses. <EM>Reinhart,</EM>
954 A.2d at 765.

[MJ]
<P20><dgn>Justice</dgn> <author>Lynch Prata</author>, for the Court.
[MT]
<P20>The plaintiff,<fnr1> Willie Gray (plaintiff), appeals
from an order denying his motion for
relief from an order granting a motion for
the entry of judgment in favor of the defendant,<fnr2>
the City of Providence (defendant).
This Court directed the parties to
appear and show cause why the issues
raised in this appeal should not be summarily
decided. After considering the parties'
written and oral submissions, and
carefully reviewing the record, we conclude
that cause has not been shown and
that this case may be decided without further
briefing or argument. For the reasons
set forth herein, we affirm the order of the
Superior Court.

<CN><EMB>Facts and Travel</EMB>

<P20>The plaintiffs filed their complaint on
September 3, 2020, for personal injuries
allegedly sustained in a fire at 110 Bowdoin
Street in Providence (the property)&mdash;
a multifamily residential property&mdash;on
January 12, 2018. Dexter Jackson (Jackson)
purportedly owned the property, and
plaintiffs claim Jackson's negligence
caused the fire. The complaint also alleged
that, from January 2015 through January
2018, defendant was aware of several city
housing code violations at the property,
including, but not limited to, a rat infestation
and dangerous electrical wiring.

<P20>On April 26, 2021, defendant served interrogatories
and requests for production
of documents on plaintiff. The defendant
submits that it did not receive a response
until November 22, 2021. In his answers to
the interrogatories, plaintiff provided, <EM>inter
alia,</EM> that he declined to elaborate on
his other criminal convictions in addition to
a domestic violence conviction in 2015; and
he frequently&mdash;and irrelevantly&mdash;referred
defendant to plaintiff's medical records in
retort to nonmedical questions. Unsatisfied
with his responses, defendant sent a letter
to plaintiff's counsel on February 14, 2022,
requesting more responsive answers. The
plaintiff did not respond to that letter, and
defendant filed a motion to compel. On
March 21, 2022, the Superior Court granted
defendant's motion by stipulation, giving
plaintiff forty-five days from a prior
hearing date to produce more responsive
answers to the interrogatories and requests
for production of documents.
<Page 371>

<P20>Over a month later, on April 29, 2022,
defendant filed a motion to enter final
judgment against plaintiff after he failed to
adhere to the Superior Court's March 21,
2022 order. The plaintiff did not object to
this motion. By agreement, the Superior
Court continued defendant's motion to enter
final judgment. At the hearing on May
26, 2022, defendant asserted that plaintiff
had yet to provide his emergency room
records stemming from the incident. The
plaintiff's counsel averred that she had
supplemented the interrogatory responses
and that she "just need[ed] a little time" to
submit supplemental requests for production.
Giving plaintiff his third chance, the
trial justice continued the hearing for two
weeks and informed plaintiff "[y]ou'll need
the response to answers by then, and I'll
grant the motion at [that] time."

<P20>On May 30, 2022, seemingly in response
to the representation by plaintiff's counsel
that she had provided adequate supplemental
interrogatory answers, defendant
filed a renewed motion for entry of final
judgment, arguing that&mdash;even though
plaintiff had provided supplemental answers
&mdash;the answers remained "evasive and
unresponsive" and defendant's request for
production was not supplemented. The defendant
asserted that plaintiff had not submitted
evidence showing his injuries to be
permanent, he had not disclosed his treating
provider, he had not turned over a list
of his nonpunitive damages, and his criminal
history was incomplete. The plaintiff
did not object to this motion.

<P20>On June 3, 2022, plaintiff produced supplemental
responses to defendant's request
for production, which still omitted plaintiff's
emergency room records and merely
included an insurance letter sent to Jackson
and "Notice of Claim" that was already
in defendant's possession. Both attorneys
represented at oral argument that
there was no communication between the
production of supplemental responses and
the hearing date. On June 9, 2022, defendant
appeared in Superior Court on its
renewed motion for entry of final judgment.
The plaintiff's counsel did not appear,
and the motion was granted. The
plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the order
granting defendant's motion to enter judgment
on the day before the order was
signed, and a separate judgment against
plaintiff entered. The defendant objected
to plaintiff's motion. At the July 7, 2022
hearing on plaintiff's motion to vacate,
plaintiff's counsel admitted she "mistakenly
assumed that [defendant's counsel]
wouldn't be pursuing the relief because
[plaintiff's counsel] had supplemented the
responses in accord with [defendant's
counsel's] request within days of the hearing."
Thereafter, the Superior Court denied
plaintiff's motion to vacate the order
granting defendant's request for the entry
of final judgment, stating at the hearing
that he "didn't see any objection to the
motion to enter final judgment, and it was
scheduled three times, and [he doesn't] see
any reason under Rule 60(b) to give the
plaintiff relief from judgment."

<P20>Almost a year later, on May 24, 2023,
plaintiff filed a "motion for relief[,]" arguing
that the Superior Court should relieve
plaintiff from the entry of default and final
judgment pursuant to Rules 60(b) and
55(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil
Procedure. The defendant filed a timely
objection. After a hearing, the Superior
Court denied plaintiff's motion. The plaintiff
filed a timely notice of appeal.

<CN><EMB>Standard of Review</EMB>

<P20>"Our review of a Rule 60(b) motion
`is limited to examining the correctness
of the order granting or denying the
motion, not the correctness of the original
judgment.'" <EM>Howell v. Urban League of
Rhode Island, Inc.,</EM> 307 A.3d 858, 860 (R.I.
2024) (quoting <EM>Santos v. D. Laikos, Inc.,</EM>
<Page 372>
139 A.3d 394, 398 (R.I. 2016)). "We have
also clearly stated that `Rule 60(b) does
not constitute a vehicle for the motion
justice to reconsider the previous judgment[]
in light of later-discovered legal
authority.'" <EM>Id.</EM> (deletion omitted) (quoting
<EM>Jackson v. Medical Coaches,</EM> 734 A.2d 502,
505 (R.I. 1999)). "A Rule 60(b) motion is
addressed to a hearing justice's sound discretion,
and we will not ordinarily overturn
a ruling with respect to such a motion
unless there has been an abuse of discretion."
<EM>Id.</EM>; <EM>see also Keystone Elevator Company,
Inc. v. Johnson & Wales University,</EM>
850 A.2d 912, 916 (R.I. 2004). As it pertains
to a Rule 60(b) motion, this Court
reviews the decision on a motion to vacate
an entry of default for an abuse of discretion
or an error of law. <EM>Ferris v. Progressive
Casualty Insurance Company,</EM> 263
A.3d 1247, 1249 (R.I. 2021).

<P20>Additionally, "Rule 55(c) authorizes

good cause shown.'" <EM>McCormick v. Narragansett
Improvement Company, Inc.,</EM> 314
A.3d 963, 966 (R.I. 2024) (brackets and
deletion omitted) (citing Super. R. Civ. P.
55(c)). "This Court also permits the trial
court to set aside a default pursuant to
Rule 55(c) `whenever the court finds that
the default was not the result of gross
neglect, that the nondefaulting party will
not be substantially prejudiced by the reopening,
and the party in default has a

Associates v. Centex General Contractors,
Inc.,</EM> 810 A.2d 242, 244 (R.I. 2002)).

<CN><EMB>Discussion</EMB>

<P20>At the outset, we consider whether this
appeal is interlocutory. In his supplemental
brief, plaintiff maintains that his appeal
is not interlocutory because the denial of a
motion for relief from a default judgment
is final and appealable. The plaintiff avers
that refusing to hear his appeal will deprive
plaintiff of his right to a trial on the
merits of his claims. By contrast, defendant
contends that plaintiff's appeal is interlocutory
and not properly before the
Court because the claims against Jackson
have not been adjudicated.

<P20>"[I]nterlocutory orders are those
that are provisional or temporary, or that
decide some intermediate point or matter
but are not a final decision of the whole
matter." <EM>Coit v. Tillinghast,</EM> 91 A.3d 838,
843 (R.I. 2014) (quoting <EM>Simpson v. Vose,</EM>
702 A.2d 1176, 1177 (R.I. 1997) (mem.)).
"Generally, interlocutory orders are not
subject to review unless the order or decree
falls within one of the exceptions set
forth in G.L. 1956 &sect; 9-24-7." <EM>Id.</EM> at 843-44
(deletion omitted) (quoting <EM>Cayer v. Cox
Rhode Island Telecom, LLC,</EM> 85 A.3d 1140,
1146 (R.I. 2014)). "Moreover, there is a
second type of exception that is `judicial in
origin.'" <EM>Id.</EM> at 844 (quoting <EM>Boranian v.
Richer,</EM> 983 A.2d 834, 837 (R.I. 2009)).
"This familiar exception says that `an order
may fall within the ambit of our judicially
created rule that permits review of
an interlocutory order that has such an
element of finality as to require immediate
review by this Court to avoid possible injurious
consequences.'" <EM>Id.</EM> (quoting <EM>Chiaradio
v. Falck,</EM> 794 A.2d 494, 496 (R.I. 2002)).

<P20>Inexplicably, and contrary to representations
made at oral argument, plaintiff's
counsel moved to default Jackson in the
Superior Court on October 28, 2024, three
days before oral argument. Despite questions
on the interlocutory nature of the
appeal, counsel for plaintiff never informed
the Court that she was in the process of
obtaining a default judgment. The default
judgment has not yet entered however,
therefore, plaintiff's appeal remains interlocutory.
Nevertheless, we believe remand
for the purpose of entering judgment
against Jackson would be futile. Jackson
<Page 373>
has not participated in this matter,<fnr3> and
remand would only serve to delay and
prolong this litigation. Accordingly, we
proceed to evaluate the merits of plaintiff's
appeal.

<P20>The plaintiff's May 24, 2023 "motion
for relief" cites Rules 60(b) and 55(c)
and any "applicable law otherwise * * *."
In support of his appeal, plaintiff first
argues that he has always acted in good
faith during discovery and should not be
subject to the "ultimate sanction" of dismissal.
The plaintiff also contends that the
Superior Court never properly examined
why defendant's counsel did not attempt to
communicate with plaintiff's counsel prior
to seeking a default order against plaintiff.
Further, plaintiff asserts that the Superior
Court failed to consider evidence of plaintiff's
good-faith compliance with discovery
response requirements, and the reasons
for delay plaintiff provided.

<P20>Moreover, according to plaintiff, the Superior
Court neglected to consider the
uniqueness of plaintiff's circumstances<fnr4>
surrounding noncompliance with the rules
and the other sections under Rule 60(b).
Finally, plaintiff maintains that the Superior
Court did not articulate the basis for
the entry of final judgment in favor of
defendant and that plaintiff was entitled to
relief under Rule 55(c).

<P20>By contrast, defendant contends that
plaintiff is effectively trying to appeal the
grant of that judgment through a motion
for relief and that appeal is untimely by
nearly one year. It asserts that plaintiff
had twenty days to appeal the Superior
Court's judgment and that a Rule 60 motion
cannot be a substitute for a timely
appeal. Additionally, defendant argues that
plaintiff has not offered any reasons why
he would be entitled to relief under Rule
60(b) in the face of "persistent" refusal to
participate in discovery by providing answers
that are evasive and incomplete. The
defendant continues that plaintiff failed to
produce the sought-after medical records
until almost one year after final judgment
entered in defendant's favor. The defendant
states that plaintiff never advised defendant
that plaintiff was having difficulty
acquiring his medical records.

<P20>The defendant points to two examples of
plaintiff's purportedly deficient responses,
noting that plaintiff stated he did "not
know what" it meant to provide his non-punitive
damages against defendant, instead
referring the question to his attorney,
and that he did not list all of his
criminal convictions. The defendant maintains
that the discovery sought from plaintiff
was central to plaintiff's personal injury
claim and that defendant needs the
information in order to formulate an adequate
response.

<P20>The record is clear that the trial justice
denied plaintiff's motion and rejected his
counsel's position that confusion over
plaintiff's birth date caused a delay in receiving
plaintiff's hospital records and that
plaintiff's counsel had lost contact with
plaintiff periodically during the litigation.
The plaintiff's counsel admitted that she
did not object to the motion for entry of
judgment because she "didn't think that
the defendant was going to pursue that
motion," despite never receiving any indication
of the sort from defendant's counsel,
either verbally or in writing. The plaintiff's
<Page 374>
counsel reiterated that dismissing his
claims based on discovery shortfalls, in
light of plaintiff's good faith, was a harsh
remedy. At the conclusion of the hearing
on the motion for relief, the trial justice
stated: "[E]specially the timeline that it
took almost a year from July 18th of 2022
when I granted the default judgment until
May 24th, 2023, * * * I don't see what
circumstances would have changed * * *."
Given plaintiff's failure to object to defendant's
motion and the extensive time frame
in between the denial of the motion to
vacate and the filing of the motion for
relief, the trial justice rejected plaintiff's
contentions.

<P20>Before this Court, the plaintiff has repackaged
these same arguments and asks
us to determine that the trial justice
abused his discretion. The plaintiff was
given ample opportunity to comply with
his discovery obligations and failed to do
so. Supplementing discovery answers nearly
a year after a default judgment entered
against a party does not constitute compliance
with discovery. While we acknowledge
the difficulties the plaintiff faced
when he was displaced from his home after
the fire, we cannot force the defendant
to litigate on the plaintiff's timeline in contravention
to our rules. The plaintiff has
provided no persuasive argument that the
trial justice abused his discretion or committed
an error of law in denying the
plaintiff's motion. <EM>See Ferris,</EM> 263 A.3d at
1249; <EM>see also Hogan v. McAndrew,</EM> 131
A.3d 717, 722 (R.I. 2016) ("Abuse occurs
when a material factor deserving significant
weight is ignored, when an improper
factor is relied upon, or when all proper
and no improper factors are assessed, but
the court makes a serious mistake in
weighing them.") (quoting <EM>Independent Oil
and Chemical Workers of Quincy, Inc. v.
Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Co.,</EM> 864
F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir. 1988)).

<CN><EMB>Conclusion</EMB>

<P20>For the reasons set forth herein, we
affirm the order of the Superior Court.
The papers may be returned to the Superior
Court.
<FN>
<fnt1> The other plaintiff in the Superior Court,
Jeanette Knott, is not a party to this appeal,
and final judgment has entered against her.

<fnt2> The other defendant in this matter, Dexter
Jackson (Jackson), has not participated in this
litigation. While he has not had a default
judgment enter against him as of the date of
this opinion, he is not a party to this appeal,
so we refer only to defendant, the City of
Providence when we discuss the defendant. It
must be noted that the plaintiff moved for a
default to be entered against Jackson just
prior to oral argument in this matter.

<fnt3> Our review of the Superior Court docket
reveals that Jackson was served with a summons
through a corporate entity in Pawtucket,
Rhode Island. He did not submit an
answer to plaintiff's complaint, nor has he
participated at any stage of this litigation.

<fnt4> The plaintiff argued that he was displaced
from his home as a result of the fire and
unable to meaningfully participate in this litigation
and that his incorrect birthdate at the
hospital delayed his attorney's ability to obtain
his medical records.

[MJ]
<P20><dgn>Justice</dgn> <author>Lynch Prata</author>, for the Court.
[MT]
<P20>The petitioner, Charles Smith (petitioner),
seeks review of an October 27, 2021
judgment of the Superior Court denying
his application for postconviction relief. On
April 6, 2023, we granted the petition for
writ of certiorari and subsequently issued
an order directing the parties to appear
and show cause why the issues raised in
the petition should not be summarily decided.
After considering the parties' written
and oral submissions and carefully reviewing
the record, we conclude that cause
has not been shown and that this case may
be decided without further briefing or argument.
For the reasons set forth herein,
we affirm the judgment of the Superior
Court.

<CN><EMB>Facts and Travel</EMB>

<P20>The factual background of this case is
described in our previous decision concerning
petitioner's direct appeal of his conviction.
<EM>State v. Smith,</EM> 766 A.2d 913, 915-18
(R.I. 2001). Accordingly, we shall recount
only those facts necessary for our analysis
of the issues relevant to this petition.

<P20>On February 13, 1998, petitioner was
found guilty of first-degree murder for the
brutal stabbing of Kristen Benard (Benard),
the sixteen-year-old daughter of petitioner's
then-wife. <EM>Smith,</EM> 766 A.2d at
915, 918. Benard was stabbed multiple
times, and petitioner admitted to having
intercourse with her corpse. <EM>Id.</EM> at 916-17.
<Page 377>
The jury determined that the murder was
committed by torture and aggravated battery.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 918. On April 20, 1998, petitioner
was sentenced to life imprisonment
without the possibility of parole and was
also sentenced to an additional fifteen
years to be served consecutively as a habitual
offender. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>On appeal, petitioner argued (1) that the
trial justice erred in admitting petitioner's
custodial statements to police; (2) that a
sentence of life without parole was improper
due to mitigating factors&mdash;including his
serious mental illness, troubled upbringing,
and lack of premeditation; and (3) that
the trial justice erred in determining that
petitioner was a habitual offender. <EM>Smith,</EM>
766 A.2d at 918, 920, 923. We largely rejected
these contentions. <EM>See id.</EM> at 925.

<P20>First, we determined that petitioner's
confession to police had been voluntary
and occurred after police read petitioner
his <EM>Miranda</EM> rights. <EM>Smith,</EM> 766 A.2d at
919-20. Next, we dispatched the notion
that the trial justice improperly sentenced
petitioner to life without the possibility of
parole. <EM>Id.</EM> at 923. Specifically, we rejected
petitioner's argument that his heinous
crime was not premeditated. <EM>Id.</EM> at 922.

<P20>Additionally, and most pertinent to this
matter, we determined that petitioner's
failure to take his anti-psychotic medication
prior to the killing did not require a
more lenient sentence than life without the
possibility of parole. <EM>Smith,</EM> 766 A.2d at
923. We labeled petitioner's statement that
he did not take his anti-psychotic medication
because of its unpleasant side effects
as "isolated" that did not, "by any
stretch, support his contention that he
raped and murdered [Benard] largely because
he had failed to stay on his medication."
<EM>Id.</EM> We further concluded that petitioner's
unfortunate childhood did not
override the other aggravating circumstances
accompanying the murder. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>Finally, we vacated petitioner's consecutive
sentence, concluding that the state
had not met its burden of proving petitioner
was a "habitual offender" under G.L.
1956 &sect; 12-19-21(b). <EM>Smith,</EM> 766 A.2d at 925.
Ultimately, petitioner's murder conviction
and life-without-parole sentence were affirmed,
and petitioner's additional fifteen-year
habitual offender sentence was vacated.
<EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>On September 7, 2018, petitioner filed a
<EM>pro se</EM> application for post-conviction relief
that generally alleged that his sentence
and conviction<fnr1> were in violation of the
United States Constitution and the Rhode
Island State Constitution. Later, upon appointment
of counsel and in his post-hearing
memorandum, petitioner alleged that
his application was based on ineffective
assistance of counsel by failing to present
mitigating evidence at sentencing. He argued
that his trial counsel (1) failed to
sufficiently inform the trial justice of petitioner's
mental health issues and (2) neglected
to present evidence that, because
petitioner was not taking his medication at
the time of the offense, he was incapable of
inflicting the requisite harm to justify a
sentence of life without parole. The state's
answer to petitioner's initial <EM>pro se</EM> application
raised the affirmative defenses of <EM>res
judicata</EM> and laches. Moreover, the state
maintained that petitioner's trial counsel
was effective because she presented evidence
of petitioner's mental illness while
declining to call petitioner's doctor because
it was a "dangerous thing to do."
<Page 378>

<P20>At the Superior Court hearing on June
21, 2021, petitioner and his trial counsel
took the stand. The petitioner testified
that he and trial counsel had a positive
relationship until he was offered a plea
bargain. According to petitioner, he received
an offer approximately eight
months before trial to plead guilty to first-degree
murder and first-degree sexual assault
for a sentence of life with the possibility
of parole and a consecutive sentence
of twenty-five years. The petitioner then
contended that he requested that trial
counsel present a counteroffer that did not
require him to plead guilty to first-degree
sexual assault; petitioner recalled that trial
counsel was reticent to take his proposed
counteroffer to the state.

<P20>Further, petitioner expressed that he
was disappointed that trial counsel did not
call petitioner's doctor to testify at the
trial, that trial counsel did not adequately
present mitigating evidence at the sentencing
phase, and that she failed to present
sufficient evidence related to petitioner not
taking his prescribed medication at the
time of the murder. Notwithstanding these
contentions, petitioner admitted that he
ceased taking his medication prior to the
murder because of the medication's unpleasant
side effects.

<P20>According to trial counsel's testimony,
however, the state never proposed a sentence
of less than life without the possibility
of parole. She further stated that she
was familiar with petitioner's background
and mental health history and offered mitigating
evidence to the state so that it
might change its sentencing recommendation.
Trial counsel testified that, although
she offered mitigating evidence to the trial
justice during the trial and sentencing
stages, trial counsel ultimately made the
strategic determination not to include testimony
from petitioner's doctor or to present
evidence that petitioner decided to
stop taking his prescribed medication at
the time of the murder because trial counsel
was concerned that those options could
have a negative impact due to the fact that
once the doctor was subject to cross-examination,
further damage could be done. She
testified that she believed that all mental
health records she had were conveyed to
the trial justice.

<P20>On September 13, 2021, the hearing justice
filed his written decision, denying the
petition for postconviction relief. The analysis
began by finding that the state failed
to meet its burden of proving the affirmative
defense of laches and that the claim
was not barred by <EM>res judicata</EM> as the issue
of ineffective assistance of counsel had not
been previously raised on appeal. The
hearing justice continued by assessing petitioner's
claims of ineffective assistance of
counsel, utilizing the two-prong standard
outlined in <EM>Strickland v. Washington,</EM> 466
U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674
(1984). Noting the heavy burden placed on
a plaintiff claiming ineffective assistance of
counsel, the hearing justice determined
that trial counsel's performance was not
defective and that even if it was, it was not
unduly prejudicial towards petitioner.

<P20>Specifically, the hearing justice determined
that trial counsel made a "strategic
decision" not to call petitioner's doctor,
because petitioner's records were contained
in the presentence report (the report)
and trial counsel thought it would be
imprudent for the trial justice to learn that
petitioner had chosen not to comply with
medical orders. The hearing justice concluded
that trial counsel "was a [p]ublic
[d]efender for thirty-three years" and
"based on her experience, calling a doctor
to testify in this scenario was a dangerous
strategic move," labeling her decision
"well-founded." The hearing justice stated
that petitioner had failed to carry his burden
of showing that trial counsel's representation
<Page 379>
fell below the objective standard
of reasonableness and that trial counsel's
performance "cannot be said to rise to the
level of defective performance." He further
found that there was no evidence that
would have rendered a different outcome
had trial counsel called petitioner's doctor
to testify at sentencing. The hearing justice
also made a specific finding that trial
counsel presented both petitioner's troubled
childhood and mental health issues to
the court at the pretrial and sentencing
stages. Accordingly, the hearing justice
found that petitioner failed to meet his
burden and denied his application for post-conviction
relief.

<CN><EMB>Analysis</EMB>

<P20>The petitioner first argues that trial
counsel failed to convey his counteroffer
to the state. The petitioner contends that
he requested, on numerous occasions, that
trial counsel make a counteroffer to the
state's proposed plea bargain, but trial
counsel declined. The petitioner submits
that, in failing to convey his counteroffer
to the state, trial counsel was in violation
of Rule 1.2 of the Rules of Professional
Conduct, falling below the objective standard
of reasonableness required by <EM>Strickland.</EM>

<P20>However, petitioner failed to raise the
issue in his postconviction-relief proceeding
in the Superior Court; therefore, it is
waived. Specifically, petitioner's post-hearing
postconviction-relief memorandum
does not discuss an instance in which trial
counsel refused to convey a counteroffer to
the state whereby petitioner would have
pled guilty to murder and habitual offender
violations in exchange for a sentence of
life with the possibility of parole. Because
petitioner failed to raise this argument to
the Superior Court, he is barred from
doing so here. <EM>See Cronan,</EM> 307 A.3d at 192
("[I]ssues not properly presented before
the trial court may not be raised for the
<Page 380>
first time on appeal.") (quoting <EM>Donnelly
Real Estate, LLC,</EM> 291 A.3d at 994).

<P20>The petitioner next argues that trial
counsel acted unreasonably by failing to
proffer an insanity defense at trial. The
petitioner avers that he asked his attorney
to call his doctor as a witness at his trial,
but trial counsel declined, stating that she
would call the doctor during the sentencing
phase. According to petitioner, trial
counsel did not adequately investigate petitioner's
mental health history, leading trial
counsel to erroneously conclude that an
insanity defense was inadvisable. The state
posits that petitioner abandoned this argument
by failing to raise it in his post-hearing
memorandum in the Superior
Court. The state asserts that, even if that
position had been preserved for appeal,
trial counsel made an informed, strategic
decision not to pursue the insanity defense
after sufficiently investigating and discussing
the merits of the defense with petitioner.

<P20>The petitioner's post-hearing memorandum
filed in the Superior Court lacks any
discussion of trial counsel's purported failure
to proffer an insanity defense on petitioner's
behalf. Further, petitioner's memorandum
before this Court declares that
he does not take issue with his conviction,
but instead challenges only his sentence.
<EM>See Cronan,</EM> 307 A.3d at 192 (holding that
failure to press an issue at the Superior
Court level bars petitioner from advancing
the claim now). Consequently, this argument
is waived.

<P20>Next, petitioner argues that his trial
counsel was obligated to obtain a competency
evaluation, but no evidence exists
suggesting that she did so. The petitioner
submits that trial counsel's failure to secure
the evaluation was objectively unreasonable
and prejudiced petitioner. The
state responds that petitioner waived his
right to appeal this issue. Alternatively,
the state contends that trial counsel did
not have reason to question petitioner's
competency until after his incarceration
and was under no mandate to order such
an evaluation. The state advances that it
was only upon petitioner's incarceration
that trial counsel determined that a competency
evaluation should be performed.

<P20>Additionally, the petitioner did not raise
the issue of his competency before the
lower court. Therefore, petitioner waived
his right to a claim of ineffective assistance
of counsel on the basis of trial counsel's
failure to convey his counteroffer to the
state, failure to pursue an insanity defense,
and failure to obtain a competency evaluation
for petitioner. <EM>See Cronan,</EM> 307 A.3d at
192.

<P20>Lastly, petitioner contends that trial
counsel should have introduced mitigating
evidence at petitioner's sentencing
hearing, including his mental health issues
at the time of the crime, his failure to take
medication prior to the crime, a determination
in connection with his criminal conviction
in Utah<fnr2> that he could not weigh the
costs and benefits of treatment, and his
doctor's testimony. The petitioner argues
that he pressed his trial counsel to call his
doctor at trial and sentencing but trial
counsel declined. Instead, petitioner concedes
that trial counsel referred to the
doctor's potential testimony as a "double-edged
sword[.]" The petitioner avers that
he implored trial counsel to put into evidence
"everything to get the sentence
<Page 381>
down" but trial counsel neglected to do so
during sentencing.

<P20>In response, the state submits that trial
counsel's decision not to call petitioner's
doctor during sentencing was strategic and
well-founded. The state further argues
that trial counsel testified that she presented
all of petitioner's health records in
her possession at the time of the proceeding
and that probation created the report,
which detailed his extensive mental health
challenges. Additionally, the state maintains,
trial counsel testified that she alerted
the trial justice to petitioner's mental
illness at sentencing and that she was cautious
about making the trial justice aware
of petitioner's decision to forgo taking his
medication.

<P20>Moreover, the state proffers that petitioner
failed to show that his trial counsel's
purported subpar performance caused petitioner
to suffer prejudice. To this point,
the state notes that petitioner did not call
his, or any, doctor to testify at his postconviction
proceeding, making it impossible to
determine that a lack of testimony at sentencing
resulted in prejudice to petitioner.
The state further contends that petitioner
did not suffer any prejudice from trial
counsel's alleged neglect to introduce medical
records at sentencing. The state declares
that the Newport County Medical
Records reflect petitioner's long history of
treatment for mental illness, including in
the months immediately preceding the
murder. The state concludes by pointing to
the mountain of aggravating circumstances
in which the murder was committed that
purports to justify the sentence imposed.

<P20>This Court evaluates claims of
ineffective assistance of counsel according
to the two-pronged standard outlined in
<EM>Strickland. LeFebvre v. State,</EM> 313 A.3d
1156, 1162 (R.I. 2024). "Under this framework,
an applicant for postconviction relief
first `must establish that counsel's performance
was constitutionally deficient'";
which mandates a "showing that counsel
made errors so serious that counsel was
not functioning as the counsel guaranteed
by the Sixth Amendment." <EM>Reyes v. State,</EM>
141 A.3d 644, 654 (R.I. 2016) (deletion
omitted) (quoting <EM>Bido v. State,</EM> 56 A.3d
104, 110-11 (R.I. 2012)). With respect to
the performance prong, "the applicant
must show that counsel's representation
fell below an objective standard of reasonableness."
<EM>Id.</EM> (brackets omitted) (quoting
<EM>Strickland,</EM> 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct.
2052). This Court, like many others, evaluates
trial counsel's performance "in a highly
deferential manner, * * * employing `a
strong presumption that counsel's conduct
falls within the permissible range of assistance.'"
<EM>Id.</EM> at 654-55 (quoting <EM>Bido,</EM> 56
A.3d at 111).

<P20>If the first prong is satisfied,
the second prong requires that the petitioner
then must "show that he or she was
prejudiced by this deficient performance."
<EM>Reyes,</EM> 141 A.3d at 655 (brackets omitted)
(quoting <EM>Bido,</EM> 56 A.3d at 111). This prong
requires petitioner to "show that there is a
reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of
the proceeding would have been different.
A reasonable probability is a probability
sufficient to undermine confidence in the
outcome." <EM>Id.</EM> (quoting <EM>Strickland,</EM> 466
U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052).

<P20>Here, we conclude, as the hearing justice
did, that trial counsel's performance
during the sentencing phase was objectively
reasonable. In his decision, the hearing
justice noted that petitioner and trial counsel
discussed calling his "mental health
doctor" but that trial counsel advised petitioner
that trial counsel believed it would
be best not to call the doctor because his
testimony could be a "double-edged
sword[.]" Trial counsel testified at the
postconviction proceeding that it would
<Page 382>
have been "very dangerous" to call petitioner's
doctor given the risk of potentially
damning cross-examination testimony that
could be elicited by the state, including the
fact that petitioner voluntarily ceased taking
his medication in favor of drinking
alcohol and, as petitioner testified, an uninhibited
sex drive.

<P20>The hearing justice specifically pointed
to trial counsel's testimony that it is "hard
to get sympathy from a Judge or a jury if
the person made a choice not to comply
with their * * * medical orders." The
hearing justice found that not calling the
doctor was a "well-founded strategic decision[,]"
particularly considering that petitioner's
medical records were included in
the presentencing report. In his briefing
and at oral argument, petitioner did not
present this Court with any reasoning&mdash;
compelling or otherwise&mdash;that could meet
petitioner's burden of showing the hearing
justice was clearly wrong in finding trial
counsel's testimony credible. Having the
benefit of observing trial counsel's testimony
himself, the hearing justice concluded
that trial counsel made a strategic decision
to submit evidence of petitioner's mental
health challenges through the report while
avoiding calling attention to the fact that
petitioner was not taking his medication as
directed.

<P20>We have previously stated that
"tactical decisions by trial counsel, even if
ill-advised, do not by themselves constitute
ineffective assistance of counsel." <EM>Linde v.
State,</EM> 78 A.3d 738, 747 (R.I. 2013) (quoting
<EM>Rivera v. State,</EM> 58 A.3d 171, 180-81 (R.I.
2013)). "This Court will not meticulously
scrutinize an attorney's reasoned judgment
or strategic maneuver in the context of a
claim of ineffective assistance of counsel."
<EM>Id.</EM> (quoting <EM>Rivera,</EM> 58 A.3d at 181). The
petitioner asks us to do precisely that.
Doing so would create an unworkable mandate
that requires all criminal defense advocates
to submit every piece of potentially
mitigating evidence that exists to a trial
justice&mdash;strategic discretion to the wind&mdash;
or risk a declaration of ineffective assistance
of counsel. The petitioner has failed
to meet his burden of showing that the
hearing justice was clearly wrong when he
concluded that trial counsel credibly testified
that she did not call petitioner's mental
health doctor to avoid risking disclosure
that petitioner was not taking his medication
as directed. <EM>See Rice,</EM> 38 A.3d at 17
n.11.

<P20>The record before us indicates that petitioner
was assigned a seasoned trial lawyer
&mdash;one with murder trial experience&mdash;
who chose to present evidence of petitioner's
mental health in the light trial counsel
believed most favorable to petitioner. That
is, trial counsel discretely introduced detailed
evidence of petitioner's mental
health issues without tainting the trial justice's
judgment by highlighting petitioner's
substance usage and sex drive as reasons
for discontinuing his medication. The hearing
justice determined that trial counsel's
testimony about her strategy was "well-founded."
He based this decision on trial
counsel's extensive experience as a public
defender. Additionally, the hearing justice
found that trial counsel submitted records
to the trial justice through the presentence
report. The petitioner falls woefully short
of overcoming his burden of showing this
conclusion was clearly wrong.

<P20>Further, the records submitted to the
trial justice at sentencing show that the
trial justice was informed of the petitioner's
mental health treatment history at the
time the petitioner received his sentence of
life without parole. The report details the
petitioner's extensive mental health treatment
history. The report includes health
records that reference the petitioner's first
institutionalization at age six, and subsequent
treatments at Rhode Island's Institute
<Page 383>
of Mental Health, Elmcrest Psychiatric
Center in Portland, Connecticut, the
Rhode Island Training School, and a two-year
stay at a psychiatric facility in Utah.
All of this information was in the hands of
the trial justice when he determined that
the petitioner's mental health issues did
not mitigate the aggravating circumstances
of his grisly crime. Accordingly,
the petitioner's argument that trial counsel
should have presented additional evidence
of mental health treatment is without merit,
and, therefore, we cannot conclude that
trial counsel's representation was deficient.
Because we have determined that the petitioner
failed to satisfy the first prong of
<EM>Strickland,</EM> we need not go further. <EM>Linde,</EM>
78 A.3d at 745-46.

<CN><EMB>Conclusion</EMB>

<P20>For the reasons set forth herein, we
affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.
The record may be remanded to the Superior
Court.
<FN>
<fnt1> In his statement filed pursuant to Article I,
Rule 12A of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate
Procedure, and later at oral argument,
petitioner asked the Court to "vacate his sentence
(not his conviction) and resentence him
to life with the possibility of parole." Accordingly,
we confine our decision to his sentence
only.

<fnt2> At his postconviction hearing, petitioner testified
that he was arrested for breaking and
entering while in Utah. Shortly thereafter,
petitioner stated, he was ordered to be committed
to Utah State Hospital. He testified
that he was later paroled and returned to
Rhode Island.

<P20>The respondent, the Commissioner of
Correction, appeals following the granting
of his petition for certification to appeal
from the judgment of the habeas court
granting the second amended petition for a
writ of habeas corpus filed by the petitioner,
Orema Taft, in which the petitioner
alleged, inter alia, that his habeas counsel
in a prior habeas action rendered ineffective
assistance. On appeal, the respondent
claims that the habeas court improperly
granted the petitioner's second amended
habeas petition because the petitioner
failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced
by the alleged ineffective assistance
of his first habeas counsel. We agree with
the respondent and reverse the judgment
of the court.

<P20>The following facts and procedural history,
as set forth by our Supreme Court in
the petitioner's direct appeal from his conviction
or as undisputed in the record, are
relevant to our resolution of the petitioner's
appeal. "On September 28, 2001,
shortly before 3 a.m., the victim, Zoltan
Kiss, was shot and killed in his car in the
area of 1185 Pembroke Street in Bridgeport.
Just prior to the shooting, the victim
parked his car across
<SPage 550>
from 1185 Pembroke
Street, exited the vehicle, approached
some individuals on the street to
seek change for a $100 bill and, thereafter,
approached a gate leading to an alley next
to 1185 Pembroke Street (gate). Shortly
thereafter, a group of people, including the
[petitioner], exited from behind the gate
and followed the victim as he returned to
his car. When the victim reached his car,
at least one of the pursuers, Miguel Zapata,<fnr1>
<Page 390>
began firing a handgun at the victim.
Additionally, before the gunfire, one witness
heard someone in the group say,
`Let's get this mother fucker.'

<P20>"During the autopsy, the medical examiner
determined that Kiss' death was
caused by multiple gunshot wounds, and
that, of the twenty-five bullet wounds in
Kiss' body, seventeen were entry wounds.
The examiner from the state police forensic
laboratory firearms unit analyzed a total
of eighteen shell casings recovered
from the ground in the area of the victim's
car; nine were nine millimeter casings and
nine were .40 caliber casings. He determined
that all of the nine millimeter casings
were fired from one gun, and all of
the .40 caliber casings were fired from
another single gun." (Footnote in original.)
<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Taft,</EM> 306 Conn. 749, 751-52, 51
A.3d 988 (2012).

<P20>Following an investigation, the petitioner
and Zapata were both arrested and
charged with the victim's murder. Specifically,
"the state charged the [petitioner]
with murder with a firearm in violation of
General Statutes &sect;&sect; 53a-54a(a) and 53-202k,
conspiracy to commit murder with a
firearm in violation of &sect;&sect; 53a-48, 53a-54a(a)
<SPage 551>
and 53-202k, criminal possession of a
firearm in violation of General Statutes
&sect; 53a-217(a), and carrying a pistol without
a permit in violation of General Statutes
&sect; 29-35(a)." <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Taft,</EM> supra, 306 Conn.
at 752, 51 A.3d 988; see also footnote 1 of
this opinion. Zapata's trial occurred prior
to the petitioner's trial, and the prosecutor
for both trials was C. Robert Satti, Jr.
Zapata was represented by Attorney
Frank O'Reilly during his criminal trial,
and the petitioner's criminal trial counsel
was Attorney Erroll Skyers.

<P20>At the petitioner's criminal trial, the
state presented the testimony of five witnesses<fnr2>
and of the police officers who had
investigated the victim's murder.<fnr3> "[T]wo
witnesses, A and B, testified that they had
seen the [petitioner] in the area behind the
gate with a number of other individuals.<fnr4> A
and B also testified that they had seen
guns behind the gate where the [petitioner]
and his companions were located. Both
A and B recounted that they had seen the
victim park his car across the street from
the gate and approach the gate. A testified
that she had seen the victim interact with
<Page 391>
someone behind the gate and then begin to
return to his car. Shortly thereafter, A saw
the group behind the gate chase after the
victim, and A further recounted
<SPage 552>
that she
had seen both Zapata and the [petitioner]
carrying guns as they pursued the victim
to his car. B also testified that she had
heard someone say, `Let's get this mother
fucker' before gunfire erupted. Both A and
B then testified that they had heard shouting
and gunfire, and had seen the muzzle
flashes as the guns were fired at the victim.<fnr5>

<P20>"The state then presented the testimony
of another witness, C,<fnr6> who, at the time of
the shooting lived in a third floor apartment
of a nearby building. C stated that,
at approximately 2 or 3 a.m., on September
28, 2001, she had heard gunfire coming
from the street located in front of her
apartment. When she went to investigate
the noise, C saw four people&mdash;the [petitioner],
Zapata, Luisa Bermudez and A&mdash;
standing in front of the door of a car on
the street. C further recounted that she
had seen the muzzle flashes as the guns
were fired at the victim, and she had heard
the
<SPage 553>
victim screaming. She also stated
that, from her perspective, she could only
see Zapata holding a gun and that, after
the shooting stopped, the group ran from
the scene....

<P20>"[T]he state [also] presented testimony
from several individuals who had had contact
with the [petitioner] while the charges
in the present case were pending. First, D
testified that he was incarcerated in the
same prison as the [petitioner], and that
the [petitioner] had told him that he and
Zapata had shot a `dude' in a Honda seven
times with a .45 caliber gun. D then recounted
that the [petitioner] had told him
that he and Zapata had chased after the
victim because they wanted to take the
victim's jewelry. Then, the state presented
the testimony of [Germaine O'Grinc],<fnr7> who
testified that, during one of his court appearances
in connection with a felony
charge, he was in the `bullpen lockup' of
the courthouse with the [petitioner] and
Zapata. [O'Grinc] recounted that Zapata
had told him that he was in court because
he and the [petitioner] had shot a person
in his car. [O'Grinc] further testified that
<Page 392>
the [petitioner] had confirmed or `vouched
for' Zapata's statements and had nodded in
agreement while Zapata was talking to
[O'Grinc]." (Footnotes added; footnote in
original; footnote omitted.) <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Taft,</EM>
supra, 306 Conn. at 753-55, 51 A.3d 988.

<P20>During Skyers' cross-examination of
O'Grinc at the petitioner's criminal trial,
O'Grinc acknowledged that he wanted to
get some type of benefit for having provided
his statement to the police. O'Grinc
further stated that he was facing a term of
imprisonment of forty-five years for
charges against him at that time and that
he hoped to get some type of benefit for
testifying at the petitioner's criminal trial,
although nothing had been
<SPage 554>
promised to
him. On redirect examination, the prosecutor
asked O'Grinc whether he was aware
that, if he lied under oath, it could affect
any benefit he hoped to receive with respect
to the charges pending against him,
to which he responded in the affirmative.
On recross-examination, he clarified that
he was saying that he would not lie under
oath.

<P20>Following a jury trial, the petitioner was
found guilty of murder and conspiracy to
commit murder. The trial court rendered a
judgment of conviction in accordance with
the jury's verdict and sentenced the petitioner
"to forty-five years [of] imprisonment
on the murder count and twenty
years [of] imprisonment on the conspiracy
count to run concurrently with each other
and consecutively to a sentence that the
[petitioner] already was serving on an unrelated
conviction." <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Taft,</EM> supra,
306 Conn. at 752-53, 51 A.3d 988. The
petitioner filed a direct appeal from the
judgment of conviction to our Supreme
Court, which affirmed the judgment of the
trial court. See id. at 751 and n.3, 51 A.3d
988.

<P20>The petitioner thereafter brought his
first habeas action, during which he was
represented by Attorney Bruce McIntyre.
In a second amended habeas petition that
was filed on December 10, 2012, the petitioner
alleged, inter alia, that his trial
counsel, Skyers, provided ineffective assistance
by failing (1) to conduct an adequate
investigation of the state's offer of a reward
for the victim's murder, the testimony
of A, B, and C at Zapata's criminal trial
concerning the reward, and O'Grinc's testimony
at Zapata's trial, at which O'Grinc
recanted a statement previously made to
the police that inculpated the petitioner,
and (2) to cross-examine A, B, and C regarding
the reward and O'Grinc regarding
his recantation. See <EM>Taft</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 159 Conn. App. 537, 543,
545, 556, 124 A.3d 1, cert. denied, 320
Conn. 910, 128 A.3d 954 (2015). Following
a habeas trial, the habeas court rendered
judgment
<SPage 555>
denying the second amended
habeas petition and, thereafter, denied the
petition for certification to appeal, and the
petitioner appealed to this court. Id. at
543, 124 A.3d 1.

<P20>In the petitioner's appeal in the first
habeas action, this court set forth the following
additional facts. "Prior to the petitioner's
arrest, due to the stalled nature of
the investigation of the victim's murder,
the governor signed an offer of a $50,000
reward for information leading to the `arrest
and conviction' of the guilty parties. A,
B, and C knew about the reward and each
received a portion of the reward money
after the petitioner's conviction. All three
witnesses testified at Zapata's trial, which
occurred prior to the petitioner's trial, and
O'Reilly cross-examined all three witnesses
about the reward. O'Reilly also
cross-examined O'Grinc about a statement
inculpating the petitioner and Zapata,
which O'Grinc had previously made to the
police. On cross-examination, at Zapata's
trial, O'Grinc recanted his prior statement
inculpating the petitioner. <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Zapata,</EM>
<Page 393>
119 Conn. App. 660, 667-68, 989 A.2d 626,
cert. denied, 296 Conn. 906, 992 A.2d 1136
(2010).

<P20>"In preparation for the petitioner's trial,
Skyers did not attend Zapata's trial. Instead,
Skyers spoke to O'Reilly about what
had occurred at Zapata's trial and discussed
with him who the important witnesses
were. Relying on O'Reilly's representations,
Skyers did not order all of the
transcripts from Zapata's trial, including
any portion of O'Grinc's testimony. Skyers
did request and read the trial transcripts
of the testimony of A, B, and C. At the
petitioner's criminal trial, Skyers did not
cross-examine any of the witnesses about
the reward and did not confront O'Grinc
about his recantation. O'Grinc testified
against the petitioner in accordance with
his prior statement inculpating the petitioner
by stating that while in lockup with
the petitioner and Zapata, Zapata admitted
to his and the petitioner's involvement
in the murder, and the petitioner nodded
in agreement.
<SPage 556>

<P20>"The habeas court found that Skyers
`was aware of and investigated the reward.
He spoke with [O'Reilly] and reviewed relevant
portions of the codefendant's criminal
trial transcripts. After these efforts,
[Skyers] made an informed tactical decision
to not pursue a line of questioning
that had already proved to be unfruitful in
[Zapata's] trial.' The habeas court, however,
did not make a specific finding regarding
precisely when Skyers became aware
of the reward.<fnr8>" (Footnote in original.) <EM>Taft</EM>
v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra, 159
Conn. App. at 545-46, 124 A.3d 1.

<P20>On appeal in the first habeas action, this
court determined that "the petitioner's
claim regarding Skyers' deficient performance
as it relates to his allegedly inadequate
investigation of the petitioner's case
[was] debatable amongst jurists of reason";
id. at 553, 124 A.3d 1; as "Skyers'
sole reliance on the representations and
opinions of O'Reilly regarding what evidence
from Zapata's trial would be important
for the defense of the petitioner
raise[d] a meritorious claim of deficient
performance." Id. at 548, 124 A.3d 1.
Nonetheless, this court concluded that the
first habeas court "properly found that the
petitioner failed to demonstrate any prejudice
by any lack of proper investigation,
and, thus, it did not abuse its discretion by
denying the petition for certification to
appeal as to th[at] claim." Id. at 553, 124
A.3d 1. In reaching that conclusion, this
court explained that "[t]he petitioner offered
no evidence at the habeas trial as to
what Skyers would have discovered if he
had read the entire transcript of Zapata's
trial. The petitioner did not provide the
habeas court with those trial transcripts.
Furthermore, <EM>the petitioner also did not
offer evidence regarding how O'Grinc or</EM>
<SPage 557>
<EM>A, B and C would have testified if they
had been cross-examined about the recantation
or reward,</EM> respectively." (Emphasis
added.) Id. at 554, 124 A.3d 1. This court
further stated that, "even if the petitioner
had offered the witnesses' testimony or the
Zapata transcripts as evidence, he did not
establish how this evidence would tend to
demonstrate that Skyers would have
changed his defense strategy and chosen
to cross-examine the witnesses about the
reward and recantation. Indeed, the habeas
court found that, if the witnesses had
been cross-examined about the reward,
Satti would have been able to rehabilitate
<Page 394>
them on redirect examination with evidence
damaging to the petitioner: `Further
buttressing [Skyers'] tactical decision was
the very reasonable concern of opening the
door to additional [and harmful rehabilitation]
questioning,' namely, that A, B, and
C would have testified to having other
motives for testifying at the criminal trial
other than the reward&mdash;C was motivated
to testify by almost being killed in the past
for being thought as a snitch in the present
case; B was motivated to testify by
fear as Zapata had tried to murder her in
the courtroom during Zapata's trial; and A
was motivated to testify by being arrested
and forced to testify pursuant to a capias
warrant. As for O'Grinc, Satti would have
shown that the petitioner, Zapata, and
O'Grinc had a prior history, including alleged
participation in the same drug operation
and a familial relationship between
Zapata and O'Grinc. The habeas court
found Satti['s] and Skyers' testimony at
the habeas trial credible as to the rehabilitation
evidence being more harmful than
the cross-examinations being beneficial.

<P20>"[This court thus] agree[d] with the habeas
court's conclusion that the petitioner
failed to establish that he was prejudiced
by Skyers' deficient performance, as he did
not [offer] any evidence of how the result
of his trial would have been different if
Skyers had reviewed the Zapata trial transcript[s]
in [their] entirety and had
<SPage 558>
cross-examined the witnesses about the
reward and recantation.... The petitioner
... failed to prove how any additional
information, if it did exist, about the reward
or recantation would have altered
Skyers' defense strategy or impeachment
strategy. The petitioner [also] provided no
testimony from the witnesses as to what
they would have said on cross-examination
about the reward or the recantation. In
sum, the petitioner ... offered no evidence
proving that a different cross-examination
of O'Grinc or A, B, and C would have
altered the jury's verdict." (Citation omitted.)
Id. at 555-56, 124 A.3d 1.

<P20>This court also concluded that the habeas
court did not abuse its discretion in
denying the petition for certification to
appeal with respect to the petitioner's
claim in the first habeas appeal that
Skyers performed deficiently by failing to
adequately cross-examine the witnesses at
the petitioner's criminal trial regarding either
the reward or the recantation. Id. at
556, 124 A.3d 1. In doing so, this court
stated that, because "the habeas court
made no findings as to [whether] Skyers
knew about the recantation when O'Grinc
testified at the petitioner's trial, and the
petitioner did not seek an articulation from
the habeas court, we assume for the purposes
of this claim that Skyers knew about
the recantation at the time that O'Grinc
testified at the petitioner's trial. Assuming
that Skyers knew of the recantation,
Skyers offered a strategic, plausible reason
for not utilizing that line of impeachment.
On the basis of Skyers' testimony
and other evidence, the habeas court found
that it was a strategic decision not to
cross-examine O'Grinc about the recantation;
had Skyers cross-examined O'Grinc
about the recantation, Satti would have
been able to introduce harmful rehabilitation
evidence, negating the benefit of the
cross-examination. Thus, we must defer, as
the habeas court did, to Skyers' informed,
strategic decision.
<SPage 559>

<P20>"We similarly must defer to Skyers'
strategic decision not to cross-examine A,
B, and C about the state's offer of a reward.
The habeas court made no findings
of fact as to when Skyers became aware of
the reward, and the record is ambiguous.
In light of this ambiguity, we assume for
the purposes of this claim that Skyers
knew of the reward at the petitioner's
probable cause hearing, when he first
could have cross-examined C about the
<Page 395>
reward. The habeas court found that the
testimony of Satti and Skyers was credible
that the rehabilitation evidence was more
harmful than the potential benefit of the
cross-examinations. Thus, Skyers made an
informed, strategic decision not to cross-examine
the witnesses about the reward."
Id. at 557-58, 124 A.3d 1.

<P20>Following this court's dismissal of the
petitioner's appeal in the first habeas action,
the petitioner commenced a second
habeas action, which is the subject of this
appeal. In his operative second amended
habeas petition in the second habeas action,
the petitioner initially asserted three
counts: count one, alleging ineffective assistance
of Skyers at his criminal trial;
count two, alleging ineffective assistance of
McIntyre at his first habeas trial; and
count three, alleging prosecutorial impropriety
on the basis of a violation of <EM>Brady</EM>
v. <EM>Maryland,</EM> 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct.
1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). At the
commencement of the second habeas trial,
the court dismissed count one on the
ground of res judicata and because it was
successive of the claim of ineffective assistance
of trial counsel in the first habeas
action. The petitioner withdrew count
three and any claims relating to <EM>Brady,</EM>
which included a claim raised in paragraph
30 (d) of count two. The case, thus, proceeded
to trial on count two only as it
pertained to the claim of ineffective assistance
of McIntyre, which alleged that
McIntyre was ineffective for failing to pursue
an ineffective assistance of counsel
claim against Skyers for Skyers' failure (1)
to utilize trial transcripts
<SPage 560>
from Zapata's
trial in order to cross-examine witnesses
concerning inconsistencies in statements
made by witnesses and the reward offered
in the case, and (2) to make an adequate
investigation of the Zapata trial transcripts
in order to fully construct a defense at the
petitioner's criminal trial and/or probable
cause hearing. The focus of the petitioner's
ineffective assistance of counsel claim
against McIntyre in count two concerns
McIntyre's failure to utilize the trial transcripts
from Zapata's criminal trial in the
petitioner's first habeas trial.

<P20>At the second habeas trial, which took
place on June 15, 2022, the petitioner's
counsel entered into evidence the transcripts
of the petitioner's criminal trial,
Zapata's criminal trial, and the petitioner's
first habeas trial. The respondent did not
enter any exhibits into evidence, and only
one witness&mdash;McIntyre&mdash;testified. Following
the trial, the court issued a memorandum
of decision granting the petitioner's
second amended habeas petition. The court
concluded that the petitioner satisfied his
burden of proving that McIntyre's performance
at the first habeas trial was deficient
and that the petitioner was prejudiced
by McIntyre's deficient performance.
Specifically, the court concluded that
McIntyre was deficient for not presenting
the Zapata transcripts into evidence at the
first habeas trial and that Skyers performed
deficiently by conducting an incomplete
and flawed investigation and failing
to cross-examine A, B, and C about their
knowledge of the reward.

<P20>The court also concluded that the petitioner
was prejudiced by those deficiencies
because "critical impeachment evidence
was not presented." The court explained
that, "[h]ad McIntyre introduced the Zapata
trial transcripts, the first habeas court
would have had evidence of the eyewitnesses'
testimony that was available for
Skyers to adequately represent the petitioner
at trial&mdash;specifically, to prepare for
effective cross-examination
<SPage 561>
of the eyewitnesses.
Had McIntyre introduced Zapata's
trial transcripts, he would have demonstrated
to the [first habeas] court that if
Skyers had obtained and familiarized himself
with O'Grinc's testimony, Skyers too
would have gleaned from the transcripts
<Page 396>
that O'Grinc was an admitted liar and was
not a credible witness. Furthermore,
McIntyre would have shown the first habeas
court that Skyers would have had
knowledge of the fact that O'Grinc's testimony
at Zapata's trial did not inculpate
[the petitioner]. Additionally, McIntyre
would have demonstrated to the first habeas
court that had Skyers familiarized himself
with the transcripts he would have
been prepared to effectively cross-examine
O'Grinc about his recantation when he testified
at [the petitioner's] criminal trial."<fnr9>
The second habeas court concluded: "But
for McIntyre's failure to introduce the
transcripts from Zapata's trial into evidence,
there is a reasonable probability
that the outcome of the first habeas proceeding
would have been different because
[the petitioner] would have demonstrated
both deficient performance by Skyers and
that he was prejudiced thereby. The evidence
presented to this court undermines
confidence in the outcome of [the petitioner's]
criminal trial."
<SPage 562>

<P20>After the second habeas court rendered
judgment granting the second
amended habeas petition, the respondent,
on the granting of certification, appealed
to this court. Additional facts and procedural
history will be set forth as necessary.

<P20>Before we address the respondent's
claim on appeal, we set forth our standard
of review of a habeas court's judgment on
ineffective assistance of counsel claims,
which is well settled. "In a habeas appeal,
this court cannot disturb the underlying
facts found by the habeas court unless
they are clearly erroneous, but our review
of whether the facts as found by the habeas
court constituted a violation of the petitioner's
constitutional right to effective assistance
of counsel is plenary....

<P20>"In <EM>Strickland</EM> v. <EM>Washington,</EM> [466 U.S.
668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674
(1984)], the United States Supreme Court
established that for a petitioner to prevail
on a claim of ineffective assistance of
counsel, he must show that counsel's assistance
was so defective as to require reversal
of [the] conviction.... That requires
the petitioner to show (1) that counsel's
performance was deficient and (2) that the
deficient performance prejudiced the defense
.... Unless a [petitioner] makes
both showings, it cannot be said that the
conviction ... resulted from a breakdown
in the adversary process that renders the
result unreliable.... Because both prongs
... must be established for a habeas petitioner
to prevail, a court may dismiss a
petitioner's claim if he fails to meet either
prong....
<Page 397>

<P20>"To satisfy the performance prong
of the <EM>Strickland</EM> test, the petitioner must
demonstrate that his attorney's representation
was not reasonably competent or
within the range of competence displayed
by lawyers with ordinary training and skill
in the criminal law.... [A]
<SPage 563>
court must
indulge a strong presumption that counsel's
conduct falls within the wide range of
reasonable professional assistance; that is,
the [petitioner] must overcome the presumption
that, under the circumstances,
the challenged action might be considered
sound trial strategy....

<P20>"With respect to the prejudice
component of the <EM>Strickland</EM> test, the petitioner
must demonstrate that counsel's errors
were so serious as to deprive the
[petitioner] of a fair trial, a trial whose
result is reliable.... It is not enough for
the [petitioner] to show that the errors
had some conceivable effect on the out-come
of the proceedings.... Rather, [t]he
[petitioner] must show that there is a reasonable
probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of the
proceeding would have been different. A
reasonable probability is a probability sufficient
to undermine confidence in the out-come....

<P20>"It is axiomatic that courts may
decide against a petitioner on either prong
[of the <EM>Strickland</EM> test], whichever is easier
.... [T]he petitioner's failure to prove
either [the performance prong or the prejudice
prong] is fatal to a habeas petition....
[A] court need not determine
whether counsel's performance was deficient
before examining the prejudice suffered
by the defendant as a result of the
alleged deficiencies.... If it is easier to
dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the

<P20>"The use of a habeas petition to
raise an ineffective assistance of habeas
counsel claim, commonly referred to as a
habeas on a habeas, was approved by our
Supreme Court in <EM>Lozada</EM> v. <EM>Warden,</EM> 223

To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance

the <EM>Strickland</EM> [v. <EM>Washington,</EM> supra, 466
U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052] standard requires
the petitioner to demonstrate that
his prior habeas counsel's performance
was ineffective and that this ineffectiveness
prejudiced the petitioner's prior habeas
proceeding.... [T]he petitioner will
have to prove that one or both of the prior
habeas counsel, in presenting his claims,
was ineffective and that effective representation
by habeas counsel establishes a reasonable
probability that the habeas court
would have found that he was entitled to
reversal of the conviction and a new trial

A.3d 78 (2022).

<P20>In the present case, the respondent
challenges only the habeas court's finding
that the petitioner established that he was
prejudiced by McIntyre's allegedly deficient
performance. We, therefore, do not
address the performance prong of <EM>Strickland</EM>
and focus our analysis on the issue of
prejudice, which is dispositive of this
<SPage 565>
appeal. See <EM>James P.</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 224 Conn. App. 636, 645, 312
A.3d 1132, cert. denied, 349 Conn. 911, 314
A.3d 603 (2024).

<P20>On appeal, the respondent claims
that the habeas court improperly determined
that the petitioner satisfied his
heavy burden of demonstrating prejudice.
Specifically, the respondent argues that,
"[e]ven if McIntyre's decision to forgo submitting
the Zapata transcripts into evidence
fell below prevailing professional
norms, it is not reasonably probable that
the outcome of the petitioner's first habeas
trial would have been different...." This
is so, according to the respondent, because
the petitioner never presented testimony
at the second habeas trial from A, B, C,
and O'Grinc concerning what they would
have said if cross-examined by Skyers at
the petitioner's criminal trial about the
reward or the recantation and, without
such testimony, the second habeas court's
finding of prejudice was based on speculation.
The respondent argues further that
the second habeas court, without ever seeing
A, B, C, or O'Grinc, improperly assessed
the witnesses' credibility and assumed
that a jury would not have believed
those witnesses if they had testified at the
petitioner's criminal trial consistent with
their testimony at Zapata's trial. We
agree.

<P20>Because our resolution of the claim on
appeal requires us to review the Zapata
transcripts, we first set forth the following
additional facts regarding the testimony of
A, B, C, and O'Grinc at Zapata's criminal
trial. During Zapata's criminal trial, A, B,
and C each were questioned on cross-examination
about the reward that was offered
concerning the victim's murder.
When A was asked if she was aware that
there was a reward in the case, she responded,
"[t]hat has nothing to do with
me." She further testified that she was not
previously aware of the reward and had
just become aware of it while she was
testifying. She was asked
<SPage 566>
multiple times
if she ever heard of the reward previously,
each time responding in the negative. B
similarly testified that she did not know
that there was a reward offered in the
case. That prompted Zapata's attorney to
ask: "So, what did you come in here for,
out of the kindness of your heart?" B
replied: "No, I didn't come here from the
kindness of my heart; it's that somebody
[saw me at the scene of the shooting]
before it happened.... Other than that, I
wouldn't be here." C testified that she did
not find out about the reward until "later
on" and that she was "not really interested
about the money...." When asked repeatedly
if she was trying or expecting to
get a portion of the reward, she responded
"no" each time. On redirect examination, C
testified that she did not have any knowledge
of the reward prior to contacting the
police regarding the shooting.

<P20>O'Grinc testified that he had known the
petitioner and Zapata for a number of
years and that he was currently incarcerated.
When asked about a conversation he
had had while in a courthouse lockup with
Zapata and the petitioner, O'Grinc mentioned
that Zapata indicated that he was in
jail on a murder charge for a shooting that
took place on Pembroke Street and that
Zapata thought that he had his murder
case "beat...." When asked further
whether Zapata had made any statements
<Page 399>
to him about the details underlying the
murder charge, O'Grinc replied, "[n]ot specifically."
That prompted the prosecutor to
question O'Grinc about a prior written,
sworn statement he had made to the police
indicating otherwise. O'Grinc testified that
his statement to the police was not true
and that he had made it up. The court
subsequently allowed a redacted version of
the statement into evidence as a full exhibit,
and it was read to the jury. The redacted
statement provides in relevant part that
Zapata told O'Grinc that he killed the victim,
that Zapata had the case beat
<SPage 567>
because of lack of evidence, that Zapata
said he and the petitioner "went around
the car and shot the guy" at least fifteen
times, that Zapata said that he and the
petitioner "shot the guy" on Pembroke
Street, and that the petitioner "was standing
right there when [Zapata] was saying
how he shot the guy." With respect to the
redactions, the court precluded the jury in
the Zapata trial from hearing anything
about how the petitioner responded in response
to Zapata's statements while in the
courthouse lockup.

<P20>With this background in mind, we turn
to the sole issue raised in the petition for
certification to appeal, namely, whether
the second habeas court properly determined
that the petitioner established that
he was prejudiced by McIntyre's alleged
ineffective assistance for failing to present
the Zapata transcripts at the first habeas
trial. In other words, the question before
this court is whether the second habeas
court properly determined that there was
a reasonable probability that, if McIntyre
had submitted the Zapata transcripts into
evidence at the petitioner's first habeas
trial, the outcome of the first habeas trial
would have been different. See, e.g., <EM>White</EM>
v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra, 209
Conn. App. at 152, 164, 267 A.3d 289;
<EM>Edward M.</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
186 Conn. App. 754, 767, 201 A.3d 492
(2018).

<P20>On the basis of our plenary review
of the record before the second habeas
court, we conclude that the court improperly
determined that the petitioner met his
heavy burden of establishing that he was
prejudiced by the allegedly deficient performance
of McIntyre. The primary basis
for our conclusion stems from the fact that
the petitioner did not present A, B, C,<fnr10> or
O'Grinc
<SPage 568>
as witnesses at his second habeas
trial, and he did not offer any evidence
concerning how those witnesses would
have testified had they been cross-examined
about the reward and the recantation
at the petitioner's criminal trial or his
probable cause hearing. "It is axiomatic
that a habeas petitioner who claims prejudice
based on counsel's alleged failure to
present helpful evidence from a particular
witness, must call that witness to testify
before the habeas court or otherwise prove
what the witness would or could have stated
had he been questioned at trial, as the
petitioner claims he should have been."

45 Conn. App. 242, 247-48, 695
A.2d 20 (habeas court correctly determined
that petitioner presented insufficient
proof of prejudice when petitioner
did not call witnesses to testify at habeas
trial and, thus, did not establish that their
testimony at criminal trial would have
been favorable to him), cert. denied, 242
Conn. 910, 697 A.2d 364 (1997).

<P20>For example, in <EM>Thomas</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 141 Conn. App. 465, 466-67,
472, 62 A.3d 534, cert. denied, 308
Conn. 939, 66 A.3d 881 (2013), the petitioner
alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective
in failing to call a certain witness to
testify at the petitioner's criminal trial.
The petitioner, however, did not present
testimony from that witness at his habeas
trial. Id. at 472, 62 A.3d 534. The habeas
court therefore determined that the petitioner
failed to show that he was prejudiced
by his counsel's failure to call the
witness to testify at the
<SPage 569>
criminal trial,
and this court affirmed that decision on
appeal. Id. In doing so, we stated: "[T]he
failure of defense counsel to call a potential
witness does not constitute ineffective assistance
unless there is some showing that
the testimony would have been helpful in
establishing the asserted defense." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) Id. Because
the petitioner in <EM>Thomas</EM> did not call the
witness to testify at the habeas trial, this
court concluded that "it [was] thus not
possible to find that [the witness'] testimony
at the criminal trial would have aided
the petitioner. More fundamentally, without
[the witness'] testimony at the habeas
trial, it [was] not discernible whether he
would have testified in accordance with his
initial, exculpatory statement to the police
or if he would have admitted that he had
fabricated that statement as he did on the
eve of trial. Without his testimony, the
habeas court could not evaluate him as a
witness, nor could it assess the likely impact
of his testimony." Id.

<P20>Likewise, in the present case, without
the testimony of A, B, and C at the second
habeas trial, it is not possible to discern
whether A, B, or C would have testified in
accordance with their testimony at Zapata's
trial, in which each one denied having
knowledge of the reward prior to speaking
with the police, or if any one of them
would have testified to the contrary. There
is also no way of knowing how O'Grinc
would have responded to questions about
his recantation.<fnr11> Furthermore, the Zapata
transcripts do not contain information
about the financial circumstances of A, B,
or C, and they do not contain testimony
supporting an inference that A, B, or C
testified against the petitioner at his criminal
trial or probable cause hearing in order
to
<SPage 570>
receive a portion of the reward money.<fnr12>
Consequently, without their testimony
at the second habeas trial, it was not
possible for the habeas court to evaluate
the strength of any testimony they would
have offered had they been cross-examined
about the reward or recantation, and the
court could not assess the likely impact of
their testimony or whether the testimony
of any of these witnesses at the criminal
<Page 401>
trial would have aided the petitioner. See,
e.g., id. at 472-73, 62 A.3d 534.

<P20>Nevertheless, the second habeas court
did, in effect, assess the impact of any
testimony the witnesses might have offered
on cross-examination when it concluded
that the petitioner was prejudiced
by "the inability to effectively cross-examine
[the] four witnesses and [show] either
their motivations for testifying or undermining
credibility," as the presumption underlying
that conclusion is that the credibility
of the witnesses would have been
impeached, and a pecuniary motive for
their testimony would have been established,
by cross-examination regarding the
reward and recantation. In essence, the
court found that a cross-examination of
these witnesses would have been beneficial
to the petitioner, despite not knowing what
the witnesses would have testified to if
they had been questioned about the reward
and recantation. For example, the
second habeas court "gave weight to [the
petitioner's] argument that, `[e]ven if [the
eyewitnesses] all denied coming forward
for the reward money, by introducing that
information, Skyers would have highlighted
to the jury that each of the witnesses
had a <EM>compelling motive</EM> for testifying.'"
(Emphasis added.) It also concluded
<SPage 571>
that the petitioner was prejudiced because
"<EM>critical</EM> impeachment evidence was
not presented." (Emphasis added.) The
compelling or critical nature of any such
impeachment evidence, however, had not
been established.<fnr13> The petitioner's case in
the second habeas trial thus suffers from
the same fundamental problem that existed
at his first habeas trial&mdash;no live testimony
from A, B, C, or O'Grinc "as to what
they would have said on cross-examination
about the reward or recantation"&mdash;without
which this court in the prior appeal agreed
with the first habeas court's conclusion
that the petitioner had not established
prejudice. <EM>Taft</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
supra, 159 Conn. App. at 554, 124
A.3d 1; see also <EM>Jones</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of
Correction,</EM> supra, 212 Conn. App. at 131-32,
274 A.3d 237; <EM>Thomas</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> supra, 141 Conn. App. at
472, 62 A.3d 534; <EM>Andrews</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> supra, 45 Conn. App. at
247-48, 695 A.2d 20.

<P20>We, thus, conclude that the second
habeas court improperly speculated about
the prejudicial nature of any testimony
that might have been elicited from the
witnesses on cross-examination concerning
the reward and recantation. As this court
has stated previously, a petitioner cannot
meet his burden of demonstrating fundamental
unfairness or prejudice by speculation;
it must be proved by "demonstrable
realities." (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

(2010); see also <EM>Skakel</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of
Correction,</EM> 329 Conn. 1, 40, 188 A.3d 1

<SPage 572>
result must be substantial, not just conceivable"
(internal quotation marks omitted)),
cert. denied, 586 U.S. 1068, 139 S.
Ct. 788, 202 L. Ed. 2d 569 (2019).

<P20>Additionally, the second habeas
court, in making those presumptions about
the witnesses' credibility, improperly assessed
the credibility of witnesses who
never testified at the second habeas trial.
"It is generally inappropriate for the trier
<Page 402>
of fact to assess the witness' credibility
without having watched the witness testify
under oath." <EM>Santos</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of
Correction,</EM> 186 Conn. App. 107, 116, 198
A.3d 698, cert. denied, 330 Conn. 955, 197
A.3d 893 (2018); see also <EM>Tang</EM> v. <EM>Bou-Fakhreddine,</EM>
75 Conn. App. 334, 352, 815
A.2d 1276 (2003) ("Credibility must be assessed
... by observing firsthand the witness'
conduct, demeanor and attitude....
As a practical matter, it is inappropriate to
assess credibility without having watched a
witness testify, because demeanor, conduct
and other factors are not fully reflected in
the cold, printed record." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.)).

<P20>Because A, B, C, and O'Grinc were not
called as witnesses at the second habeas
trial, the second habeas court impermissibly
speculated as to their possible testimony
and improperly assessed their credibility.
Accordingly, without live testimony
from A, B, C, or O'Grinc at the second
habeas trial, we conclude that the second
habeas court improperly determined that
the petitioner met his burden of showing
the existence of a reasonable probability
that the decision reached by the first habeas
court would have been different if
McIntyre had introduced the Zapata transcripts
at the first habeas trial.

<P20>We also do not agree with the
second habeas court that the Zapata transcripts,
alone, are sufficient to undermine
confidence in the outcome of the petitioner's
<SPage 573>
criminal trial. The second habeas
court's finding of prejudice is predicated,
in part, on its determination that "[t]he
Zapata transcripts [were] rife with negative
information about both [B] and
[A].... Skyers could have combined such
negative information with the likely financial
gain from the reward money to highlight
their motive for testifying for the
state, and to cast doubt on their credibility."
Specifically, the second habeas court
stated: "[H]ad Skyers familiarized himself
with Zapata's trial transcripts, he would
have had knowledge that B testified to
smoking angel dust and marijuana during
the time of August to September, 2001."
The court also stated: "Additionally, [B's]
testimony at Zapata's trial conflicted with
her statement to Detective [Heitor] Texeira.
[B] confirmed on cross-examination
that she did not tell Detective Texeira that
she saw [the petitioner] at the crime
scene." With respect to O'Grinc, the second
habeas court found that, if Skyers had
obtained and reviewed the Zapata transcripts,
he would have been aware of
O'Grinc's recantation and would have
known that O'Grinc was an admitted liar,
that he lied in his statement to the police
to get a benefit regarding criminal charges
pending against him, that he testified at
the petitioner's criminal trial to benefit
himself, and that O'Grinc's testimony at
Zapata's trial did not inculpate the petitioner.

<P20>The transcripts from the petitioner's
criminal trial, however, show that Skyers
did utilize negative information similar to
that which was in the Zapata transcripts
during his cross-examinations of A and B,
with the exception of the reward. For example,
at the petitioner's criminal trial, B
was questioned about the drugs that she
was using at the time of the shooting and
testified that, on the night of the shooting,
she bought marijuana that was "laced,"
which she called "purple haze," because
there was no "angel dust" available to buy.
<SPage 574>
Skyers also cross-examined B regarding
her prior inconsistent statement to Detective
Texeira, in which she never mentioned
that the petitioner was at the scene of the
shooting that night. Similarly, Skyers did
cross-examine A regarding her prior drug
dealing and felony convictions, as well as
her prior inconsistent statement to the police
and the fact that she was "being forced
<Page 403>
to testify under the fear of being held in
contempt...." See footnote 5 of this opinion.
With respect to O'Grinc, Skyers did
elicit, through cross-examination of
O'Grinc at the petitioner's criminal trial,
that O'Grinc wanted to get some kind of
benefit from talking with the police about
the shooting death of the victim and that
O'Grinc spoke with the police for self-serving
reasons, namely, to take care of himself.
Although, when Skyers asked O'Grinc
if he would lie under oath, O'Grinc replied
that he would not, the jury had to assess
that answer in light of the fact that
O'Grinc was a convicted felon and a jailhouse
informant.<fnr14>

<P20>Finally, we note that the first habeas
court credited testimony from Satti and
Skyers at the first habeas trial
<SPage 575>
that, if
the witnesses had been cross-examined
about the reward and the recantation,
"Satti would have been able to rehabilitate
them on redirect examination with evidence
damaging to the petitioner";<fnr15> <EM>Taft</EM>
v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra, 159
Conn. App. at 555, 124 A.3d 1; and that the
rehabilitation evidence would have been
more harmful than any benefit received
from cross-examinations about the reward
and the recantation. See <EM>Barlow</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 343 Conn. 347,
357, 273 A.3d 680 (2022) ("[b]ecause it is
the [habeas] court's function to weigh the
evidence and determine credibility, [a reviewing
court gives] great deference to its
findings" (internal quotation marks omitted));
<EM>Bowens</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
333 Conn. 502, 523, 217 A.3d 609
<Page 404>
(2019) ("habeas court is the sole arbiter of
the credibility of witnesses and the weight
to be given to their testimony"). The second
habeas court, however, did not defer
to the first habeas court's assessment of
the credibility of the witnesses who testified
at the first habeas trial, which factored
into the first habeas court's decision
to deny the petitioner's claim that Skyers
performed deficiently in failing to adequately
cross-examine witnesses at the petitioner's
criminal trial. When
<SPage 576>
we take
into consideration the first habeas court's
finding that Skyers had made an informed,
strategic decision not to cross-examine
O'Grinc about the recantation and A, B,
and C about the reward, we are hard-pressed
to find a reasonable probability
that the first habeas court would have
made a different decision if it had been
able to review the Zapata transcripts.

<P20>As we stated previously in this
opinion, in cases involving a habeas on a
habeas, a petitioner must demonstrate ineffective
assistance by both prior habeas
counsel and trial counsel. See <EM>Hilton</EM> v.
<EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 225 Conn.
App. 309, 328, 315 A.3d 1135 (2024). Thus,
the petitioner's claim that his prior habeas
counsel provided ineffective assistance
must fail "if the claim of ineffective assistance
of his trial counsel ... is without
merit." Id. at 329, 315 A.3d 1135. "Simply
put, a petitioner cannot succeed ... on a
claim that his habeas counsel was ineffective
by failing to raise a claim against trial
counsel ... unless the petitioner ultimately
will be able to demonstrate that the
claim against trial ... counsel would have
had a reasonable probability of success if
raised." (Internal quotation marks omitted.)
Id. at 328, 315 A.3d 1135. In the
present case, the first habeas court rejected
the petitioner's claim that Skyers performed
deficiently by failing to cross-examine
the witnesses about the reward and
recantation and, instead, found, on the basis
of its credibility assessment of Skyers'
testimony, that Skyers had made a reasonable,
strategic decision not to do so, and
this court in the first habeas appeal similarly
deferred to Skyers' "informed tactical
decisions" that those lines of impeachment
would not have been fruitful. <EM>Taft</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> supra, 159 Conn.
App. at 556, 558, 124 A.3d 1. In light of the
foregoing, we conclude that the petitioner
has not established that there is a reasonable
probability that the outcome of his
first habeas trial would have been different
because he cannot show that the first habeas
court, which found
<SPage 577>
that Skyers had
made a reasonable, strategic decision not
to cross-examine A, B, C, and O'Grinc
about the reward and recantation, would
have changed its determination that
Skyers did not perform deficiently in that
respect had it viewed the Zapata transcripts.<fnr16>

<P20>Accordingly, we disagree with the second
habeas court's conclusion that the petitioner
satisfied his burden of establishing
that he was prejudiced by McIntyre's failure
to introduce the Zapata transcripts
into evidence at the first habeas trial. The
evidence presented by the petitioner at the
second habeas trial does not demonstrate
the existence of a reasonable probability
<Page 405>
that the outcome of the first habeas trial
would have been different had McIntyre
done so. The second habeas court, therefore,
improperly granted the petitioner's
second amended petition for a writ of habeas
corpus.

<P20>The judgment is reversed and the case
is remanded with direction to deny the
petitioner's second amended petition for a
writ of habeas corpus.

<P20>In this opinion the other judges
concurred.

testified that she had seen the [petitioner]
with Zapata, Bermudez and Michael Cooney."
<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Taft,</EM> supra, 306 Conn. at 754
n.8, 51 A.3d 988.

<fnt5> During the petitioner's criminal trial, A was
questioned regarding a written statement she
had provided to the Bridgeport police in July,
2002, in which she did not inform the police
what she had seen on the night of the shooting
and, instead, indicated that she, the petitioner,
Zapata, and Bermudez were at 639
Barnum Avenue when the shooting occurred.
She also was questioned about a second written
statement she had provided to the police
in December, 2005, which was substantially
different from the first one but which was
consistent with her trial testimony that, on the
night of the shooting, Zapata and the petitioner,
with guns in their hands, walked past
where she was sitting and started shooting at
the victim. When asked why she had changed
her story, A responded: "Because I couldn't
take this no more. I couldn't take it. The
police was harassing me. They was harassing
my children, my mother, my father. They was
raiding my house. They was raiding my sisters'
houses. I was being dragged to jail. I
couldn't take it no more." A testified further
that, as a result of having witnessed the shooting,
she had trouble sleeping because she kept
dreaming about the shooting and reliving it,
including hearing the victim's screams as he
was being shot. A acknowledged that she was
in court testifying because she had "no
choice," as she had been brought to court to
testify pursuant to a capias warrant.

<fnt6> C testified at the petitioner's probable cause
hearing but was unavailable to testify at the
petitioner's criminal trial due to medical issues.
Her prior sworn testimony from the
probable cause hearing was read into the
record at the petitioner's criminal trial.

<fnt7> O'Grinc's name, which was sealed at the
time of the petitioner's direct appeal, is no
longer sealed. See <EM>Taft</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of
Correction,</EM> 159 Conn. App. 537, 542 n.3, 124
A.3d 1, cert. denied, 320 Conn. 910, 128 A.3d
954 (2015).

<fnt8> "At the habeas trial, Skyers could not recollect
if he knew about the reward at the probable
cause hearing. The habeas court made no
specific finding regarding whether Skyers
knew, at the time of the petitioner's criminal
trial, that O'Grinc had recanted his statement
to the police." <EM>Taft</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
supra, 159 Conn. App. at 546 n.4, 124
A.3d 1.

<fnt9> On the issue of O'Grinc's recantation, the
second habeas court concluded: "If Skyers
had obtained and reviewed Zapata's trial
transcripts, he would have known that
O'Grinc admitted under oath that he lied to
the police in his prior statement.... Skyers
would have been aware that O'Grinc testified
that he lied and made up the statement because
he wanted to get a benefit&mdash;help with
the pending charges against him, [and] so he
told the detectives what he thought they wanted
to hear.... Skyers' failure to obtain and
familiarize himself with the transcripts deprived
the [the petitioner's] jury of important
impeachment evidence that O'Grinc recanted
his prior statement when he testified under
oath at Zapata's trial only a few months earlier....
Had Skyers obtained and familiarized
himself with the transcripts of O'Grinc's recantation,
Skyers would have been able to use
O'Grinc's own testimony to demonstrate bias
and show that O'Grinc was only testifying,
including falsely, at [the petitioner's] trial for
his own benefit. Skyers acknowledged on
cross-examination that if he had brought out
O'Grinc's recantation, the state would have
rehabilitated O'Grinc using the prior statement.
Even if the state was able to use the
prior statement on redirect, credibility damage
would have already been done by Skyers'
cross-examination about the recantation."

<fnt10> As we stated previously in this opinion, C
did not testify in person at the petitioner's
criminal trial; rather, her testimony from the
petitioner's probable cause hearing was read
to the jury. The second amended habeas petition
alleges ineffective assistance by McIntyre
for his failure to pursue an ineffective assistance
of counsel claim against Skyers for
Skyers' failure to utilize the Zapata transcripts
to cross-examine witnesses during the
petitioner's criminal trial and/or the probable
cause hearing. Thus, although Skyers could
not have cross-examined C at the petitioner's
criminal trial concerning the reward, the operative
habeas petition appears to allege that
Skyers should have done so with respect to C
at the probable cause hearing. For that reason,
we include C in our analysis of the issue
of prejudice.

<fnt11> We are mindful "that courts universally
view recantation evidence with a healthy dose
of skepticism." <EM>Gould</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
301 Conn. 544, 568, 22 A.3d 1196
(2011).

<fnt12> In fact, despite the existence of the reward,
A did not want to testify and had to be
brought to court pursuant to a capias warrant,
which undermines any argument that
she was there for pecuniary gain. Therefore,
the second habeas court's finding that the jury
in the petitioner's criminal trial could have
inferred, from a cross-examination of A about
the reward, that she had a financial motive to
testify favorably for the state is not supported
by the record and is clearly erroneous.

<fnt13> On appeal, the petitioner argues that the
mere existence of a reward in a case warrants
a presumption that the reward is the motivating
factor for the witness' testimony, regardless
of whether the witness even knew about
the reward. The petitioner's argument, however,
is not substantiated by evidence in the
record, including the Zapata transcripts, and
the petitioner has not cited any case law to
support this claim.

<fnt14> We note that, even if Skyers had been able
to impeach O'Grinc through questioning
about his recantation and the fact that
O'Grinc testified at Zapata's trial that he lied
in his sworn statement to the police, such that
the jury would not have found O'Grinc's testimony
credible or believable, the state also
presented testimony from D, another jailhouse
informant, whose testimony was similar
to that of O'Grinc. Specifically, D "testified
that he was incarcerated in the same
prison as the [petitioner], and that the [petitioner]
had told him that he and Zapata had
shot a `dude' in a Honda seven times with a
.45 caliber gun. D then recounted that the
[petitioner] had told him that he and Zapata
had chased after the victim because they
wanted to take the victim's jewelry." <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>Taft,</EM> supra, 306 Conn. at 755, 51 A.3d 988.
Thus, the record contains testimony from another
jailhouse informant to the same effect
as that of O'Grinc, that is, that the petitioner
acknowledged his involvement in the shooting.
The existence of similar testimony in the
record from another jailhouse informant diminishes
the likelihood that a cross-examination
of O'Grinc about his recantation would
have had a substantial effect on the result of
the criminal trial. See <EM>Skakel</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> supra, 329 Conn. at 40, 188
A.3d 1; <EM>Edward M.</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
supra, 186 Conn. App. at 767, 201 A.3d
492.

<fnt15> For example, Satti testified at the first habeas
trial that he would have tried to introduce
into evidence the prior consistent statement
made by O'Grinc to the police, which
would have provided confirmation of
O'Grinc's testimony at the petitioner's criminal
trial that the petitioner was present when
Zapata made the comments about how the
two of them killed the victim. If O'Grinc had
been cross-examined about his recantation,
there also was a reasonable concern of opening
the door to harmful rehabilitation questioning
by Satti, who "would have shown that
the petitioner, Zapata, and O'Grinc had a
prior history, including alleged participation
in the same drug operation and a familial
relationship between Zapata and O'Grinc."
<EM>Taft</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra, 159
Conn. App. at 555, 124 A.3d 1. Additionally,
"A, B, and C would have testified to having
other motives for testifying at the criminal
trial other than the reward&mdash;C was motivated
to testify by almost being killed in the past for
being thought as a snitch in the present case;
B was motivated to testify by fear as Zapata
had tried to murder her in the courtroom
during Zapata's trial; and A was motivated to
testify by being arrested and forced to testify
pursuant to a capias warrant." Id.

<fnt16> Although we recognize that the respondent
challenges only the second habeas court's
finding of prejudice, our analysis of the issue
on appeal necessarily must include an examination
of whether the petitioner's claim of
ineffective assistance of Skyers had a reasonable
probability of success. See <EM>Hilton</EM> v.
<EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra, 225 Conn.
App. at 328, 315 A.3d 1135; see also <EM>Kaddah</EM>

<P20>In this partition action, the plaintiff,
D. J., appeals from the judgment of the
trial court ordering the equitable distribution
of a parcel of real property jointly
owned by the plaintiff and the defendant
F. D.<fnr1>
<SPage 139>
and ordering the defendant to
<Page 408>
pay the plaintiff $2000 as just compensation
for his interest in the property pursuant
to General Statutes &sect; 52-500 (a).<fnr2> On
appeal, the plaintiff contends that the
court abused its discretion in determining
that (1) he had only a minimal interest in
the property and (2) the just compensation
owed to him for his interest in the property
was $2000. We disagree and, accordingly,
affirm the judgment of the trial court.

<P20>The following facts, as found by the trial
court or as are undisputed in the record,
and procedural history are relevant to our
resolution of this appeal. In 2015, the defendant
purchased certain real property in
North Franklin (property). The plaintiff
did not contribute financially to the purchase
of the property. The parties were
involved in a romantic relationship prior to
the purchase of the property, and, "[a]t
some point after the purchase, the plaintiff
moved into the home, as did the plaintiff's
son." The defendant was solely responsible
for the mortgage, taxes, and insurance,
and she made such payments. The plaintiff
contributed $400 per month toward groceries
and other household items during most
of the time that he lived with the defendant.
The court also found that the value
of the plaintiff's contribution toward the
maintenance of the property was $2000.

<P20>On November 27, 2017, the defendant
quitclaimed the property to the parties as
joint tenants with rights
<SPage 140>
of survivorship.
In 2019, the romantic relationship of the
parties ended, and the plaintiff moved
from the property, taking with him some
furnishings purchased by the defendant
and making no financial contributions toward
the property thereafter. The parties
stipulated that, at the time of trial, the fair
market value of the home was $280,000,
and the mortgage payoff was $132,000,
leaving $148,000 in equity.

<P20>On July 7, 2021, the plaintiff commenced
the present action against the defendant.
In his operative, two count, amended complaint
dated March 2, 2022, the plaintiff
sought (1) the partition of the property
pursuant to General Statutes &sect; 52-495 and
(2) an accounting and contribution from
the defendant for expenses related to the
property pursuant to the common law
and/or General Statutes &sect; 52-404 (b). On
September 1, 2022, the defendant filed an
answer, a special defense asserting bad
faith by the plaintiff, and a one count
counterclaim seeking an accounting and
contribution from the plaintiff for expenses
related to the property. On September 2,
2022, the plaintiff filed a reply denying the
allegations set forth in the defendant's special
defense, and, on March 22, 2023, the
plaintiff filed an answer to the defendant's
counterclaim.

<P20>On April 20, 2023, the matter was tried
to the court, <EM>Goodrow, J.</EM> The court heard
testimony from the plaintiff and the defendant
and admitted numerous exhibits into
evidence. Following the close of evidence,
the court asked the parties to state during
closing arguments "exactly what it is each
side is requesting the court to do in this
case." The plaintiff's counsel requested
<Page 409>
that the court order a partition by sale and
that the proceeds be split evenly between
the plaintiff and the defendant. The defendant's
counsel requested that the property
not be partitioned by sale and that any
required payment of just compensation to
the plaintiff in connection with the equitable
distribution of the property be minimal.
Thereafter, the parties filed posttrial
briefs.
<SPage 141>

<P20>On June 30, 2023, the court issued a
memorandum of decision ordering an equitable
distribution of the property and just
compensation to be paid to the plaintiff.
The court found "the defendant's testimony
generally credible" and "the plaintiff's
testimony not credible." More specifically,
the court expressly did not credit the
plaintiff's testimony that (1) "he paid
$60,000 toward the maintenance and upkeep
of the ... property," instead finding
that "the value of the plaintiff's contribution
to the maintenance of the property
was $2000," (2) "he paid the defendant
$4000 when he left the property," or (3) he
contributed $1000 on a monthly basis toward
property expenses, instead finding
that he paid the defendant $400 per month
for groceries and other household expenses
during most of the time while he
lived with the defendant and has made no
financial contribution toward the property
since he vacated it in 2019.<fnr3> The court
concluded, pursuant to &sect; 52-500 (a), that
"the plaintiff has only a minimal interest in
the
<SPage 142>
property and a sale would not promote
the interests of the parties as owners"
because "the defendant seeks to remain
in the property to provide stability
and security for herself and her family."<fnr4>
Accordingly, the court ordered that "[t]he
plaintiff shall transfer his interest in the
property by quitclaim deed to the defendant
by August 30, 2023, and that simultaneously
therewith, the defendant shall
transfer to the plaintiff the sum of [$2000]
as just compensation." On July 19, 2023,
the plaintiff filed a motion to reargue,
which the court denied. This appeal followed.

<P20>Before addressing the merits of the
plaintiff's claims on appeal, we begin by
setting forth the relevant language of the
partition statute at issue. Section 52-500,
titled in part "Sale or equitable distribution
of real or personal property owned by
two or more persons," provides in relevant
<Page 410>
part: "(a) Any court of equitable jurisdiction
may, upon the complaint of any person
interested, order the sale of any property,
real or personal, owned by two or
more persons, when, in the opinion of the
court, a sale will better promote the interests
of the owners. If the court determines
that one or more of the persons owning
such real or personal property have only a
minimal interest in such property and a
sale would not promote the interests of the
owners, the court may order such equitable
distribution of such property, with payment
of just compensation to the owners of
such minimal interest, as will better promote
the interests of the owners...." As
we discuss more fully in this opinion, the
statute was amended in 2004 to add the
final sentence of subsection (a)&mdash;to allow a
trial court, upon making the requisite findings,
to order equitable distribution of
property&mdash;instead of limiting the remedy
in a partition action to partition in
<SPage 143>
kind
or partition by sale (2004 amendment). See
Public Acts 2004, No. 04-93, &sect; 1 (P.A. 04-93).

<P20>Additionally, we recognize the
long-standing principle that "[a] partition
action is equitable in nature. Accordingly,
[t]he determination of what equity requires
is a matter for the discretion of the
trial court.... In determining whether the
trial court has abused its discretion, we
must make every reasonable presumption
in favor of the correctness of its action....
Our review of a trial court's exercise of the
... discretion vested in it is limited to the
questions of whether the trial court correctly
applied the law and could reasonably
have reached the conclusion that it
did." (Internal quotation marks omitted.)
<EM>DiCerto</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM> 108 Conn. App. 184, 188-89,
947 A.2d 409 (2008).

<CN>I

<P20>The plaintiff first claims that, in connection
with ordering the equitable distribution
of the property (as opposed to a partition
by sale, as he had requested), the trial
court abused its discretion in determining
that he had only a minimal interest in the
property for purposes of &sect; 52-500 (a).<fnr5>
Specifically, as clarified by the plaintiff's
counsel during oral argument before this
court, the plaintiff argues that, by virtue of
his 50 percent fee interest, as reflected in
the 2017 quitclaim deed alone, the court
erred in determining that he had only a
minimal interest. We disagree.

<P20>Resolving the plaintiff's claim requires
us to construe the term "minimal
interest," as set forth in &sect; 52-500 (a), to
determine whether it (1) relates solely to a
property owner's fee interest or (2) contemplates
consideration of any relevant
equitable factors in addition to that fee interest.
Thus, we are presented with a
question of
<SPage 144>
statutory interpretation over
which our review is plenary. See <EM>AAA
Advantage Carting & Demolition Service,
LLC</EM> v. <EM>Capone,</EM> 221 Conn. App. 256, 270,
301 A.3d 1111, cert. denied, 348 Conn. 924,
304 A.3d 442 (2023), and cert. denied, 348
Conn. 924, 304 A.3d 442 (2023). "When
construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective
is to ascertain and give effect to the
apparent intent of the legislature.... In
other words, we seek to determine, in a
reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory
language as applied to the facts of
[the] case, including the question of whether
the language actually does apply.... In
seeking to determine that meaning, General
Statutes &sect; 1-2z directs us first to consider
the text of the statute itself and its
relationship to other statutes. If, after examining
such text and considering such
<Page 411>
relationship, the meaning of such text is
plain and unambiguous and does not yield
absurd or unworkable results, extratextual
evidence of the meaning of the statute
shall not be considered.... When a statute
is not plain and unambiguous, we also
look for interpretive guidance to the legislative
history and circumstances surrounding
its enactment, to the legislative policy
it was designed to implement, and to its
relationship to existing legislation and
common law principles governing the same
general subject matter." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) Id.

<P20>"[M]inimal interest," as that
term is used in &sect; 52-500 (a), is not statutorily
defined, nor is either of the individual
terms "minimal" or, of most import, "interest."
See General Statutes &sect; 52-500 (a).
"Generally, in the absence of statutory definitions,
we look to the contemporaneous
dictionary definitions of words to ascertain
their commonly approved usage." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Wind Colebrook
South, LLC</EM> v. <EM>Colebrook,</EM> 344 Conn. 150,
164, 278 A.3d 442 (2022). At the time of the
2004 amendment, Merriam-Webster's
<SPage 145>
Collegiate Dictionary (Merriam-Webster)
defined "interest" as (1) a "right,
title, or legal share in something," (2) "participation
in advantage and responsibility,"
(3) "a charge for borrowed money generally
a percentage of the amount borrowed,"
(4) "the profit in goods or money that is
made on invested capital," and (5) "an
excess above what is due or expected...."
Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary
(11th Ed. 2003) p. 652. Black's Law
Dictionary contemporaneously defined "interest"
as (1) "[a]dvantage or profit, esp. of
a financial nature" and (2) "[a] legal share
in something; <EM>all or part of a legal or
equitable claim to or right in property.</EM>..."
(Emphasis added.) Black's Law Dictionary
(7th Ed. 1999) p. 816; see also
Black's Law Dictionary (8th Ed. 2004) p.
828 (same). Merriam-Webster also contemporaneously
defined "minimal" as "relating
to or being a minimum: as" (1) "the least
possible," (2) "barely adequate," and (3)
"very small or slight...." Merriam-Webster's
Collegiate Dictionary, supra, p. 791.

<P20>These definitions provide little, if any,
guidance in resolving whether the term
"minimal interest," as set forth in &sect; 52-500
(a), relates solely to a property owner's fee
interest or contemplates the consideration
of equitable factors in addition thereto.
Because we consider either interpretation
to be reasonable, we conclude that the
meaning of "minimal interest," for purposes
of &sect; 52-500 (a), is not plain and
unambiguous. See <EM>Gonzalez</EM> v. <EM>O & G Industries,
Inc.,</EM> 322 Conn. 291, 303, 140 A.3d
950 (2016) ("[t]he test to determine ambiguity
is whether the statute, when read in
context, is susceptible to more than one
reasonable interpretation" (internal quotation
marks omitted)).

<P20>Having concluded that the term "minimal
interest" is ambiguous, we turn to the
relatively scant legislative
<SPage 146>
history and
the circumstances surrounding the enactment
of the 2004 amendment to &sect; 52-500
(a) for guidance.<fnr6> See <EM>AAA Advantage
Carting & Demolition Service, LLC</EM> v. <EM>Capone,</EM>
supra, 221 Conn. App. at 270, 301
A.3d 1111. During a Judiciary Committee
hearing regarding the 2004 amendment,
Attorney Deborah Fuller, a representative
from the external affairs division of the
Judicial Branch, who appeared in support
<Page 412>
of Senate Bill No. 290, 2004 Sess., titled
"An Act Concerning Partition Actions,"
which was part of the Judicial Branch's
legislative package, testified that the 2004
amendment "would provide judges hearing
partition actions with more flexibility to
resolve those cases." Conn. Joint Standing
Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 4, 2004
Sess., p. 1174. In addition to the two possible
modes of relief then available to a trial
court in a partition action (i.e., partition in
kind and partition by sale), the 2004
amendment sought to provide a third
mode of relief, namely, the ability to order
&mdash;upon finding that one or more property
owners has only a "minimal interest"
in the property and that a sale of the
property would not promote the interest of
the owners&mdash;that a party's "minimal interest"
be bought out for just compensation in
exchange for a quitclaim deed. Id. This
third mode of relief, which already existed
in marital dissolution actions, was proposed
in direct response to a decision by
our Supreme Court in <EM>Fernandes</EM> v. <EM>Rodriguez,</EM>
255 Conn. 47, 761 A.2d 1283 (2000).
See Conn. Joint Standing Committee
Hearings, supra, p. 1174, remarks of Deborah
Fuller.

<P20>By way of background, in <EM>Fernandes,</EM>
the parties had purchased certain real
property and held title thereto as joint
tenants. <EM>Fernandes</EM> v. <EM>Rodriguez,</EM> supra,
255
<SPage 147>
Conn. at 49-50, 761 A.2d 1283. The
plaintiff brought a partition action, seeking
a partition in kind or, alternatively, a partition
by sale. Id., at 49, 761 A.2d 1283.
Following a trial, the trial court found that
the defendant's interest was minimal. Id.,
at 51-52, 761 A.2d 1283. In support thereof,
the court found that the defendant had
paid less than 7 percent of the down payment
toward the purchase of the property
and subsequently had contributed little or
nothing to the property. Id., at 51, 761
A.2d 1283. Whereupon the court found that
the defendant should recover (1) his net
share of certain rental proceeds, (2) the
amount he paid toward the closing costs,
and (3) 10 percent of the equity in the
property. Id. The court ordered that the
plaintiff pay the defendant a sum certain
and that the defendant execute and deliver
to the plaintiff a quitclaim deed relinquishing
his interest in the property. Id., at 52,
761 A.2d 1283. On appeal to this court, the
defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial
court had exceeded its authority in ordering
equitable distribution by payment of
money rather than ordering a partition by
sale or in kind. <EM>Fernandes</EM> v. <EM>Rodriguez,</EM> 54
Conn. App. 444, 445, 735 A.2d 871 (1999),
rev'd, 255 Conn. 47, 761 A.2d 1283 (2000).
We concluded that, based on the underlying
findings that "one owner had only a
minimal interest in the property and that
the other had a substantial interest and
resided on the property," the judgment
requiring the payment of money in exchange
for a conveyance of title was proper.
Id., at 453, 735 A.2d 871.

<P20>Our Supreme Court disagreed and held
that, in a partition action, pursuant to
&sect;&sect; 52-495 and 52-500, as those statutes
then existed, a trial court did not have the
equitable power to order, as relief, the
payment of money from one property owner
to another holding a minimal interest in
exchange for a quitclaim deed to the real
property. <EM>Fernandes</EM> v. <EM>Rodriguez,</EM> supra,
255 Conn. at 53-55, 761 A.2d 1283. Instead,
the court held that the trial court was
limited to the then existing statutory remedies
of partition in kind or partition by
sale. Id., at 57, 761 A.2d 1283.
<SPage 148>

<P20>With this judicial decision as the impetus
to the proposed legislation allowing
for the "equitable distribution of [the]
property, with payment of just compensation
to the owners of [a] minimal interest";
Senate Bill No. 290; when asked during
the previously mentioned Judiciary Committee
hearing by then Senator Andrew J.
<Page 413>
McDonald whether the Judicial Branch
was concerned "about how far the definition
of `minimal' might be taken," Attorney
Fuller replied: "[W]e think that the judges
can probably determine that.... I'm not
sure how you would statutorily define it, if
you tried to put something in the definition
as opposed to a case-by-case basis. I mean,
I don't know if you could put a percentage
on it.... I think that the judges would be
capable of making that determination...."
Conn. Joint. Standing Committee
Hearings, supra, p. 1175. Attorney Fuller
further testified that the interest involved
would not be limited to a property owner's
fee interest. See id.; see also id., p. 1176 ("I
think the judge would have to consider ...
if there were other factors, they would
have to consider that.... I think it would
be an equitable solution and ... they
would be looking at the whole picture, not
just the money that somebody put into it,
by any means.").

<P20>During the legislative debate in the Senate,
Senator McDonald stated that the
2004 amendment "allows further discretion
and opportunity for a judge of the Superior
Court to consider all of the merits and
equitable considerations of an action and
potentially avoiding needless expenses associated
with a partition sale." 47 S. Proc.,
Pt. 4, 2004 Sess., pp. 1130-31.

<P20>During the legislative debate in the
House of Representatives, in an exchange
with no other hypothetical facts provided,
Representative Robert M. Ward inquired
whether a "50 percent interest" is a "minimal
interest" under the 2004 amendment.
47 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7, 2004 Sess., p. 2026.
Representative Christopher R. Stone, who
<SPage 149>
moved for the bill's adoption; id., p.
2023; responded that "the definition of
minimal interest is not contained in the bill
and it would be determined by the court
under the totality of the circumstances."
Id., 2026. Representative Stone went on to
state: "[I]n my opinion ... [a] 50 percent
interest would not be a minimal interest
... and would most likely be handled in
another way, most likely a sale." Id. Representative
Ward then stated, "I just
thought it was important to get on the
record for legislative intent that minimal
interest was meant to be what the word
means in common English, a relatively
small interest." Id. Representative Ward
proceeded to convey his opinion that a 5
percent or 8 percent interest would be a
minimal interest, whereas a 35 percent or
a 50 percent interest would be "a substantial
interest...." Id., pp. 2026-27. Thereafter,
Representative Robert Farr stated:
"I just want to add to the legislative history
here that it isn't just the size [of one's
interest in property]. It's also, I think, the
cost of the sale.... I think the cost [of the
sale] has to [be] weigh[ed] ... as one of
the factors as well [as] the percentages.
We grappled with trying to put some definition
in the statute and decided, since ...
the court is a court of equity in these
cases, that we felt it was best to leave the
discretion to the court to determine when
it's most reasonable to do this...." Id., p.
2028.

<P20>Our review of the legislative
history of the 2004 amendment to &sect; 52-500(a)
leads us to conclude that the legislature
intended for a trial court to determine
whether an individual holds a "minimal
interest" in property on the basis of the
totality of the circumstances and not merely
on the basis of the owner's fee interest.
The legislative history reflects that a property
owner's fee interest is but one factor
for a court to consider in determining
whether the owner's interest in the property
is minimal. Stated differently, one's
fee interest as
<SPage 150>
reflected in the relevant
deed is not dispositive. Although there are
a few legislative comments to suggest that
a 50 percent ownership interest would not
<Page 414>
be "minimal," these legislative comments
only go so far in providing interpretive
guidance. That is, the comments were
made in the context of hypotheticals with
all other things being equal. In this connection,
we recognize that in many, if not
most, circumstances, a one-half ownership
interest likely would <EM>not</EM> result in a court's
determination that such interest is minimal
for purposes of &sect; 52-500 (a). Nevertheless,
it bears repeating that "`[t]he determination
of what equity requires is a matter for
the discretion of the trial court' to be
determined on a case-by-case basis.... <EM>DiCerto</EM>
v. <EM>Jones,</EM> supra, 108 Conn. App. [at]
188 n.3 [947 A.2d 409]." <EM>Cavanagh</EM> v. <EM>Richichi,</EM>
212 Conn. App. 402, 416, 275 A.3d
701 (2022).

<P20>In addition, the fact that the 2004
amendment was enacted in response to
<EM>Fernandes</EM> v. <EM>Rodriguez,</EM> supra, 255 Conn.
47, 761 A.2d 1283, in which each owner
held an undivided one-half fee interest in
the property; <EM>Fernandes</EM> v. <EM>Rodriguez,</EM> 90
Conn. App. 601, 609 n.5, 879 A.2d 897, cert.
denied, 275 Conn. 927, 883 A.2d 1243
(2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1027, 126 S.
Ct. 1585, 164 L. Ed. 2d 312 (2006); bolsters
our conclusion that a one-half fee interest
<EM>may</EM> be deemed, if the totality of the circumstances
warrants, a minimal interest
for purposes of the equitable contribution
option set forth in &sect; 52-500 (a). In sum,
guided by the legislative history, we reject
the plaintiff's assertion that his one-half
fee interest in the property precludes, as a
matter of law, a determination that his
interest in the property was minimal for
purposes of &sect; 52-500 (a).<fnr7>
<SPage 151>

<P20>We note that taking the plaintiff's
position to its logical conclusion would deprive
the court of the additional equitable
discretion that the legislature gave the
court when it enacted the 2004 amendment
to &sect; 52-500 (a), while providing no real
benefit to the plaintiff. That is, if a one-half
interest in real property could not, as a
matter of law, be considered a "minimal
interest" for purposes of &sect; 52-500 (a), a
trial court, in crafting a remedy, would be
limited, as it was prior to the 2004 amendment,
to ordering either a partition in kind
or a partition by sale. See <EM>Fernandes</EM> v.
<EM>Rodriguez,</EM> supra, 255 Conn. at 57, 761
A.2d 1283 (prior to 2004 amendment creating
third mode of relief, court reaffirmed
that partition by division and partition by
sale were only two modes of relief available
to trial court in partition action).
Forcing the parties to remain in an ownership
relationship would not be a legally
permissible option. See <EM>Geib</EM> v. <EM>McKinney,</EM>
224 Conn. 219, 224, 617 A.2d 1377 (1992)
("`No person can be compelled to remain
the owner with another of real estate, not
even if he becomes such by his own act;
every owner is entitled to the fullest enjoyment
of his property, and that can come
only through an ownership free from dictation
by others as to the manner in which it
may be exercised. Therefore the law afforded
to every owner with another relief
by way of partition....' <EM>Johnson</EM> v. <EM>Olmsted,</EM>
49 Conn. 509, 517 (1882)...." (Citations
omitted.)). Thus, in the plaintiff's
view, the court would have to choose between
a partition in kind, which likely is
impracticable in the context of a parcel
that includes a physical structure such as a
house, and a partition by sale. A partition
by sale likely would lead to the same result
for the party seeking partition (in this
case, the plaintiff) as he would achieve
<Page 415>
through the statute's third mode of relief,
i.e., equitable distribution (the option exercised
by the trial court). Here, had the
trial court ordered a partition by sale, the
court would have had
<SPage 152>
the discretion to
award the plaintiff the same amount he
complains of now as just compensation.
See, e.g., <EM>Fernandes</EM> v. <EM>Rodriguez,</EM> supra,
255 Conn. at 60, 761 A.2d 1283 (in context
of partition by sale, trial court may distribute
sale proceeds in accordance with equitable
interest of each party). Other than
vindicating some other motive, it is not
clear how a partition by sale would benefit
the plaintiff, as he still would be entitled to
only his equitable share of the sale proceeds.<fnr8>
By contrast, the defendant clearly
would be harmed because she would be
required to vacate her home and find a
new place for her and her family to live
using the proceeds from the sale. The legislative
history makes clear that &sect; 52-500
(a) was amended to give the court the
equitable discretion to avoid such an anomalous
result.

<P20>Finally, and relatedly, we note
that our conclusion is consistent with the
well settled principle, in the partition by
sale context, that, simply because a party
owns by title an undivided one-half interest
in property, "it does not follow that he
or she will necessarily be entitled to equal
shares of the moneys obtained from the
sale. Equities must be considered and, if
established, must be liquidated before distribution
is ordered." <EM>Levay</EM> v. <EM>Levay,</EM> 137
Conn. 92, 96, 75 A.2d 400 (1950); see <EM>Hackett</EM>
v. <EM>Hackett,</EM> 42 Conn. Supp. 36, 40, 598
A.2d 1112 (1990), aff'd, 26 Conn. App. 149,
598 A.2d 1103 (1991), cert. denied, 221
Conn. 905, 600 A.2d 1359 (1992); see also,
e.g., <EM>Cavanagh</EM> v. <EM>Richichi,</EM> supra, 212
Conn. App. at 413, 275 A.3d 701 ("[b]ecause
a partition action is an equitable
action, the court has the authority to determine
an unequal award on the basis of
the evidence presented, including the value
of the property and the equitable interests"
(internal quotation marks omitted)).

<P20>Having concluded that the
term "minimal interest," as set forth in
&sect; 52-500 (a), contemplates consideration
<SPage 153>
of both a property owner's fee interest
<EM>and</EM> any relevant equitable factors, we
turn to our review of the trial court's
determination that the plaintiff had a minimal
interest in the property. At the outset,
we observe that the court made several
significant factual findings to support that
determination, none of which the plaintiff
meaningfully contests on appeal. Specifically,
the court found that (1) in 2015, the
defendant purchased the property with no
financial assistance from the plaintiff, (2)
the defendant alone paid the mortgage,
taxes, and insurance on the property, (3)
the plaintiff, along with his son, moved in
with the defendant at some point after the
purchase of the property, (4) the plaintiff
paid the defendant $400 per month for
groceries and other household expenses,
and he contributed $2000 toward the maintenance
of the property, (5) in 2019, the
plaintiff vacated the property, taking with
him some furnishings purchased by the
defendant, (6) the plaintiff did not make a
purported $4000 payment to the defendant
upon moving out of the property, and (7)
the plaintiff has not made any financial
contributions toward the property after
moving out in 2019. In light of these findings,
and mindful that "we must make
every reasonable presumption in favor of
the correctness of its action"; (internal
quotation marks omitted) <EM>DiCerto</EM> v.
<EM>Jones,</EM> supra, 108 Conn. App. at 189, 947
A.2d 409; we conclude that the court did
not abuse its discretion in determining
that, notwithstanding his status as a joint
<Page 416>
tenant of the property, the plaintiff had a
minimal interest in the property for purposes
of &sect; 52-500 (a). See <EM>Zealand</EM> v. <EM>Balber,</EM>
205 Conn. App. 376, 385-86, 257 A.3d
411 (2021) (upholding trial court's determination
that plaintiff, tenant in common,
had minimal interest in property, which
was supported by findings that (1) defendant
was "`sole source of providing the
moneys'" to purchase property, to make
improvements to property, to purchase
furnishings, artwork, and other artifacts,
and to take on mortgage debt and other
expenses, (2) property was not
<SPage 154>
parties'
principal residence and was used in limited
capacity for approximately three and one-half
years, and (3) parties had not reached
agreement as to disposition of property if
they parted ways).

<P20>To support his position that the court
incorrectly determined that he had a minimal
interest in the property, the plaintiff
principally relies on <EM>Fusco</EM> v. <EM>Austin,</EM> 141
Conn. App. 825, 64 A.3d 794 (2013). His
reliance is misplaced. In <EM>Fusco,</EM> the trial
court determined that the plaintiff's joint
tenancy did not constitute a minimal interest
in the property, "particularly in view of
the fact that [the plaintiff] lived on the
property for twenty-three years and acquired
his interest at the same time the
defendant acquired her interest." Id., at
833-34, 64 A.3d 794. Moreover, the court
further "specifically found that during the
period of the parties' cohabitation, their
contributions to the property were relatively
equal"; id., at 834, 64 A.3d 794; and
that, at the time of the closing, the parties
had executed an agreement providing in
relevant part that, "if the property is sold,
the defendant will receive 55 percent of
the net proceeds and the plaintiff will receive
45 percent of the net proceeds, subject
to either party's claim for verified
costs for property improvements." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 827,
64 A.3d 794. In stark contrast to the trial
court's findings in <EM>Fusco,</EM> in the present
case, (1) the parties, who were in a romantic
relationship, lived together at the property
for approximately four years, (2) the
defendant purchased the property and
paid the mortgage, taxes, and insurance
for the property without financial assistance
from the plaintiff, who acquired his
interest in the property by way of a quitclaim
deed a couple of years after the
purchase, (3) the parties' contributions to
the property were far from equal, and (4)
there was no evidence of any agreement
setting forth the parties' respective rights
and responsibilities concerning the property.
Thus, <EM>Fusco</EM> does not advance the
plaintiff's position.
<SPage 155>

<P20>In sum, we conclude that the court
did not abuse its discretion in determining
that the plaintiff had a minimal interest in
the property for purposes of &sect; 52-500 (a).

<CN>II

<P20>The plaintiff next claims that the
trial court abused its discretion in awarding
him, pursuant to &sect; 52-500 (a), $2000 in
just compensation for his interest in the
property, which equates to 1.35 percent of
the $148,000 in equity in the property. The
plaintiff maintains that the court failed "to
consider the ownership percentages of the
parties ... and the amount of monthly
contribution [the plaintiff] provided while
living in the residence." We are not persuaded.

<P20>"In a partition action, a court
is required to balance the equities between
the parties.... [I]t is not always true that
each tenant in common or joint tenant is
entitled to equal shares in the real estate....
Because a partition action is an
equitable action, the court has the authority
to determine an unequal award on the
basis of the evidence presented, including
the value of the property and the equitable
<Page 417>
interests of the parties.... Additionally,
as our Supreme Court has explained in the
context of our government takings jurisprudence,
[t]he question of what is just
compensation is an equitable one rather
than a strictly legal or technical one." (Citations
omitted; internal quotation marks
omitted.) <EM>Cavanagh</EM> v. <EM>Richichi,</EM> supra, 212
Conn. App. at 413-14, 275 A.3d 701.

<P20>When determining just compensation,
a trial court does not merely consider
the parties' ownership percentages, but,
rather, "[the] court may take into consideration
contributions, including improvements,
that the parties have made to the
subject property in its determination of
just compensation. See, e.g., <EM>Zealand</EM> v.
<EM>Balber,</EM> [supra, 205 Conn. App. at 393-94,
257 A.3d 411] (`[i]n light of those contributions,
the court awarded the plaintiff
$25,000 as just compensation'); <EM>Young</EM> v.
<EM>Young,</EM> 137
<SPage 156>
Conn. App. 635, 651, 49 A.3d
308 (2012) (trial court properly considered
plaintiff's expenditures related to upkeep,
including mortgage payments, household
repairs and grounds maintenance and taxes,
against countervailing claims for use
and occupancy); <EM>Hackett</EM> v. <EM>Hackett,</EM> 26
Conn. App. 149, 150, 598 A.2d 1103 (1991)
(following partition sale, party may `be
compensated out of the proceeds from the
sale of the parties' jointly owned property
for his past payments for mortgage, insurance,
taxes, improvements and repairs'),
cert. denied, 221 Conn. 905, 600 A.2d 1359
(1992)." <EM>Cavanagh</EM> v. <EM>Richichi,</EM> supra, 212
Conn. App. at 416-17, 275 A.3d 701. In
<EM>Fernandes</EM> v. <EM>Rodriguez,</EM> supra, 90 Conn.
App. 601, 879 A.2d 897, for example, the
trial court found the monetary contributions
of each party toward the purchase of
the property at issue to be particularly
relevant to its determination of the equities
and, despite the plaintiff's status as a
joint tenant, awarded him a 5 percent equitable
interest in the property. Id., at 610-12,
879 A.2d 897.

<P20>Here, the court found that the plaintiff
did not contribute financially to the property's
purchase, mortgage, taxes, or insurance
and that he participated financially
only to the extent of (1) $2000 in maintenance
expenses and (2) $400 per month for
groceries and other household expenses
during most of the time that he lived with
the defendant (a period during which his
son also lived in the home). Moreover, the
court expressly did not credit the plaintiff's
claims of various contributions to the
maintenance of the property. In light of
these findings based on the evidence presented,
we conclude that the court did not
abuse its discretion in making its award of
just compensation.

<P20>Insofar as the plaintiff argues that his
one-half title ownership interest in the
property as a joint tenant entitles him to
50 percent of the equity, that argument
has been squarely rejected by our appellate
courts. See id., at 609, 879 A.2d 897
("One of the defendant's principal arguments
<SPage 157>
on appeal is that the court's initial
finding that each party possessed a
one-half interest in the property as joint
tenants required the court to award him
one half of the proceeds of the partition
sale. This contention finds no support in
the case law." (Footnote omitted.)); see
also <EM>Levay</EM> v. <EM>Levay,</EM> supra, 137 Conn. at
96, 75 A.2d 400 ("Although each party was
the owner of an undivided one-half interest
in the property, it does not follow that he
or she will necessarily be entitled to equal
shares of the moneys obtained from the
sale. Equities must be considered....");
<EM>Zealand</EM> v. <EM>Balber,</EM> supra, 205 Conn. App.
at 387, 257 A.3d 411 ("it is not always true
that each tenant in common ... is entitled
to equal shares in the property" (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, we previously
have affirmed monetary awards of
<Page 418>
single-digit equitable interests in the context
of one-half ownership interests. See,
e.g., <EM>Zealand</EM> v. <EM>Balber,</EM> supra, at 379-80,
393-94, 257 A.3d 411 (awarding plaintiff
just compensation constituting approximately
5.7 percent equitable interest, despite
plaintiff's status as tenant in common
with one-half ownership interest); <EM>Fernandes</EM>
v. <EM>Rodriguez,</EM> supra, 90 Conn. App.
at 609, 612, 879 A.2d 897 (awarding plaintiff
5 percent equitable interest following
sale of property, despite plaintiff being
joint tenant with one-half ownership interest).

<P20>In sum, we conclude that the court did
not abuse its discretion in its award of just
compensation to the plaintiff for his interest
in the property.

<P20>The judgment is affirmed and the case is
remanded for the purpose of setting a new
date by which (1) the plaintiff shall transfer
his interest in the property by quitclaim
deed to the defendant, and (2) simultaneously
therewith, the defendant shall
transfer to the plaintiff the sum of $2000
as just compensation.

<P20>In this opinion the other judges
concurred.
<FN>
<fnt*> In accordance with federal law; see 18 U.S.C.
&sect; 2265 (d) (3) (2018), as amended by the
Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization
Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-103, &sect; 106, 136
Stat. 49, 851; we decline to identify any person
protected or sought to be protected under
a protection order, a protective order, or a
restraining order that was issued or applied
for, or others through whom that person's
identity may be ascertained.

<fnt1> Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems,
Inc. (MERS), was cited in as an additional
defendant in March, 2022. In his operative
amended complaint dated March 2, 2022, the
plaintiff alleged that MERS may claim an
interest in the property at issue by virtue of a
mortgage on the property. Although MERS
had filed an appearance, counsel for MERS
did not appear at trial, and the plaintiff's and
F. D.'s respective counsel represented that the
parties had reached an agreement regarding
MERS' interest in the action. MERS is not
participating in this appeal. Accordingly, we
refer to F. D. as the defendant.

<fnt2> General Statutes &sect; 52-500 (a) provides:
"Any court of equitable jurisdiction may,
upon the complaint of any person interested,
order the sale of any property, real or personal,
owned by two or more persons, when, in
the opinion of the court, a sale will better
promote the interests of the owners. If the
court determines that one or more of the
persons owning such real or personal property
have only a minimal interest in such property
and a sale would not promote the interests
of the owners, the court may order such
equitable distribution of such property, with
payment of just compensation to the owners
of such minimal interest, as will better promote
the interests of the owners."

<fnt3> At trial, the plaintiff was asked, inter alia,
about (1) income reported in his tax filings,
(2) his ability to afford making his claimed
contributions toward improvements to the
property, (3) the circumstances surrounding
other women transferring property to him,
and (4) his ability to produce bank statements.
In response, the plaintiff invoked his
fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination
and refused to respond to the questions.
The court instructed the parties to address
in their posttrial briefs the question of
"whether or not the court has the discretion
to draw adverse inferences in a civil action,
different from a criminal action, when an
individual asserts their fifth amendment privilege."
In her posttrial brief, citing <EM>Baxter</EM> v.
<EM>Palmigiano,</EM> 425 U.S. 308, 318, 96 S. Ct.
1551, 47 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1976), among others,
the defendant argued that the fifth amendment
does not forbid the drawing of an adverse
inference in a civil action when a party
invokes the privilege when refusing to testify
in response to a probative question. The defendant
argued that the court should draw
such an inference. The plaintiff argued that,
although the privilege does not prohibit the
drawing of an adverse inference in a civil
action, "this does not negate the work that
[the plaintiff] put in on the property." In its
memorandum of decision, the court stated
that it was drawing "no adverse inference
regarding the assertion by the plaintiff of his
constitutional right. Absent any consideration
of such assertion, the plaintiff's testimony,
particularly as to key issues in dispute, was
simply not credible."

<fnt4> At trial, the defendant testified that she was
residing at the property with her sister and
her sister's family.

<fnt5> We note that the plaintiff does not challenge
the trial court's related determination that a
sale would not promote the interests of the
parties.

<fnt6> As stated previously, &sect; 52-500 was amended
in 2004 to add the final sentence of subsection
(a) to allow a trial court in a partition action
&mdash;upon finding that (1) one or more property
owners has only a "minimal interest" in
the property and (2) a sale would not promote
the interests of the owners&mdash;to order equitable
distribution of the property, with payment
of just compensation to the owner(s) of such
minimal interest. See P.A. 04-93.

<fnt7> We note that in <EM>Zealand</EM> v. <EM>Balber,</EM> 205
Conn. App. 376, 257 A.3d 411 (2021), this
court upheld the trial court's determination
that, notwithstanding that the plaintiff was a
tenant in common with a one-half fee interest
in the property at issue, the plaintiff's interest
was minimal pursuant to &sect; 52-500 (a); however,
this court did not engage in a statutory
analysis of the term "minimal interest" in
that decision. Id., at 385-88, 257 A.3d 411.

<P20>In this certified appeal, the petitioner,
Dashawn Revels, appeals from the judgment
of the habeas court denying his petition
for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal,
the petitioner claims that the habeas court
improperly concluded that his right to the
effective assistance of counsel was not violated
when his trial counsel (1) conducted
inadequate cross-examinations, (2) failed to
introduce into evidence the petitioner's cell
phone records, and (3) failed to consult or
present experts on false confessions and
crime scene reconstruction. We affirm the
judgment of the habeas court.

<P20>On the basis of the evidence presented
at the petitioner's criminal trial, the jury
reasonably could have found the following
facts, as set forth by the Supreme Court in
the petitioner's direct appeal. "On the
night of March 31, 2009, sometime shortly
before 11 p.m., the victim, Bryan Davila,
was walking on Crystal Avenue, near the
<SPage 463>
Thames River Apartments, a three
building complex in New London (apartment
complex). A group of approximately
eight to nine men [(the group)], including
the [petitioner], were walking closely behind
him. The victim crossed over from
Crystal Avenue to State Pier Road. Most
of the men in the group continued walking
toward a nearby footbridge to a nearby
housing project. Two men in the group,
however, one of whom was the [petitioner],
remained near the victim. The [petitioner]
then ran toward the victim, who was on
the sidewalk on State Pier Road in front of
a building housing an electrical supply
company. When the victim attempted to
run, the [petitioner] fired numerous shots
at the victim, who fell to the ground. The
[petitioner] then fled the scene on foot.

<P20>"Immediately after he was shot, the victim
called 911. He was unable to communicate
with the dispatcher, so she triangulated
his location to the closest cell phone
tower. She then notified the New London
Police Department of the call and the likely
location of the victim. When police reported
to the area, they found the victim
lying face up on the sidewalk, breathing,
but unable to communicate, with a nine
millimeter semiautomatic pistol near his
right hand and his cell phone on the
ground nearby, with the call to the 911
dispatcher still connected. After securing
the area, some officers remained to assist
emergency medical services as they provided
treatment to the victim, while others
were sent to canvass the neighborhood.
The victim was subsequently taken by ambulance
to the hospital, where he was pronounced
dead at 11:37 p.m. The autopsy
later revealed that the victim bled to death
from gunshot wounds, one in the abdomen,
another in the left buttock, and a grazing
wound near the left shoulder blade. Two
.22 caliber bullets were recovered from the
victim's body. Eight spent .22 caliber shell
casings were discovered at the scene. A
single, nine millimeter cartridge
<SPage 464>
case
was removed from the chamber of the nine
millimeter pistol.

<P20>"While canvassing the area of the apartment
complex, Officer Justin Clachrie was
approached by two women, Fidelia Carrillo
and her younger sister. Because Carrillo
spoke only Spanish, her younger sister
translated for her. Carrillo explained to
Clachrie that she had seen the shooting
<Page 422>
from her apartment windows on the fifth
floor of 40-46 Crystal Avenue, a building in
the apartment complex. Although the
building was located approximately 265
feet away from where the victim's body
was found, Carrillo had been able to see
that the shooter was a black male with
braided hair, wearing a green camouflage
jacket, a red baseball cap, dark pants and
dark tennis shoes. Shortly after Clachrie
broadcast the description of the suspected
shooter over the radio, he received news
that other officers had located a suspect
matching that description. He then asked
Carrillo if she and her sister would accompany
him to view the suspect, which Carrillo
agreed to do.

<P20>"Clachrie drove Carrillo and her sister
to Home Street in New London, where
officers had apprehended the [petitioner].
When Clachrie pulled up at approximately
11:40 p.m., the [petitioner] was standing in
the middle of the road, handcuffed and
surrounded by uniformed police officers.
Clachrie directed the spotlight on his
cruiser toward the suspect, at which point
Carrillo, with no prompting from Clachrie,
exclaimed in Spanish, `That's him!' The
[petitioner] was wearing a camouflage
jacket, a red cap, and dark pants.

<P20>"The police had apprehended and detained
a second suspect, Eric Caple, in the
same general vicinity as the [petitioner].
After she had identified the [petitioner],
they brought Caple forward to show him
to Carrillo. Although Carrillo identified
Caple as being present at
<SPage 465>
the murder
scene, she hesitated in making the identification
and did not evince the same level of
`excitement' that she had displayed when
identifying the [petitioner].

<P20>"The [petitioner] was taken to the New
London Police Department, where his
hands and clothes were tested for gunshot
residue,<fnr1> and he was interviewed twice by
Detective Richard Curcuro. During the
first interview, after he was advised of his
rights, the [petitioner] denied being in the
area of the shooting. When Curcuro interviewed
the [petitioner] for a second time,
however, the [petitioner] admitted to being
present at the crime scene after being
shown still photographs of him taken from
video surveillance footage from cameras at
one of the buildings in the apartment complex.
The [petitioner] admitted that outside
the apartment complex, his group had a
confrontation with a Hispanic man. The
Hispanic male then pulled out a gun and
fired shots at the [petitioner's] group. Finally,
the [petitioner] told Curcuro that he
had fired back at the victim, and then had
discarded the gun by throwing it down an
embankment near the footbridge as he ran
away.<fnr2>
<Page 423>
<SPage 466>

<P20>"In a substitute information, the [petitioner]
was charged with murder in violation
of [General Statutes] &sect; 53a-54a. Following
his conviction, the [petitioner's]
subsequent motions for a new trial and a
judgment of acquittal were denied." (Footnotes

Conn. 762, 766-69, 99 A.3d 1130 (2014),
cert. denied, 574 U.S. 1177, 135 S. Ct. 1451,
191 L. Ed. 2d 404 (2015). The Supreme
Court affirmed the judgment of conviction
on direct appeal. Id., at 785, 99 A.3d 1130.

<P20>On September 30, 2020, the petitioner
filed a second amended petition for a writ
of habeas corpus, claiming in relevant part
that his trial counsel, Attorneys Bruce
Sturman and Jennifer Baldwin, provided
ineffective assistance during his criminal
trial.<fnr3> The petitioner alleged that Sturman
had been ineffective because he "fail[ed] to
consult with and present the testimony of
experts on eyewitness identification, crime
scene reconstruction and coerced confessions,"
failed to "adequately cross-examine
two of the state's witnesses," and "failed to
introduce certain evidence," including the
petitioner's cell phone records.

<P20>The habeas court, <EM>Bhatt, J.,</EM> conducted
a trial on October 19, 2022, and January
11 and May 26, 2023. The petitioner presented
the testimony of several witnesses,
including Detective Richard Curcuro, Attorney
Brian Carlow, and experts Brian
Cutler and Peter Valentin. The petitioner
was unable to call Sturman as a witness
during the habeas trial, but did present
the testimony of Baldwin, who had acted
as second chair during the petitioner's
criminal trial.<fnr4> The petitioner provided
and the court admitted several exhibits,
including Carrillo's
<SPage 467>
statement to the
police, transcripts from the underlying
criminal proceeding, surveillance footage,
the petitioner's cell phone records, a dashcam
video, and a photo replicating what
Carrillo could have observed from her
apartment the night of the shooting.

<P20>On May 31, 2023, the court issued a
memorandum of decision denying the petition.
As to the petitioner's claim that counsel
was deficient in failing to consult with
and present certain expert testimony, the
habeas court determined that (1) Sturman
was not deficient in failing to hire a crime
scene reconstruction expert and that the
petitioner did not prove prejudice, (2)
Sturman's failure to obtain an expert on
coerced confessions did not prejudice the
petitioner, and (3) Sturman was not deficient
in failing to hire an eyewitness identification
expert and that the petitioner did
not prove prejudice. The habeas court also
rejected the petitioner's claims that counsel
did not adequately cross-examine Curcuro
and Carrillo because the petitioner
failed to prove that Sturman acted deficiently
or prejudiced the petitioner in the
cross-examination of both witnesses. Lastly,
the court rejected the petitioner's claim
regarding Sturman's failure to introduce
records of the petitioner's cell phone usage
the night of the shooting, concluding that
Sturman did not render deficient performance
and that the petitioner did not prove
prejudice. The petitioner thereafter filed a
petition for certification to appeal from the
habeas court's denial of his writ of habeas
corpus, which the habeas court granted.
This appeal followed. Additional facts will
be set forth as necessary.
<Page 424>

<P20>We begin by setting forth the
relevant standard of review and decisional
law that guide our analysis of the petitioner's
claims. "The standard of review and
law governing ineffective assistance of
counsel claims is well settled. The habeas
court is afforded broad discretion in making
its factual findings, and those findings
<SPage 468>
will not be disturbed unless they are
clearly erroneous.... Historical facts constitute
a recital of external events and the
credibility of their narrators.... Accordingly,
[t]he habeas judge, as the trier of
facts, is the sole arbiter of the credibility
of witnesses and the weight to be given to
their testimony.... The application of the
habeas court's factual findings to the pertinent
legal standard, however, presents a
mixed question of law and fact, which is
subject to plenary review....

<P20>"A criminal defendant is constitutionally
entitled to adequate and effective
assistance of counsel at all critical
stages of criminal proceedings. <EM>Strickland</EM>
v. <EM>Washington,</EM> [466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.
Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984)]. This
right arises under the sixth and fourteenth
amendments to the United States constitution
and article first, &sect; 8, of the Connecticut
constitution.... It is axiomatic that
the right to counsel is the right to effective
assistance of counsel.... A claim of ineffective
assistance of counsel consists of two
components: a performance prong and a
prejudice prong. To satisfy the performance
prong ... the petitioner must demonstrate
that his attorney's representation
was not reasonably competent or within
the range of competence displayed by lawyers
with ordinary training and skill in the
criminal law.... To satisfy the prejudice
prong, [the petitioner] must demonstrate
that there is a reasonable probability that,
but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the
result of the proceeding would have been
different.... The claim will succeed only if
both prongs are satisfied.... Consequently,
[i]t is well settled that [a] reviewing
court can find against a petitioner on either
ground, whichever is easier." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Raynor</EM> v.
<EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 222 Conn.
App. 584, 600-601, 306 A.3d 25 (2023), cert.
denied, 348 Conn. 944, 307 A.3d 910 (2024).
<SPage 469>

<P20>"In order for a petitioner to
prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance
on the basis of deficient performance, he
must show that, considering all of the circumstances,
counsel's representation fell
below an objective standard of reasonableness
as measured by prevailing professional
norms.... In any case presenting an
ineffectiveness claim, the performance inquiry
must be whether counsel's assistance
was reasonable considering all the circumstances.
Prevailing norms of practice as
reflected in American Bar Association
standards and the like, e.g., ABA Standards
for Criminal Justice ... are guides
to determining what is reasonable, but
they are only guides. No particular set of
detailed rules for counsel's conduct can
satisfactorily take account of the variety of
circumstances faced by defense counsel or
the range of legitimate decisions regarding
how best to represent a criminal defendant.
Any such set of rules would interfere
with the constitutionally protected independence
of counsel and restrict the wide
latitude counsel must have in making tactical
decisions....

<P20>"[J]udicial scrutiny of counsel's
performance must be highly deferential. It
is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess
counsel's assistance after conviction
or adverse sentence, and it is all too
easy for a court, examining counsel's defense
after it has proved unsuccessful, to
conclude that a particular act or omission
of counsel was unreasonable.... A fair
assessment of attorney performance requires
that every effort be made to eliminate
<Page 425>
the distorting effects of hindsight, to
reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's
challenged conduct, and to evaluate the
conduct from counsel's perspective at the
time. Because of the difficulties inherent in
making the evaluation, a court must indulge
a strong presumption that counsel's
conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable
professional assistance;
<SPage 470>
<EM>that is,
the</EM> [<EM>petitioner</EM>] <EM>must overcome the presumption
that, under the circumstances,
the challenged action might be considered
sound trial strategy.</EM>... Indeed, our Supreme
Court has recognized that [t]here
are countless ways to provide effective assistance
in any given case. Even the best
criminal defense attorneys would not defend
a particular client in the same
way.... [A] reviewing court is required
not simply to give [the trial attorney] the
benefit of the doubt ... but to affirmatively
entertain the range of possible reasons
... counsel may have had for proceeding
as [he] did...." (Emphasis in original;

v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 220
Conn. App. 285, 305-306, 298 A.3d 636,
cert. denied, 348 Conn. 915, 303 A.3d 603
(2023).

<P20>"Thus, a court deciding an actual ineffectiveness
claim must judge the reasonableness
of counsel's challenged conduct on the
facts of the particular case, viewed as of
the time of counsel's conduct.... At the
same time, the court should recognize that
counsel is strongly presumed to have rendered
adequate assistance and made all
significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable
professional judgment." (Internal

<CN>I

<P20>We begin with the petitioner's claim that
the habeas court improperly determined
that Sturman was not ineffective in his
cross-examination of two witnesses. Specifically,
the petitioner asserts that Sturman's
cross-examination of Carrillo, an
eyewitness, and Curcuro, a detective who
interviewed the petitioner, were deficient.
We disagree.

<P20>The following legal principles
pertaining to the deficient performance
component of the <EM>Strickland</EM> test
<SPage 471>
are
relevant to our resolution of these claims.
"As this court has explained, [o]nce an
attorney makes an informed, strategic decision
regarding how to cross-examine a
witness, that decision is virtually unchallengeable."

1073 (2023), cert. denied, 348 Conn. 953,
309 A.3d 303 (2024). "[A]n attorney's line
of questioning on examination of a witness
clearly is tactical in nature. [As such, this]
court will not, in hindsight, second-guess
counsel's trial strategy.... The fact that
counsel arguably could have inquired more
deeply into certain areas, or failed to inquire
at all into areas of claimed importance,
falls short of establishing deficient
performance." (Internal quotation marks

Correction,</EM> 215 Conn. App. 207, 228-29,

App. 787, 802, 198 A.3d 630 (2018) ("[a]lthough
the petitioner, with the benefit of
hindsight, may now prefer that trial counsel
had undermined [the witness'] testimony
... he fails to sufficiently demonstrate
how the line of questioning [trial counsel]
actually pursued was not part of a sound
trial strategy, or how it fell outside the
range of competence displayed by lawyers
with ordinary training and skill in the
<Page 426>
criminal law"), cert. denied, 330 Conn. 959,
199 A.3d 560 (2019).

<CN>A

<P20>First, the petitioner argues that
Sturman's cross-examination of Carrillo
was deficient because he failed to (1) highlight
discrepancies between Carrillo's
statement to the police and her testimony
at the criminal trial and (2) elicit testimony
that would demonstrate the fallibility and
unreliability of her eyewitness identification
of the petitioner. We disagree.

<P20>The following additional procedural history
is relevant to the petitioner's claim.
During a suppression
<SPage 472>
hearing, Carrillo
was asked to make an identification of the
shooter, and she identified the legal intern
for the public defender's office who was
sitting at counsel table. Subsequently, during
the petitioner's criminal trial, she made
an in-court identification of the petitioner
as the shooter. On cross-examination, however,
she acknowledged that she had misidentified
the shooter during the suppression
hearing. In addition, she conceded
that she only saw the shooter's clothes on
the night of the shooting. She agreed with
Sturman that she switched to different
windows as the incident unfolded, that the
distance between her apartment windows
and the spot on the pavement where the
victim fell was a long distance, and that it
was nighttime when she observed the
shooting. Sturman emphasized these
points during his closing argument. Sturman,
however, did not question Carillo
about discrepancies between her criminal
trial direct testimony and her statement to
the police.<fnr5>

<P20>At the petitioner's habeas trial, Baldwin
recounted that she and Sturman "talked
about Miss Carrillo a lot." Specific points
they wanted to elicit in Carrillo's cross-examination
included: her distance from
the incident, the lack of lighting at the
time of the incident, and the impact that
running between windows would have had
on her ability to observe. It was their plan
to further emphasize that Carrillo identified
the clothing worn by the shooter and
did not identify the shooter.

<P20>The petitioner's counsel presented an
eyewitness identification expert during the
habeas trial.<fnr6> The
<SPage 473>
habeas court found
that an expert would have testified that
there was an increased risk of misidentification
because: the identification was
cross-racial in nature; there existed several
opportunities for change blindness;<fnr7> and
the darkness and the distance of the apartment
from the incident would have affected
her memory of the shooter's characteristics.
The habeas court, in addressing the
two claims of deficiency in cross-examining
Carrillo about the inconsistent statements
and reliability of her identification, found
that the petitioner's assertions were "flatly
belied by the evidence presented at the
<Page 427>
criminal trial." The habeas court focused
on the fact that Sturman had extensively
cross-examined Carrillo about her ability
to view the incident from her apartment
windows and her misidentification of an
intern as the shooter during the suppression
hearing.

<P20>We agree with the habeas court that
Sturman's cross-examination of Carrillo
did not fall below an objective standard of
reasonableness considering all of the circumstances.
Sturman was faced with challenging
compelling testimony from the sole
eyewitness, and his cross-examination was
robust and made the jury aware of problems
with the identification. He called attention
to the fallibility of the eyewitness
identification during the cross-examination
by highlighting the cross-racial nature of
the identification, the distance between
Carrillo's apartment window and the
scene, the difficulty Carrillo experienced
when trying to pinpoint features of other
individuals on the scene, and the misidentification
that took place during the suppression
hearing. This court will not, in
hindsight, second-guess Sturman's trial
strategy; the petitioner's argument that
Sturman could
<SPage 474>
have inquired further
into certain areas during cross-examination
falls short of establishing deficient
performance.<fnr8> <EM>Crenshaw</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> supra, 215 Conn. App. at
228-29, 281 A.3d 546. Accordingly, the habeas
court properly determined that the
petitioner failed to establish deficient performance.

<CN>B

<P20>The petitioner next asserts that
Sturman rendered ineffective assistance by
inadequately cross-examining Curcuro.
The petitioner claims that Sturman's
cross-examination should have given the
jury a "reason to disbelieve the petitioner's
inculpatory statements" by introducing details
about Curcuro's interview of the petitioner.
Specifically, he emphasizes that
Sturman "did not question Curcuro on
whether tactics such as: repeatedly insisting
the petitioner was lying, insisting they
had proof he was lying, suggesting there
were probably extenuating circumstances
that excused shooting the victim, and assuring
him he would be better off if he
confessed and showed remorse, were tactics
that Curcuro had been trained to use
to wear a suspect down." We are not persuaded.

<P20>The habeas court judge found that
Sturman cross-examined Curcuro and elicited
the following. On the
<SPage 475>
night of the
incident, Curcuro first interviewed the petitioner
at 1 a.m. The petitioner denied involvement
with or knowledge of the shooting,
and the interview was terminated
around 2 a.m. Another interview was initiated
about three hours later, and the petitioner
confirmed that he was present at
the scene of the homicide after being
<Page 428>
shown still photographs of him taken from
video surveillance footage from one of the
apartment complex's cameras. The petitioner
continued denying that he was the
shooter. However, about thirty minutes
into the second interview, he confessed to
shooting the victim.

<P20>Curcuro also described the following
about the interview process. He repeatedly
told the petitioner he was there to help
him. Furthermore, Curcuro knew that a
confession from the petitioner would be
helpful to the police. The petitioner was
dressed solely in an undershirt, underwear,
and a hospital gown because the
police had taken his clothing.

<P20>In its memorandum of decision, the habeas
court concluded that "Sturman examined
the areas now complained of and [the
petitioner] cannot prove that had Attorney
Sturman better or further inquired into
these areas, there is a reasonable likelihood
that the outcome of the trial would
have been different."

<P20>We agree with the habeas court that
Sturman's performance did not fall below
an objective standard of reasonableness
and thus was not deficient. As found by
the habeas court, Sturman elicited testimony
about the circumstances surrounding
the petitioner's interview. Through Sturman's
cross-examination of Curcuro, the
jury was put on notice about the uncomfortable
circumstances under which the petitioner
was interviewed, the false insistence
that he was helping the petitioner,
and other facts that could reasonably demonstrate
that Curcuro's interview tactics
were coercive. We will not
<SPage 476>
second-guess
trial counsel's strategy; evidence of counsel's
failure to inquire into certain areas of
claimed importance in as much detail as
the petitioner claims in hindsight was necessary
falls short of establishing deficient
performance. See <EM>Crenshaw</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> supra, 215 Conn.
App. at 228-29, 281 A.3d 546; see also
<EM>Antonio A.</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
148 Conn. App. 825, 832, 87 A.3d 600 (noting
"`attorney's line of questioning on examination
of a witness clearly is tactical in
nature'"), cert. denied, 312 Conn. 901, 91
A.3d 907 (2014).

<P20>Accordingly, the petitioner's claim that
Sturman rendered ineffective assistance of
counsel by inadequately cross-examining
the two witnesses fails.

<CN>II

<P20>Next, the petitioner claims that
the habeas court improperly determined
that Sturman was not ineffective in his
failure to introduce cell phone records
from the night of the shooting. The petitioner
asserts that the habeas court's reliance
on Baldwin's testimony is misplaced.
The petitioner further argues that introducing
the cell phone records and establishing
that the petitioner was on his cell
phone during the shooting was a critical
element of the theory that he was not the
shooter because his right and dominant
hand was in a cast. We are not persuaded.

<P20>The following additional procedural history
is relevant to our resolution of this
claim. During the criminal trial, the petitioner
testified that he was on the phone
with his girlfriend at the time of the incident.
He stated that he was holding his
phone with his left hand.

<P20>By way of background, Fung Kwok, a
state forensic expert, was called by the
state to testify as to the gunshot residue
(GSR) testing he performed on the petitioner
and the victim. His report was admitted
as evidence at the criminal trial.
One of his analyses detected
<SPage 477>
lead from
residue on the petitioner's left palm, the
back of his right hand, and the right cuff
of his sweatshirt. He testified that presence
of a GSR element, such as lead, can
<Page 429>
indicate that someone fired a gun, because
the particles are typically expelled from
the gun onto the shooter's hand or clothing.
However, with time, the GSR particles
can fall from or be brushed off of the hand
or clothing. On the basis of the GSR results
here, Kwok could not confirm if the
petitioner, or the victim, had fired a gun.

<P20>At the habeas trial, Baldwin provided
relevant testimony as to the petitioner's
claim that the cell phone records should
have been introduced at trial. She and
Sturman had reviewed the cell phone records
to confirm whether the petitioner was
on the phone at the time of the shooting.
To her recollection, however, Sturman's
primary focus was third-party culpability.
She believed that drawing attention to the
petitioner's hands "might not have been
the best defense" because the state's theory,
in reliance on the GSR evidence, was
that the petitioner used his right hand to
shoot the victim.

<P20>In its memorandum of decision, the habeas
court stated that the cell phone records,
and thus the fact that the petitioner
was on the phone at the time of the incident,
do not preclude the possibility that
the petitioner shot the victim. As a result,
the habeas court "[could not] conclude that
counsel performed deficiently by failing to
introduce the [cell] phone records or that
there is a reasonable likelihood of a different
outcome."

<P20>The following legal standards on the deficient
performance prong are relevant to
our resolution of this claim. "A fair assessment
of attorney performance requires
that every effort be made to eliminate the
distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct
the circumstances of counsel's challenged
conduct, and to evaluate the

220 Conn. App. at 305-306, 298 A.3d 636.
This assessment applies when defense
counsel decides not to raise certain issues
or evidence during trial. See <EM>Ramey</EM> v.
<EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 150 Conn.
App. 205, 214, 90 A.3d 344 (finding defense
counsel's decision not to raise issue of petitioner's
level of intoxication to jury, in
order to avoid calling attention to petitioner's
intoxication, "`falls into the category
of trial strategy or judgment calls that we
consistently have declined to second
guess'"), cert. denied, 314 Conn. 902, 99
A.3d 1168 (2014); <EM>Peruccio</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner

denied, 287 Conn. 920, 951 A.2d 569 (2008).

<P20>We conclude that Sturman did not render
deficient performance in deciding not
to introduce the cell phone records because
that decision reflected sound trial
strategy. Baldwin explained to the best of
her recollection that, in choosing not to
focus on the phone call between the petitioner
and his girlfriend, Sturman avoided
calling attention to the petitioner's hands
and thus avoided the state's further probing
of the concerning GSR evidence. "Simply
put, trial counsel made a reasonable
strategic decision that the risk associated
with presenting [certain] evidence ... was
not justified." <EM>Clinton S.</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 174 Conn. App. 821, 832, 167

<SPage 479>
courts consistently refuse
to second-guess"), cert. denied, 290 Conn.
<Page 430>
901, 962 A.2d 128 (2008). Accordingly, the
habeas court did not improperly determine
that the petitioner failed to establish that
Sturman's decision not to introduce the
cell phone records was unreasonable.

<CN>III

<P20>We finally turn to the petitioner's claim
that the habeas court improperly determined
that Sturman was not ineffective in
failing to consult or present experts during
the criminal trial. Specifically, the petitioner
claims that the assistance of experts on
false confessions and crime scene reconstruction
was necessary to his defense. We
address each claim in turn.

<CN>A

<P20>First, the petitioner argues that
the habeas court improperly concluded
that he had failed to establish that he was
prejudiced as a result of Sturman's allegedly
deficient performance in failing to
consult or present the testimony of an
expert on false confessions.<fnr9> We are not
persuaded.

<P20>The following additional facts and procedural
history are relevant to our discussion.
At the criminal trial, Curcuro testified
that his first task upon assignment to
the investigation was to interview the petitioner,
in an interview room, the night of
the shooting. During the first interview,
Curcuro asked the petitioner multiple
times whether he was in the area of the
shooting. The petitioner denied being
there and, after one hour of questioning,
terminated the interview at around 2 a.m.
<SPage 480>

<P20>Curcuro then swabbed the petitioner
for GSR and DNA testing. Curcuro also
was able to obtain screenshots of the
apartment building's surveillance footage,
which showed the petitioner to be present
at the time of the incident. Curcuro then
initiated a second interview with the petitioner
around 5 a.m. and showed the petitioner
still photographs of him taken from
video surveillance footage. About ten minutes
into the second interview, the petitioner
admitted to his presence in the
group at the time of the shooting. He
continued to deny any involvement in the
shooting. However, several minutes later,
he explained to Curcuro that "I was just
... going through the projects, and some
guy said something to one of my peoples. I
don't know. So we paid him no mind,
crossed the bridge, went to [Crystal]. Next
thing you know, we're coming back, and
he's just walking around. He's right there
now. He pulls out a gun and starts shooting.
We start shooting back. And then he
just ... then he just dropped. He opened
fire first."<fnr10>

<P20>As summarized by the habeas court,
Curcuro acknowledged the following when
cross-examined by Sturman. "[I]t would
have been helpful to [the police if the
petitioner] had confessed to the murder
and, [that] during the course of the interrogation,
[he] was suggesting a defense of
extenuating circumstances to [the petitioner]....
[He] repeatedly told [the petitioner]
that he was there to help [the petitioner]."
During the interviews, the petitioner
was wearing an undershirt, underwear,
and a hospital gown because the police had
taken the petitioner's clothing as evidence.

<P20>The petitioner testified at length during
the criminal trial. He testified that he did
<Page 431>
not shoot the victim. He also described the
interview conducted by Curcuro. The petitioner
stated that he initially lied about
being
<SPage 481>
present during the shooting because
he was scared, and he later refused
to provide the names of the shooters because
he was afraid of retaliation. He explained
that he gave a false confession
because he believed Curcuro would only
settle for a confession from him and did
not want to hear that someone else shot
the victim. During the criminal trial closing
arguments, Sturman addressed the petitioner's
confession. "Sturman repeatedly
noted [the petitioner's] numerous denials
and provided reasons why he may have
ultimately confessed. He argued that due
to the weakness of the eyewitness identification,
the police needed a confession and
so went aggressively after [the petitioner]
in their interrogations."

<P20>At the habeas trial, Curcuro testified
about his interviews of the petitioner.
Baldwin also testified about her conversations
with Sturman and decisions that
were made to minimize damage caused by
the petitioner's confession. The habeas
court found that "Baldwin and Sturman
questioned why [the petitioner] gave a
statement and explored how that impacted
their position that the perpetrator was
someone else.... [Baldwin was] unaware
if Attorney Sturman conducted any research
on false confessions. They did not
consider consulting with an expert, and
[she] could not provide a reason why."

<P20>During the habeas trial, Brian Cutler
testified as an expert on coerced compliance
and forced confessions. When retained
to consult on false confessions, "he
typically evaluates the record including
any recording of an interrogation, information
about the suspect that indicates personal
risk factors for false confessions and
informs counsel about the relevant research
and finally offer[s] opinions about
the interrogation tactics used and analyzes
the record for evidence of contamination of
the confession."
<SPage 482>

<P20>Cutler provided his analysis of the
petitioner's interview. He "noted that [the
petitioner] was a young adult at the time
of the interrogation, which occurred late at
night or in the early morning. [The petitioner]
mentioned that he was fatigued at
various times; that he was cold and uncomfortable.
[Cutler] also noted certain features
present in [the petitioner's] interrogation
that would fall under the categories
of tactics that could lead to a false confession
such as theme development or building
toward an explanation of justification,
offering to help the suspect, direct positive
confrontation or false evidence ploys, suggesting
that the interrogator knows that
happened, expectation of reciprocity of
honesty, and the notion that time is limited
to come clean. He characterized it as a
powerful interrogation in the number and
type of tactics used. Some tactics were
problematic in that the investigators repeatedly
said they were there to help and
that confessing was in his best interest.
This is the type of interrogation that could
convince an innocent person that confessing
was the best option for damage control.
He did not see any evidence of mental
illness or disability but opined that [the
petitioner] was young at the time and that
combined with any fatigue or discomfort
would affect his ability to self-regulate."
However, Cutler acknowledged that he
had no way of knowing whether a particular
confession was true.

<P20>In its memorandum of decision, the habeas
court stated the following: "Assuming
that Attorney Sturman did not consult
such an expert and a false confession expert
would have been permitted to testify,
[the petitioner] must still prove that the
failure to do so prejudiced him. This he
has not done." The court determined that
<Page 432>
the evidence presented did not "demonstrate
that [the petitioner's] confession
was, in fact, false and would either have
been suppressed or the expert's testimony
so compelling when applied to the facts of
this
<SPage 483>
case that the jury would have completely
disregarded his statement that
he&mdash;or we&mdash;shot the victim." Furthermore,
the court recognized the influence that
Carrillo's testimony had on the jury, as she
identified the petitioner as the shooter.

<P20>On appeal, the petitioner asserts that
this is a "textbook example" of a coerced
confession where the only reasonable and
available defense strategy involves a consultation
with and/or presentation of an
expert. The petitioner argues that consulting
an expert would have (1) made Sturman
aware of the issues he needed to
focus on relating to false confessions and
(2) given the jury a basis to believe that
the petitioner, as a result of Curcuro's interviewing
methods, could have falsely
confessed. The petitioner contends that
Sturman did little to elicit testimony from
Curcuro or to present other evidence that
would have persuaded a jury that the petitioner
made a false confession.

<P20>The following legal principles are applicable.
"An evaluation of the prejudice
prong involves a consideration of whether
there is a reasonable probability that, absent
the errors, the [fact finder] would
have had a reasonable doubt respecting
guilt.... A reasonable probability is a
probability sufficient to undermine confidence
in the outcome.... We do not conduct
this inquiry in a vacuum, rather, we
must consider the totality of the evidence
before the judge or jury.... Further, we
are required to undertake an objective review
of the nature and strength of the
state's case.... As our Supreme Court
[has explained], [s]ome errors will have
had pervasive effect on the inferences to
be drawn from the evidence, altering the
entire evidentiary picture, and some will
have had an isolated, trivial effect. Moreover,
a verdict or conclusion only weakly
supported by the record is more likely to
have been affected by errors than one with
overwhelming record support.... [A]
court making the prejudice inquiry must
ask
<SPage 484>
if the [petitioner] has met the burden
of showing that the decision reached
would reasonably likely have been different
absent the errors....

<P20>"In other words, [i]n assessing prejudice
under <EM>Strickland,</EM> the question is not
whether a court can be certain counsel's
performance had no effect on the outcome
or whether it is possible a reasonable
doubt might have been established if counsel
acted differently.... Instead, <EM>Strickland</EM>
asks whether it is reasonably likely
the result would have been different....
The likelihood of a different result must be
substantial, not just conceivable.... Notably,
the petitioner must meet this burden
not by use of speculation but by demonstrable
realities." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Hilton</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 225 Conn. App. 309, 327-28,
315 A.3d 1135 (2024).

<P20>We agree with the habeas court and
conclude that Sturman's performance did
not prejudice the petitioner. At best, an
expert could have provided insight to Sturman
and/or the jury regarding false confessions.
Yet, Sturman's cross-examination
of Curcuro and his closing argument to the
jury reflected that he was aware of the
issues with the confession and conveyed
them to the jury. Furthermore, expert testimony
would not change the fact that the
jury had for its consideration other evidence,
including Carrillo's on scene identification
and the GSR evidence. As a result,
the petitioner has failed to demonstrate
that there exists a reasonable probability
that, but for Sturman's failure to consult
or present an expert on coerced and false
<Page 433>
confessions, the outcome of the proceeding
would have been different. See <EM>Jones</EM> v.
<EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 212 Conn.
App. 117, 128-36, 274 A.3d 237, cert. denied,
343 Conn. 933, 276 A.3d 975 (2022).

<CN>B

<P20>Second, the petitioner argues that
Sturman was deficient for failing to present
an expert on crime scene reconstruction.
We disagree.
<SPage 485>

<P20>The following additional procedural
history is relevant to the resolution of this
claim. In preparation for the criminal trial,
Sturman hired an investigator to take photographs
but ultimately determined that
those images would not be helpful to the
jury. He also submitted a motion to have
the jury view the scene of the crime, allowing
the jury to see the distance from which
Carrillo witnessed the shooting, but that
motion was denied.

<P20>During the criminal trial, a state trooper
testified that the scene of the shooting was
265.49 feet from Carrillo's window. The
jury also saw photographs and videos of
the crime scene. Sturman, through the
cross-examination of another state trooper,
elicited that an extensive number of lights
were deployed to illuminate the crime
scene while the photographs and videos
were captured. During closing argument,
Sturman focused on the unreliability of
Carrillo's testimony, pointing out that the
identification emphatically was made at
night from the fifth floor of the apartment
building at about 265 feet from the scene.

<P20>During the habeas trial, the petitioner's
counsel questioned Baldwin. Although
Baldwin was not aware of whether Sturman
consulted with a crime scene expert,
she testified that both she and Sturman
discussed Carrillo's inability to see the incident
due to distance and darkness. In
addition, a crime scene reconstruction expert,
Peter Valentin, testified on behalf of
the petitioner. Valentin took "photographs
from Carrillo's apartment to replicate what
she would have been able to observe ...
he used the options on the camera to make
the photographs mimic what could be seen
with the naked eye. The photograph that
best matched the naked eye view was admitted
as an exhibit."

<P20>In its memorandum of decision, the habeas
court found that Sturman was not
deficient for failing to hire
<SPage 486>
a crime scene
reconstruction expert. "The evidence establishes
that he attempted to take photographs;
the jury was presented with several
photographs of the scene; the distance
from the apartment to the scene was
known to the jury and he made a motion
for jury view which was denied. Clearly,
the ability of Carrillo to see the incident
from her apartment was challenged by the
defense."

<P20>On appeal, the petitioner contends that a
proper recreation provided by an expert,
such as the one created by Valentin, would
have provided the jury with an accurate
view of how far Carillo was from the scene
and how the low lighting would have made
it difficult to see people and their clothing.
In turn, the petitioner asserts that "[a]ny
reasonably competent attorney would have
hired an expert to capture that vantage
point rather than rely on his own investigator,
not equipped as an expert, to recreate
the scene."

<P20>The following legal principles
are relevant to our resolution of this claim.
"[T]here is no per se rule that requires a
trial attorney to seek out an expert witness.
However, this court noted that in
some cases, the failure to use any expert
can result in a determination that a criminal
defendant was denied the effective assistance
of counsel." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Kellman</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 178 Conn. App. 63, 77, 174
<Page 434>
A.3d 206 (2017). "[F]ailing to retain or
utilize an expert witness is not deficient
when part of a legitimate and reasonable
defense strategy.... Our appellate courts
repeatedly have rejected a petitioner's
claim that his trial counsel rendered deficient
performance by failing to call an
expert witness at trial on the ground that
trial counsel's decision was supported by a
legitimate strategic reason." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Vega</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 224 Conn. App. 652,
665, 312 A.3d 1142, cert. granted, 349
Conn. 914, 315 A.3d 300 (2024).
<SPage 487>

<P20>We agree with the habeas court that
Sturman did not render deficient performance
by failing to consult with or hire a
crime scene reconstruction expert. At the
habeas trial, the crime scene reconstructionist
presented a photograph mimicking
the conditions under which Carrillo was
seeing the shooting&mdash;and this would have
been his primary, if not sole, contribution
to the criminal trial. Although the accuracy
of the crime scene reconstructionist's photograph
surpassed that of the photographs
presented to the jury during the criminal
trial, the jury had ample evidence at its
disposal to evaluate Carrillo's ability to see
the incident from her apartment. Thus, the
petitioner has not shown that Sturman
performed deficiently, by not consulting
with or hiring a crime scene reconstruction
expert. Accordingly, the petitioner's claim
cannot prevail under <EM>Strickland.</EM>

<P20>The judgment is affirmed.

<P20>In this opinion the other judges
concurred.
<FN>
<fnt1> "The results of the gunshot residue tests
were inconclusive. They revealed the presence
of lead and antimony particles on the victim's
palms and the presence of lead on the [petitioner's]
left palm and the back of his right
hand. A single lead particle was discovered on
the right cuff of the [petitioner's] sweatshirt,
and no lead particles were discovered on his
jacket. On the basis of these results, the state's
forensic expert testified that he could not conclude
whether either the [petitioner] or the
victim had fired a gun on the night of the
shooting." <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Revels,</EM> 313 Conn. 762, 768
n.3, 99 A.3d 1130 (2014), cert. denied, 574
U.S. 1177, 135 S. Ct. 1451, 191 L. Ed. 2d 404
(2015).

<fnt2> "The interviews that Curcuro conducted of
the [petitioner] were recorded, and the transcript
of the recording indicates that rather
than stating, as Curcuro testified, `I shot
back,' the [petitioner] stated that after the
victim fired on the [petitioner's] group, `<EM>we</EM>
start shooting back.' (Emphasis added.) The
state claimed at trial that the recording from
which the transcript was taken was garbled,
and that the transcriber incorrectly heard the
[petitioner] to say `we' shot back, instead of `I'
shot back. The audio recording of the interviews
was played to the jury during trial."
<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Revels,</EM> 313 Conn. 762, 768 n.4, 99
A.3d 1130 (2014), cert. denied, 574 U.S. 1177,
135 S. Ct. 1451, 191 L. Ed. 2d 404 (2015).

<fnt3> Although the petitioner alleged claims of
ineffective assistance of counsel with respect
to both Sturman and Baldwin, the petitioner
did not appeal the court's rejection of his
claims with respect to Baldwin.

<fnt4> Baldwin represented the petitioner at the
arraignment. The case was then transferred to
part A of the Superior Court in New London.
She was not involved in the case again until
jury selection.

<fnt5> Inconsistencies between her statement to
the police and her testimony at trial included
whether she saw the following: a gun during
the shooting, a man biking circles around the
shooter, and the shooter pull something from
his waistband with both hands. She also gave
inconsistent statements regarding the order in
which she looked out her windows in her
apartment. Her statement to the police was
not introduced as an exhibit at the criminal
trial.

<fnt6> According to Baldwin, Sturman looked into
the possibility of obtaining an expert on eyewitness
identification. However, Baldwin did
not know the full reasons why an expert was
not hired.

<fnt7> The expert testified that "[c]hange blindness
refers to a phenomenon where we miss subtle
and sometimes large changes in the environment
because of, basically, inattention, and it
has been demonstrated to affect person recognition
when there is a disruption in the continuity
of the view."

<fnt8> The habeas corpus petitioner faces a "significant
hurdle" in "seeking to prove a claim of
ineffective assistance of trial counsel [if] trial
counsel ... is unavailable to provide evidence
of counsel's strategic decisions regarding, inter
alia, the pursuit of defenses for her client
and calling witnesses in support of those defenses."
<EM>Jordan</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
supra, 197 Conn. App. at 823, 234 A.3d 78.
"[I]t is not necessary for a reviewing court to
resolve what strategic decisions defense counsel
<EM>actually</EM> made, but it is required to presume
that the challenged actions were within
the wide range of reasonable professional
conduct if, under the circumstances, it <EM>might
have been</EM> sound trial strategy." (Emphasis in
original; internal quotation marks omitted.)
Id., at 862, 234 A.3d 78. The petitioner "has
the burden to overcome that presumption of
reasonable professional conduct" and trial
counsel's unavailability "[does] not relieve the
petitioner of the substantial burden of demonstrating
that [trial counsel's] representation
was less than constitutionally competent."
Id.; see id., at 862, 234 A.3d 78 (death of trial
counsel did not relieve petitioner's burden).

<fnt9> Because we conclude that the habeas court
properly determined that the petitioner failed
to establish prejudice, we need not address
<EM>Strickland</EM>'s performance prong. See <EM>Davis</EM> v.
<EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 198 Conn. App.
345, 367-68, 233 A.3d 1106, cert. denied, 335
Conn. 948, 238 A.3d 18 (2020).

<P20>The defendant, Barry Pringle, appeals
from the judgment of the trial court
denying his motion to correct an illegal
sentence filed pursuant to Practice Book
&sect; 43-22. On appeal, he makes several arguments
supporting his claim that the court
improperly denied his motion to correct an
illegal sentence. We dismiss the appeal as
moot.

<P20>On February 5, 2016, the defendant
pleaded guilty in four separate dockets,
which were consolidated, to assault in
the first degree in violation of General
Statutes &sect; 53a-59 (a) (1), promoting prostitution
in the second degree in violation of
General Statutes &sect; 53a-87, possession of
<Page 436>
narcotics with intent to sell in violation of
General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) &sect; 21a-277
(a), and sale of narcotics in violation of
General Statutes (Rev. to 2013) &sect; 21a-278
(b). Additionally, he pleaded guilty under
the <EM>Alford</EM> doctrine<fnr1> to tampering with a
witness
<SPage 362>
in violation of General Statutes
&sect; 53a-151. On the same day, the court,
<EM>Fasano, J.,</EM> canvassed the defendant and
sentenced him pursuant to a plea agreement
to a total effective sentence of ten
years of incarceration followed by ten
years of special parole. On January 21,
2021, the defendant filed the operative motion
to correct an illegal sentence in which
he raised various claims. On April 8, 2021,
the court denied the motion. This appeal
followed.<fnr2>

<P20>Thereafter, at a hearing on April 6,
2023, a prosecutor informed the court,
<EM>Schwartz, J.,</EM> that an agreement had been
made between the state and the defendant
to modify the defendant's sentence to eliminate
the ten year period of special parole.
The court then found that good cause existed
to modify the defendant's sentence to
ten years of incarceration and to eliminate
from his sentence the ten years of special
parole.<fnr3> On April 5, 2024, the defendant
was discharged fully from the sentence
imposed on February 5, 2016.
<SPage 363>

<P20>After oral argument before this court,
we ordered the parties, sua sponte, to file
additional supplemental memoranda addressing:
"(1) Whether the defendant is
serving any portion of the sentence imposed
on February 5, 2016; and (2) [i]f not,
whether the defendant's appeal from the
trial court's denial of his motion to correct
an illegal sentence must be dismissed as
moot because this court cannot afford him
practical relief. See <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Neary,</EM> 177
Conn. App. 871 [173 A.3d 982] (2017), cert.
denied, 328 Conn. 901 [177 A.3d 564]
(2018)."

<P20>"[B]ecause mootness implicates
this court's subject matter jurisdiction, it
may be raised at any time, including by
this court sua sponte, and is a threshold
matter that must be resolved first....
This is so because [i]t is a [well settled]
general rule that the existence of an actual
controversy is an essential requisite to appellate
jurisdiction; it is not the province of
<Page 437>
appellate courts to decide moot questions,
disconnected from the granting of actual
relief or from the determination of which
no practical relief can follow.... Because
mootness implicates subject matter jurisdiction,
it presents a question of law over

period of special parole and, on April 5,
2024, he was discharged fully from his
sentence. Because the defendant successfully
completed his sentence, there is no
practical relief that we can afford the defendant
as to the sentence imposed on
February 5, 2016. See <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Neary,</EM> supra,
177 Conn. App. at 873-74, 173 A.3d

criminal defendant is not required to admit
his guilt, but consents to being punished as if
he were guilty to avoid the risk of proceeding
to trial.... A guilty plea under the <EM>Alford</EM>
doctrine is a judicial oxymoron in that the
defendant does not admit guilt but acknowledges
that the state's evidence against him is
so strong that he is prepared to accept the
entry of a guilty plea nevertheless." (Emphasis

<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Faraday,</EM> 268 Conn. 174, 204-205,
842 A.2d 567 (2004).

<fnt2> The defendant is self-represented on appeal,
and we note that, although it is the established
policy of the Connecticut courts to be
solicitous of self-represented litigants and to
allow self-represented litigants some latitude,
we cannot overlook the rules of substantive
law. See, e.g., <EM>Traylor</EM> v. <EM>State,</EM> 332 Conn. 789,
806, 213 A.3d 467 (2019).

<fnt3> The state filed a motion to suspend the rules
to permit the late filing of the April 6, 2023
transcript, which this court granted. The April
6, 2023 transcript reveals that the sentence
modification only pertained to the defendant's
sentence for his conviction of assault in the
first degree, for which the defendant was sentenced
on February 5, 2016, to ten years of
incarceration followed by ten years of special
parole. The sentencing court also sentenced
him to five years of incarceration for promoting
prostitution, five years of incarceration for
possession of narcotics with intent to sell, five
years of incarceration for tampering with a
witness, and five years of incarceration for
the sale of narcotics, all of which were to run
concurrently for a total effective sentence of
ten years of incarceration followed by ten
years of special parole.

<fnt4> The defendant did not file a supplemental
memorandum concerning mootness. He,
however, stated at oral argument before this
court that he was not incarcerated and that
he was not on special parole because the
special parole portion of his sentence had
been eliminated. The state stated in its supplemental
memorandum that the defendant's
sentence was modified to eliminate the period
of special parole and that he has been discharged
fully from his remaining sentence.

<fnt5> To the extent that the defendant challenges
not only the legality of the sentence, but also
his underlying convictions, such a claim is
beyond the purview of a motion to correct an
illegal sentence. See <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Neary,</EM> supra, 177
Conn. App. at 874 n.2, 173 A.3d 982.

<P20>The petitioner, Khalid Ibrahim,
appeals from the judgment of the
habeas court dismissing his petition for a
writ of habeas corpus as untimely under
General Statutes &sect; 52-470(d) and (e).<fnr1> On
<Page 439>
appeal, the petitioner claims that the court
erred in concluding that he failed to establish
good cause for his late filed petition.
In particular, the petitioner argues that
evidence of his prior habeas counsel's failure
to advise him of the statutory deadline
for filing a new habeas petition following
the withdrawal of his then pending petition
alleging a double jeopardy violation would
<SPage 660>
establish ineffective assistance of counsel,
which constitutes good cause for the
delay in filing. In light of our Supreme
Court's recent decision in <EM>Rose</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 348 Conn. 333, 304
A.3d 431 (2023), and this court's subsequent
decisions in <EM>Coney</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 225 Conn. App. 450, 315
A.3d 1161 (2024), <EM>Michael G.</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner

of Correction,</EM> 223 Conn. App.
562, 308 A.3d 1113 (2024), we conclude that
the judgment of the habeas court must be
reversed and the case remanded for a new
good cause hearing.<fnr2>
<Page 440>
<SPage 661>

<P20>The following procedural history is
relevant to our resolution of the petitioner's
appeal. Following a jury trial, the
petitioner was convicted of felony murder
in violation of General Statutes &sect; 53a-54c
and kidnapping in the first degree in violation
of General Statutes &sect; 53a-92(a)(2)(A).
See <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Ibrahim,</EM> 62 Conn. App.
634, 634, 772 A.2d 680, cert. denied, 256
Conn. 919, 774 A.2d 139 (2001). The petitioner
received a total effective sentence of
fifty years of incarceration. This court affirmed
the judgment of conviction; see id.;
and our Supreme Court denied the subsequent
petition for certification. See <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>Ibrahim,</EM> 256 Conn. 919, 774 A.2d 139
(2001).

<P20>Thereafter, the petitioner filed his first
habeas petition, in which he alleged ineffective
assistance of trial counsel in his
criminal trial. The habeas court denied the
petition, and this court, in a per curiam
decision, affirmed the judgment of the habeas
court. See <EM>Ibrahim</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 132 Conn. App. 902, 30 A.3d
760, cert. denied, 303 Conn. 914, 32 A.3d
964 (2011). The petitioner filed his second
habeas petition on January 16, 2014. In
that action, he asserted a claim of a double
jeopardy violation; additionally, he sought
the restoration of his right to sentence
review. By way of a stipulated judgment
on August 24, 2016, the petitioner's right
to sentence review was restored, and he
agreed to withdraw his double jeopardy
claim.

<P20>On or about September 6, 2022, the petitioner
filed the underlying habeas petition
that is the subject of this appeal. In this
petition, he claims that his sentence was
illegal because his right to be free from
double jeopardy was violated when the
state charged him with both murder and
felony murder and that his criminal trial
counsel was ineffective in failing to inform
him of his "right to a plea bargain...."
At the request of the respondent, the
Commissioner of Correction, the court,
<EM>Newson, J.,</EM> ordered the petitioner to show
cause as to why this petition should not be
dismissed as untimely
<SPage 662>
because it was
filed beyond the time limit for successive
petitions in &sect; 52-470(d). See General Statutes
&sect; 52-470(e). At the show cause hearing,
the petitioner's counsel represented to
the habeas court, <EM>Bhatt, J.,</EM> that the petitioner
had wanted to pursue matters that
had been withdrawn in the prior habeas
action, namely, his double jeopardy claim.
The petitioner's counsel further stated that
he had spoken with prior habeas counsel,
who had acknowledged his failure to advise
the petitioner of the time limitation set
forth in &sect; 52-470. According to the petitioner's
counsel, prior habeas counsel also had
indicated that nothing in his file indicated
that he had alerted the petitioner to these
time constraints. The petitioner testified
that he was unaware of the two year limitation
of &sect; 52-470.

<P20>On December 22, 2022, the habeas court
issued a memorandum of decision summarizing
the petitioner's argument as being
that prior habeas counsel's failure to inform
him of the time limitations in &sect; 52-470
constituted ineffective assistance and
that, as a result of this alleged constitutional
violation, he had demonstrated good
cause for the untimely habeas filing. The
habeas court noted that this argument had
been considered and rejected by this court
<Page 441>
in <EM>Michael G.</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
214 Conn. App. 358, 280 A.3d 501
(2022), vacated, 348 Conn. 946, 308 A.3d 35
(2024), and, therefore, concluded that, "in
light of binding case law, [the petitioner]
cannot demonstrate good cause for the
untimely filing of the instant habeas petition."
Accordingly, the habeas court dismissed
the petition. The petitioner filed a
petition for certification to appeal, which
the court subsequently granted.

<P20>Approximately one year later,
while this appeal was pending, our Supreme
Court issued its decision in <EM>Rose</EM> v.
<EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra, 348
Conn. 333, 304 A.3d 431. In <EM>Rose,</EM> the court
discussed several factors relevant to the
good cause determination under &sect; 52-470(e).
Id.
<SPage 663>
at 343, 304 A.3d 431. "These
factors include, but are not limited to: (1)
whether external forces outside the control
of the petitioner had any bearing on the
delay; (2) whether and to what extent the
petitioner or his counsel bears any personal
responsibility for any excuse proffered
for the untimely filing; (3) whether the
reasons proffered by the petitioner in support
of a finding of good cause are credible
and are supported by evidence in the record;
and (4) how long after the expiration
of the filing deadline did the petitioner file
the petition.... No single factor is dispositive,
and, in ascertaining whether good
cause exists, the habeas court must consider
all relevant factors in light of the totality
of the facts and circumstances presented."
(Citation omitted; internal quotation
marks omitted.) Id.

<P20>In determining whether deficient
performance of counsel may constitute
good cause under &sect; 52-470(e), our Supreme
Court turned to the distinction between
internal and external factors that
cause or contribute to the failure to comply
with a procedural rule. Id. at 347, 304 A.3d
431. Specifically, the court noted that, in
the context of the procedural default doctrine,
"[<EM>i</EM>]<EM>neffective assistance of counsel is
an objective factor external to the defense
because the</EM> [<EM>s</EM>]<EM>ixth</EM> [<EM>a</EM>]<EM>mendment itself requires
that responsibility for the default be
imputed to the</EM> [<EM>s</EM>]<EM>tate.</EM>... In other words,
it is not the gravity of the attorney's error
that matters, but that it constitutes a violation
of [the] petitioner's right to counsel, so
that the error must be seen as an external
factor, i.e., imputed to the [s]tate.... Although
a petitioner is bound by his counsel's
inadvertence, ignorance, or tactical
missteps ... <EM>a petitioner is not bound by
the ineffective assistance of his counsel.</EM>"
(Citation omitted; emphasis added; internal
quotation marks omitted.) Id. at 347-48,
304 A.3d 431. It then concluded: "Consistent
with this authority, we conclude
that ineffective assistance of counsel is an
objective factor external to the petitioner
that may constitute
<SPage 664>
good cause to excuse
the late filing of a habeas petition
under the totality of the circumstances
pursuant to &sect; 52-470(c) and (e)." Id. at
348, 304 A.3d 431; see also <EM>Rapp</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> supra, 224 Conn.
App. at 343, 311 A.3d 249. Consistent with
the principles set forth in <EM>Rose</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> supra, 348 Conn. 333,
304 A.3d 431, we conclude that the habeas
court, through no fault of its own, did not
apply the correct legal standard later set
forth in <EM>Rose</EM> when deciding whether the
petitioner had demonstrated good cause
for the late filing of his petition. See <EM>Hankerson</EM>
v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra,
223 Conn. App. at 569, 308 A.3d 1113.
As noted by the court in <EM>Rose,</EM> actions of
counsel that are ineffective under the sixth
amendment cannot be imputed to the petitioner
and, therefore, the ineffective assistance
of counsel constitutes an external,
objective factor sufficient to establish good
cause for the untimely filing. See <EM>Rose</EM> v.
<EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra, at 346,
<Page 442>
304 A.3d 431. Accordingly, the petitioner is
entitled to a new hearing at which the
habeas court must apply the proper legal
standard with respect to &sect; 52-470(d) and
(e). Id. at 350, 304 A.3d 431; see also
<EM>Coney</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra,
225 Conn. App. at 454, 315 A.3d 1161;
<EM>Michael G.</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
supra, 225 Conn. App. at 343, 314 A.3d
659; <EM>Rapp</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
supra, 224 Conn. App. at 344, 311 A.3d 249.

<P20>The judgment is reversed and the case
is remanded for further proceedings consistent
with this opinion.

<P20>In this opinion the other judges
concurred.
<FN>
<fnt1> General Statutes &sect; 52-470 provides in relevant
part: "(d) In the case of a petition filed
subsequent to a judgment on a prior petition
challenging the same conviction, there shall
be a rebuttable presumption that the filing of
the subsequent petition has been delayed
without good cause if such petition is filed
after the later of the following: (1) Two years
after the date on which the judgment in the
prior petition is deemed to be a final judgment
due to the conclusion of appellate review
or the expiration of the time for seeking
such review; (2) October 1, 2014; or (3) two
years after the date on which the constitutional
or statutory right asserted in the petition
was initially recognized and made retroactive
pursuant to a decision of the Supreme Court
or Appellate Court of this state or the Supreme
Court of the United States or by the
enactment of any public or special act. For
the purposes of this section, the withdrawal of
a prior petition challenging the same conviction
shall not constitute a judgment. The time
periods set forth in this subsection shall not
be tolled during the pendency of any other
petition challenging the same conviction.
Nothing in this subsection shall create or enlarge
the right of the petitioner to file a subsequent
petition under applicable law.

<P20>"(e) In a case in which the rebuttable presumption
of delay under subsection (c) or (d)
of this section applies, the court, upon the
request of the respondent [the Commissioner
of Correction], shall issue an order to show
cause why the petition should be permitted to
proceed. The petitioner or, if applicable, the
petitioner's counsel, shall have a meaningful
opportunity to investigate the basis for the
delay and respond to the order. If, after such
opportunity, the court finds that the petitioner
has not demonstrated good cause for the delay,
the court shall dismiss the petition. For
the purposes of this subsection, good cause
includes, but is not limited to, the discovery of
new evidence which materially affects the
merits of the case and which could not have
been discovered by the exercise of due diligence
in time to meet the requirements of
subsection (c) or (d) of this section...."

<fnt2> At oral argument before this court, counsel
for the respondent, the Commissioner of Correction,
asserted that a remand is not required
in the present case because the approximately
six year delay in filing the habeas
petition underlying this appeal could not, as a
matter of law, constitute good cause under
&sect; 52-470(e). We disagree. Whether good
cause exists for a petitioner's late filing is left
to the discretion of the habeas court, taking
into consideration the factors set forth in <EM>Kelsey</EM>
v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 343 Conn.
424, 442-43, 274 A.3d 85 (2022). The length
of the delay is just one of the factors for the
court to consider.

<P20>Counsel for the respondent also contended
that, in the event that we determined that a
remand was required, such a proceeding
should be limited to an evaluation by the
habeas court of whether prior habeas counsel
rendered ineffective assistance that constituted
good cause pursuant to &sect; 52-470(e) on the
basis of the existing record. Counsel for the
petitioner countered that such an approach
would be contrary to <EM>Rose</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of
Correction,</EM> supra, 348 Conn. 333, 304 A.3d
431. In that case, our Supreme Court stated
that the habeas court "made no factual findings
regarding [the] alleged ineffective assistance,
and, in the absence of such findings,
we will not address the issue for the first time
on appeal." Id. at 349, 304 A.3d 431. It then
remanded the case for a new hearing and
good cause determination. Id. at 350, 304
A.3d 431.

<P20>We are not persuaded by the efforts of the
respondent to distinguish the present case
from <EM>Rose</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra,
348 Conn. 333, 304 A.3d 431, and its
progeny, and note that we are bound to follow
the precedent from both our Supreme Court
and other panels of this court. See <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>White,</EM> 215 Conn. App. 273, 304-305, 283
A.3d 542 (2022), cert. denied, 346 Conn. 918,
291 A.3d 108 (2023). Accordingly, we follow
the path of those cases and remand the case
for a new hearing and good cause determination.

[MT]
<P20>The plaintiff, Nhan Vu, appeals from
the judgment of the trial court denying his
motion to open the judgment of dismissal
rendered in favor of the self-represented
defendant, N. L. On appeal, the plaintiff
claims that the court abused its discretion
in denying his motion to open. We affirm
the judgment of the trial court.

<P20>The relevant facts are not in dispute. On
September 7, 2022, the plaintiff commenced
a civil action against the defendant
sounding in theft and breach of fiduciary
duty. The return date specified on his summons
and complaint was September 20,
2022. On that date, the plaintiff filed his
return of service.

<P20>On October 17, 2022, the defendant filed
a motion to dismiss predicated on the
plaintiff's failure to comply with General
Statutes &sect; 52-46a, which requires process
in civil actions to be returned to the clerk
of the Superior Court "at least six days
before the return day." There is no indication
in the record that the court acted on
that motion to dismiss.

<P20>On October 27, 2022, the plaintiff filed a
"motion for leave to amend the return date
on the summons and
<SPage 352>
complaint."<fnr1> In
that motion, the plaintiff requested permission
to amend his complaint to specify a
revised return date of November 8, 2022.
The defendant filed an objection to that
request, in which she averred that the
claims set forth in the complaint were (1)
"factually untrue" and (2) barred by the
statute of limitations contained in General
Statutes &sect; 52-577. On November 22, 2022,
the court overruled the defendant's objection,
stating that the defendant had provided
an "[i]mproper legal basis to object to a
request to amend." At the same time,
<Page 444>
there is no indication in the record that the
court granted the plaintiff's motion for
leave to amend his summons and complaint.

<P20>On December 14, 2022, the defendant,
now represented by counsel, filed an
amended motion to dismiss the plaintiff's
original complaint on the ground that the
process was not returned to the clerk of
the Superior Court at least six days before
the return date, as required by &sect; 52-46a.<fnr2>
On January 24, 2023, the plaintiff requested
<SPage 353>
a continuance of argument on the
defendant's motion to dismiss at short calendar.
The court granted that continuance
request and thereafter ordered an "in person
hearing" on the defendant's motion,
which was scheduled for March 20, 2023.
(Emphasis omitted.)

<P20>It is undisputed that both the defendant
and her legal counsel appeared in court for
the scheduled hearing on March 20, 2023.
The plaintiff also appeared and filed another
motion for a continuance at that time,
stating that his counsel was out of state.
<Page 445>
The court granted that continuance request
as well.

<P20>The hearing on the motion to dismiss
was rescheduled and ultimately held on
April 17, 2023. Neither the
<SPage 354>
plaintiff nor
his counsel appeared at that hearing. By
order dated April 17, 2023, the court stated:
"The motion to dismiss is granted with
prejudice. The plaintiff did not file an opposition
to the motion to dismiss nor appear
at the hearing, which was duly noticed
and scheduled, on April 17, 2023.
Accordingly, a judgment of dismissal shall
enter."<fnr3>

<P20>On May 8, 2023, the plaintiff filed a
motion to open the judgment of dismissal
pursuant to General Statutes &sect; 52-212a
and Practice Book &sect; 17-4, alleging that his
"failure to appear or oppose the motion to
dismiss resulted from mistake, accident,
inadvertence, reasonable cause, or excusable
neglect...." In support thereof, the
plaintiff's counsel, Attorney Clifford S.
Thier, provided an affidavit, in which he
stated that his travel on March 21, 2023,
his subsequent positive test for COVID-19
on March 22, 2023, and his "brain fog"
allegedly related to COVID-19 caused him
to calendar the wrong date of the April 17,
2023 hearing.

<P20>On May 17, 2023, the defendant,
again acting in a self-represented capacity,
filed an objection to the plaintiff's motion
to open the judgment of dismissal. In that
objection, the defendant argued, inter alia,
that, because the plaintiff's counsel "receives
reminders via mail, email, text,
etc.," his failure to appear for the April 17,
2023 hearing was "inexcusable." The defendant
also stated that, when she appeared
at court on March 20, 2023, she
witnessed the plaintiff at "the clerk's office
confirming that the hearing [on the motion
to dismiss] would
<SPage 355>
be rescheduled for
April 17, 2023, at 10:30 a.m." In addition,
the defendant averred that the plaintiff
had brought a prior action against her that
was "essentially about the same" subject
matter, which action too resulted in a judgment
of dismissal in her favor.<fnr4>

<P20>The plaintiff filed a reply to the defendant's
objection on May 22, 2023, and the
defendant filed a surreply on June 12,
2023. The court heard argument from the
parties on June 26, 2023. The court thereafter
denied the motion to open, finding
that (1) "the plaintiff had sufficient notice
and opportunity to respond to the motion
to dismiss," (2) the plaintiff had not addressed
"his numerous opportunities to respond
to the motion to dismiss" in light of
the multiple continuances that the court
<Page 446>
had granted, and (3) the plaintiff had not
shown that the dismissal was "based on
mistake, error or excusable neglect." From
that judgment, the plaintiff now appeals.

<P20>On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the
court improperly denied his motion to open
the judgment of dismissal. We disagree.

<P20>It is well established that the
courts of this state "have the inherent
authority to open, correct or modify judgments,
but this authority is restricted by
statute and the rules of practice.... Pursuant
to [&sect;] 52-212a, a civil judgment may
not be opened unless a motion to open is
filed within four months following the date
on
<SPage 356>
which it was rendered. When a motion
to open is timely filed, our review is
limited to whether the court has acted
unreasonably or has abused its discretion."

Water Mountain Resorts of Connecticut,
Inc.,</EM> 133 Conn. App. 536, 541, 37 A.3d 766
(2012). "A motion to open ... a judgment
... is addressed to the [trial] court's discretion,
and the action of the trial court
will not be disturbed on appeal unless it
acted unreasonably and in clear abuse of
its discretion.... In determining whether
the trial court abused its discretion, this
court must make every reasonable presumption
in favor of its action.... The
manner in which [this] discretion is exercised
will not be disturbed so long as the
court could reasonably conclude as it did."
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Bhatia</EM>
v. <EM>Debek,</EM> 287 Conn. 397, 417, 948 A.2d
1009 (2008).

<P20>On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the
affidavit provided by Thier demonstrates
that his failure to appear at the April 17,
2023 hearing was due to "a calendaring
error," which authorized the court to set
aside the judgment of dismissal. In so
arguing, the plaintiff relies on <EM>Trumbull</EM> v.
<EM>Palmer,</EM> 161 Conn. App. 594, 129 A.3d 133
(2015), cert. denied, 320 Conn. 923, 133
A.3d 458 (2016), for the proposition that a
trial court "may set aside the dismissal
upon a timely motion explaining that the
error resulted from a mistake...."<fnr5>

<P20>We do not disagree with the plaintiff in
that regard. Our precedent recognizes that
the trial court is empowered to grant a
timely motion to open a judgment of dismissal
upon such a showing, as <EM>Trumbull</EM>
illustrates. See <EM>Trumbull</EM> v. <EM>Palmer,</EM> supra,
161 Conn. App. at 600, 129 A.3d 133. At
<SPage 357>
the same time, while a court <EM>may</EM> grant
a motion to open a judgment in such circumstances,
it is under no obligation to do
so. Rather, the court retains discretion to
grant a motion to open in light of the
particular facts and procedural history of
each case.<fnr6> See <EM>Rzayeva</EM> v. <EM>75 Oxford
Street, LLC,</EM> 111 Conn. App. 77, 78, 957
A.2d 539 (2008) ("[w]hether to grant a
motion to open [a judgment of dismissal]
rests in the discretion of the trial court").
<Page 447>

<P20>In the present case, the plaintiff
attributes an alleged mistake on the part
of Thier in calendaring the April 17, 2023
hearing due to his travel on March 21,
2023, his subsequent positive test for COVID-19
on March 22, 2023, and his related
"brain fog." Although that alleged mistake
may explain his failure to appear at the
April 17, 2023 hearing, it does not explain
his failure to respond in any manner to the
defendant's amended motion to dismiss for
more than three months prior to his travel
in late March and subsequent illness, well
beyond the thirty day time period specified
in our rules of practice for parties to respond
to motions to dismiss. See Practice
Book &sect; 10-31(a).

<P20>In ruling on the motion to open, the
trial court expressly found that "the plaintiff
had sufficient notice and opportunity to
respond to the motion to dismiss" and
emphasized that he had not addressed "his
numerous opportunities to respond to the
motion to dismiss"
<SPage 358>
in light of the multiple
continuances that had been granted by
the court. Because the explanation provided
in Thier's affidavit pertained solely to
events occurring after March 20, 2023, the
court reasonably could have concluded that
it did not excuse the plaintiff's failure to
respond to the defendant's amended motion
to dismiss in the previous three
months. Moreover, because this court presumes
that the trial court undertook the
proper analysis of the law; see <EM>White</EM> v.
<EM>FCW Law Offices,</EM> 228 Conn. App. 1, 8, 323
A.3d 406 (2024); we presume that the court
was aware that, under Connecticut law,
our trial courts are authorized to render a
judgment of dismissal in response to the
failure of a party or its counsel to appear
at a scheduled court proceeding. See <EM>Rzayeva</EM>
v. <EM>75 Oxford Street, LLC,</EM> supra, 111
Conn. App. at 78, 957 A.2d 539 (trial court
rendered judgment of dismissal "after the
plaintiff failed to attend the hearing on the
motion to dismiss"); <EM>Talit</EM> v. <EM>Northwest
Airlines, Inc.,</EM> 58 Conn. App. 102, 107, 752
A.2d 1131 (2000) (trial court rendered
judgment of dismissal after "[the] plaintiff
and her counsel failed to appear for a
status conference").

<P20>In addition, our Supreme Court has observed
that it is "well within the power of
the trial court to take judicial notice of
court files of other suits between the same
parties...." <EM>Carpenter</EM> v. <EM>Planning &
Zoning Commission,</EM> 176 Conn. 581, 591,
409 A.2d 1029 (1979). Here, the court may
have taken judicial notice of the fact that
the plaintiff's prior civil action against the
defendant involving a similar set of facts
was dismissed by the trial court as a
"sanction" for the plaintiff's failure to appear
at a scheduled trial management conference;
see footnote 4 of this opinion;
particularly in light of the fact that the
defendant apprised the court of that prior
action in her objection to the motion to
open.

<P20>Furthermore, we reiterate that the
plaintiff did not seek an articulation from
the trial court in this case.
<SPage 359>
See footnote
2 of this opinion. As a result, we may
presume that the court, in granting the
defendant's December 14, 2022 motion to
dismiss the plaintiff's original complaint,
determined that the defendant's motion
was meritorious in light of the plaintiff's
conceded noncompliance with &sect; 52-46a
with respect to his original complaint. See,
e.g., <EM>Orcutt</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
284 Conn. 724, 739 n.25, 937 A.2d 656
(2007) ("in the absence of an articulation
... [an appellate court will] presume that
the trial court acted properly"); <EM>Young</EM> v.
<EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 104 Conn.
App. 188, 190 n.1, 932 A.2d 467 (2007)
(when decision lacks specificity, Appellate
Court presumes trial court made necessary
findings and determinations supported
by record on which judgment is
<Page 448>
predicated), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 907,
942 A.2d 416 (2008).

<P20>A challenge to the propriety of a court's
decision to deny a motion to open a judgment
of dismissal is reviewed pursuant to
the abuse of discretion standard. See
<EM>Rzayeva</EM> v. <EM>75 Oxford Street, LLC,</EM> supra,
111 Conn. App. at 78, 957 A.2d 539. Under
that standard, "the action of the trial court
will not be disturbed on appeal unless it
acted unreasonably and in clear abuse of
its discretion.... In determining whether
the trial court abused its discretion, this
court must make every reasonable presumption
in favor of its action.... The
manner in which [this] discretion is exercised
will not be disturbed so long as the
court could reasonably conclude as it did."
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Bhatia</EM>
v. <EM>Debek,</EM> supra, 287 Conn. at 417, 948 A.2d
1009. On our review of the record before
us, we cannot conclude that the court
abused its discretion in denying the motion
to open.

<P20>The judgment is affirmed.

<P20>In this opinion the other judges
concurred.
<FN>
<fnt*> In accordance with federal law; see 18 U.S.C.
&sect; 2265 (d) (3) (2018), as amended by the
Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization
Act of 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-103, &sect; 106, 136
Stat. 49, 851; we decline to identify any person
protected or sought to be protected under
a protection order, protective order, or a restraining
order that was issued or applied for,
or others through whom that person's identity
may be ascertained.

<fnt1> Because more than thirty days had passed
since the return day, the plaintiff was not
permitted to amend his complaint as of right.
See Practice Book &sect; 10-59. He therefore was
required under our rules of practice to obtain
permission to do so "[b]y order of judicial
authority...." See Practice Book &sect; 10-60.

<fnt2> On appeal, the plaintiff contends that his
October 27, 2022 filing of a request to amend
his original complaint and summons rendered
the defendant's December 14, 2022 amended
motion to dismiss "moot ab initio" because
any defects in his original complaint had been
cured by that filing. The plaintiff has provided
this court with no authority for that proposition
in the context of amendments sought
pursuant to Practice Book &sect; 10-60. Although
the plaintiff was permitted under our rules of
practice to amend any defect in his original
complaint as of right "during the first thirty
days after the return day"; Practice Book
&sect; 10-59; he did not do so. Instead, he filed a
request for leave to amend his original complaint
beyond that time period pursuant to
Practice Book &sect; 10-60 on October 27, 2022.
Because the defendant did not consent to that
request and filed an objection thereto, the
plaintiff was obligated under our rules of
practice to secure an "order of judicial authority"
to permit the requested amendment.
See Practice Book &sect; 10-60 (a) (1). The record
before us lacks such an order by the court.

<P20>To be sure, the court overruled the defendant's
objection to the plaintiff's request. The
court nevertheless did not grant the plaintiff's
request to amend his original complaint or
enter an order to that effect. Rather, the court
simply stated that the defendant had set forth
an "[i]mproper legal basis to object to a request
to amend." There also is no indication
in the record that the plaintiff affirmatively
attempted to obtain a ruling from the court
on his request for permission to amend his
original complaint. As a result, the record
lacks any ruling by the court on that request.
See, e.g., <EM>Acadia Ins. Co.</EM> v. <EM>O'Reilly,</EM> 138
Conn. App. 413, 415, 53 A.3d 1026 (2012) (no
indication in record that trial court ever acted
on plaintiff's request for permission to amend
complaint), cert. denied, 308 Conn. 904, 61
A.3d 1097 (2013).

<P20>"It is well established that [i]t is the appellant's
burden to provide an adequate record
for review.... It is, therefore, the responsibility
of the appellant to move for an articulation
or rectification of the record ... to ask the
trial judge to rule on an overlooked matter."
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <EM>McCarthy</EM>
v. <EM>Chromium Process Co.,</EM> 127 Conn. App. 324,
335, 13 A.3d 715 (2011). The plaintiff in the
present case did not request an articulation
from the trial court as to the basis of its April
17, 2023 decision and whether it had concluded
that his original complaint remained
operative. Because the court granted the defendant's
December 14, 2022 amended motion
to dismiss <EM>the plaintiff's original complaint,</EM>
we reasonably may presume that the
court determined that the defendant's October
27, 2022 request to amend his original
complaint had not been granted and that his
original complaint remained operative. See,
e.g., <EM>White</EM> v. <EM>Latimer Point Condominium
Assn., Inc.,</EM> 191 Conn. App. 767, 780-81, 216
A.3d 830 (2019) ("This court will neither
speculate with regard to the rationale underlying
the court's decision nor, in the absence
of a record that demonstrates that error exists,
presume that the court acted erroneously....
[We] do not presume error; the trial
court's ruling is entitled to the reasonable
presumption that it is correct unless the party
challenging the ruling has satisfied its burden
demonstrating the contrary." (Citations omitted;
internal quotation marks omitted.)). This
case, therefore, is not one in which the defendant's
amended motion to dismiss was patently
meritless, as the plaintiff suggests.

<fnt3> In his appellate brief, the plaintiff argues
that it is improper for a trial court to render a
judgment of dismissal in response to the failure
of a party or its counsel to appear at a
scheduled court proceeding. The precedent of
this court indicates otherwise. See <EM>Rzayeva</EM> v.
<EM>75 Oxford Street, LLC,</EM> 111 Conn. App. 77, 78,
957 A.2d 539 (2008) (trial court rendered
judgment of dismissal "after the plaintiff
failed to attend the hearing on the motion to
dismiss"); <EM>Talit</EM> v. <EM>Northwest Airlines, Inc.,</EM> 58
Conn. App. 102, 107, 752 A.2d 1131 (2000)
(trial court rendered judgment of dismissal
after "[the] plaintiff and her counsel failed to
appear for a status conference").

<fnt4> "It is well established that an appellate
court may take judicial notice of the court
files in another suit between the parties...."
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Ammar I.</EM>
v. <EM>Evelyn W.,</EM> 227 Conn. App. 827, 835 n.9,
323 A.3d 1111 (2024). We note that, by order
dated March 2, 2022, the trial court rendered
a judgment of dismissal in favor of the defendant
in the plaintiff's prior civil action against
her "as a sanction for the plaintiff's failure to
appear for the trial management conference
after receiving notice of the conference...."
<EM>Vu</EM> v. <EM>Lewis,</EM> Superior Court, judicial district
of New Britain, Docket No. CV-21-5029878-S
(March 2, 2022). The plaintiff did not challenge
the propriety of that judgment of dismissal
by way of appeal to this court.

<fnt5> <EM>Trumbull</EM> did not involve a challenge to the
trial court's exercise of its discretion to grant
a motion to open. The issue in that case was
whether the court lacked authority to do so.
See <EM>Trumbull</EM> v. <EM>Palmer,</EM> supra, 161 Conn.
App. at 596, 129 A.3d 133.

<fnt6> The particular facts and procedural history
surrounding a judgment of dismissal are critical
considerations in a court's determination
as to whether to exercise its discretion to
grant a motion to open. For example, we note
that <EM>Trumbull,</EM> like the present case, involved
a plaintiff's attorney who mistakenly believed
a court proceeding was scheduled on a different
day. See <EM>Trumbull</EM> v. <EM>Palmer,</EM> supra, 161
Conn. App. at 597, 129 A.3d 133. <EM>Prior</EM> to
receiving any notice that a judgment of dismissal
had been rendered in that case, the
plaintiff's attorney "realized his mistake, contacted
the court, and [then] learned of the
dismissal." Id. In the present case, by contrast,
it was only <EM>after</EM> receiving notice of the
judgment of dismissal that Thier raised the
issue of the alleged mistake on his part.

<P20>The defendant, Jesse Lee Miller, appeals
from the judgment of conviction, rendered
after a jury trial, of attempt to
commit assault in the first degree in violation
<Page 454>
of General Statutes &sect;&sect; 53a-49 (a) (2)<fnr1>
and 53a-59 (a) (1),<fnr2> and assault in the
second degree in violation of General Statutes
&sect; 53a-60 (a) (2).<fnr3> On appeal, the defendant
claims that (1) the court improperly
denied his motion to suppress, (2) the
court erroneously admitted certain expert
testimony, and (3) there was insufficient
evidence to support his convictions. We
affirm the judgment of the court.

<P20>The following procedural history and
facts, as the jury reasonably could have
found them, are relevant to this appeal.
The victim, Rupert Beckford, had known
the defendant since the latter was a child.
On the afternoon of August 9, 2021, the
victim traveled by car from the Island
Spice restaurant in New Haven to Waterbury,
accompanied by Kenyatta Folkes,
Hope Woodson, and Folkes' brother. After
dropping off Folkes' brother in Waterbury,
Folkes, Woodson, and the victim returned
to New Haven and parked the car across
from Island Spice. Folkes had been driving,
with Woodson in the front passenger
seat, and the victim in the back seat
<SPage 438>
on
the passenger side. Woodson exited the
car first and walked toward Island Spice.
As the victim was moving to exit the car,
the defendant approached the car, pulled
open the door, placed his foot inside the
car between the victim's legs, and began to
punch him and thrust a screwdriver toward
his chest. The victim attempted to
push the defendant away from him and to
shield himself from the thrusted screwdriver.
The attack was unprovoked. The victim
had heart stents and was sixty-five
years old at the time of the offense; at the
time of trial, he was approximately five
feet, four inches tall and weighed 190
pounds. The defendant was slightly more
than six feet tall and weighed more than
200 pounds.

<P20>While the attack was occurring, a group
of bystanders converged around the car.
Folkes jumped out of the car, at which
point the defendant moved away from the
car and began walking toward the middle
of the street. As he did so, the defendant
said: "I got him, I got him, who else wants
it, I got him." A bystander approached the
defendant swinging a baseball bat, and
Folkes picked up some stones and threw
them at the defendant, knocking the
screwdriver out of his hand. The defendant
then walked down the street and away
from the scene. Woodson called 911.

<P20>Officer Brandon Cain of the New Haven
Police Department was dispatched to the
scene at approximately 5:40 p.m. He located
the defendant farther down the street
and placed him in handcuffs. Cain had
consistently patrolled the area in which the
attack occurred since 2016 and had interacted
with the defendant approximately
once per week leading up to the date of
the offense.
<Page 455>

<P20>The victim sustained a one centimeter
superficial laceration to the right side of
his chest&mdash;over the area where his lungs
and heart were located&mdash;as well as small
superficial lacerations to his right forearm.
He
<SPage 439>
was transported via ambulance to
Yale-New Haven Hospital (hospital),
where he was admitted to the emergency
department at 6:28 p.m. and discharged
thirty minutes later. He received Bacitracin
and a Band-Aid for his injuries, which
were not life-threatening.

<P20>The defendant was tried before a jury of
six over two days on March 3 and 6, 2023.
On March 6, 2023, the jury returned a
verdict of guilty of both charges. On May
2, 2023, the court, <EM>Alander, J.,</EM> sentenced
the defendant to a total effective sentence
of eleven years of incarceration, suspended
after six years (of which five were a mandatory
minimum), followed by five years of
probation. This appeal followed. Additional
facts and procedural history will be set
forth as necessary.

<CN>I

<P20>The defendant first claims that the court
improperly denied his motion to suppress
the screwdriver used in the assault of the
victim. He argues that the screwdriver
should not have been admitted as evidence
because there was a break in the chain of
custody, and the state thus failed to meet
its burden of establishing the screwdriver's
authenticity. We are not persuaded.

<P20>The following additional facts and procedural
history are relevant to this claim. On
March 2, 2023, the eve of trial, the defendant
filed a motion to suppress the screwdriver,
in which he averred that the evidence
was "tainted" because "the chain of
custody ... was broken when [the screwdriver]
was commingled with other articles,
thus causing the [screwdriver] to be
tampered with." The court held an evidentiary
hearing on this motion on March 3,
2023, before the start of evidence in the
defendant's trial. The state presented the
testimony of one witness at the hearing,
Sergeant Scott Shumway of the New Haven
Police Department; the defendant did
not call any witnesses.
<SPage 440>

<P20>Shumway testified that he was dispatched
to the location of the incident on
August 9, 2021. Other officers were already
present at the scene when he arrived,
and one of them identified a screwdriver
lying on the pavement in a parking
lot as the weapon that had been used in
the incident. Shumway picked up the
screwdriver and placed it loosely in the
trunk of his police cruiser. He did not put
the screwdriver in an evidence bag at the
scene. The trunk contained large bags and
other tools. Shumway did not recall that
there were any other screwdrivers in the
trunk. After placing the screwdriver in his
trunk, Shumway drove directly from the
scene to police headquarters, where he
logged the screwdriver into evidence with
the front desk sergeant. The screwdriver
was placed in a box used to log knives and
other sharp objects into evidence. The
state showed this box, which contained a
screwdriver, to Shumway on the stand,
and asked him whether the screwdriver it
contained was the same one he had recovered
from the scene. Shumway testified,
"[w]ith a high degree of certainty," that
the screwdriver in the box was the same
screwdriver that he had picked up from
the parking lot at the scene of the incident
and logged into evidence.

<P20>Following Shumway's testimony and
brief argument by the parties, the court
orally denied the defendant's motion to
suppress. The court explained its ruling: "I
think based&mdash;given [Shumway's] testimony
that he's highly certain that that's the
screwdriver that he ... picked up from
the parking lot, put it in his trunk, and
then ... took it&mdash;there doesn't seem to be
<Page 456>
a chain of custody issue here. I mean, he
testified that he picked that screwdriver
up from the parking lot, put it in his trunk,
took it to the police station, had it logged
into the ... evidence room. He testified
that he's highly certain that that is the
screwdriver. There's ... no evidence before
me that it's&mdash;that either it's been
altered or changed or exchanged or it's
just the wrong
<SPage 441>
screwdriver. I think
based on that testimony I'm [going to]
allow the state to elicit that evidence."<fnr4>

<P20>We begin with the relevant principles
of law and standard of review. In
order to be admissible, evidence must be
authenticated; that is, the offering party
must put forth evidence sufficient to support
a finding that the proffered evidence
is what its proponent claims it to be. Conn.
Code Evid. &sect; 9-1 (a). "To establish a foundation
for admission, [a]n item offered as
real evidence must be positively identified
as the item in question. This can be done
by establishing unique or distinguishable
configurations, marks, or other characteristics,
or by satisfactory proof of the item's
chain of custody from the time of the
incident to the time of trial." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Dearborn,</EM>
82 Conn. App. 734, 744-45, 846 A.2d
894, cert. denied, 270 Conn. 904, 853 A.2d
523 (2004). The chain of custody will generally
be established by "testimony that
traces the ... custody of the item from the
moment it was found to its appearance in

<P20>Shumway's testimony was sufficient
to establish a reasonable probability
that the screwdriver was the one found at
the scene. Shumway testified that he
picked up the screwdriver at the scene, put
it in the trunk of his police cruiser, and
transported it directly to police headquarters,
where he logged it into evidence.
Although he testified that there were other
items in the trunk, he did not recall there
being any other screwdrivers with which
the screwdriver used in the underlying
assault could have been confused. Significantly,
after being shown the screwdriver
that the state intended to offer into evidence
on the stand, he testified that he had
a "high degree of certainty" that that
screwdriver was the one he had recovered
from the scene. His testimony was sufficient
to establish a reasonable probability
that the screwdriver the state intended to
offer into evidence was the one found at
the scene and that it had neither been
changed nor altered, and thereby to authenticate
it.<fnr5> Accordingly, we conclude
that the court did not abuse its discretion
in denying the defendant's motion to suppress.<fnr6>
<SPage 444>

<CN>II

<P20>The defendant next claims that the
court erred by permitting the state's expert
witness, Vivek Parwani, the medical
director of the department of emergency
medicine at the hospital where the victim
was transported, to testify as to the injuries
that could have been caused by
thrusting a screwdriver into a person's
chest. In particular, he contends that (1)
Parwani's testimony constituted an impermissible
opinion on an ultimate issue and
(2) the hypothetical question to which Parwani
responded omitted an essential material
fact, namely, that the hypothetical assailant
was intoxicated at the time of the
incident. In response, the state argues that
the defendant failed to preserve his claim
regarding the admission of testimony on
an ultimate issue at trial and that its hypothetical
<Page 458>
question to Parwani was not improper.
We agree with the state.

<P20>The following additional facts and procedural
history are relevant to this claim. At
trial, the defendant did not contest that he
had attacked the victim with a screwdriver
but argued that he was intoxicated at the
time of the incident and that his intoxication
negated the intent necessary to
prove him guilty of either charged offense.
The state vigorously disputed this contention.
Woodson and Folkes both testified
that, on the day of the incident, the defendant
had been drinking. Woodson also testified,
however, that, after the attack, she
did not observe the defendant stumbling
over himself and was not sure whether he
was slurring his words. Officer Cain testified
that he knew the area of the incident
to be the defendant's regular drinking spot
and that he had observed the defendant
drinking there during most of their prior
interactions. He also testified, however,
that, on the day of the incident, he did not
observe the defendant showing any visible
signs of intoxication, such as poor balance
or slurred speech, and that the
<SPage 445>
defendant was able to listen to his commands
and provide clear answers to his
questions.

<P20>On the first day of evidence, the state
called Parwani to testify as an expert witness.
Parwani testified that, on the day of
the incident, he was working as an emergency
room physician and examined the
victim on his arrival at the hospital. He
further testified that the victim's injuries
were consistent with having been stabbed
and that the victim's statements to him
and to other hospital personnel were consistent
with his injuries. The following exchange
ensued during Parwani's direct examination:

<P20>"[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Given the location
of where [the victim] was stabbed,
what other organs or body parts are in
that area that could have been affected?

<P20>"[The Witness]: He&mdash;he was stabbed
over the area where his lungs are located
and his heart is located.

<P20>"[The Prosecutor]: So, showing you
what's been marked as state's exhibit 5<fnr7>
as a full exhibit, given the size of that
screwdriver, given the location of the injuries
to [the victim], and given the body
parts that are in that area that could have
been affected, if that screwdriver went in
further to [the victim's] body, what could&mdash;
what could have been affected? What injuries
could have occurred?

<P20>"[Defense Counsel]: I'm&mdash;I'm [going to]
object, foundation. It's a hypothetical. And
there's&mdash;there's no evidence to&mdash;to meet
that hypothetical.

<P20>"The Court: Yeah. I still&mdash;well, let me
just check something here for a minute.

<P20>"I'm [going to] allow&mdash;I'm [going to]
allow the question. Overruled.
<SPage 446>

<P20>"[The Witness]: Can you repeat the
question?

<P20>"[The Prosecutor]: Yes. So, given&mdash;assuming
the following facts are in evidence,
given a screwdriver of that size, assume
that, showing you what's been marked as
state's exhibit 6,<fnr8> full exhibit, assume the
facts of a person over six foot, over 200
pounds thrusting the screwdriver into another
person in the area of the right
<Page 459>
breast, what injuries could have followed
from those actions?

<P20>"[The Witness]: Or if the screwdriver of
that size was thrust, as you note, into the
right breast, a patient's lungs as well as
their heart [are] located there, one could
puncture a lung; one could puncture one's
heart....

<P20>"[The Prosecutor]: Could that type of
injury cause death or a serious impairment
to the lung or the heart?

<P20>"[Defense Counsel]: I think I'm [going
to] object, Your Honor. We've taken a real
leap into&mdash;

<P20>"The Court: Well, let me excuse the jury
for a moment. Ladies and gentlemen, I
need to excuse you for one moment. I'll
have you back in here shortly.

<P20>"(Whereupon the jury panel exited the
courtroom.)

<P20>"The Court: So, under count one, the
state's charge[d] criminal attempt to commit
assault in the first degree&mdash;

<P20>"[Defense Counsel]: Assault in the first
degree.

<P20>"The Court: &mdash;one of the things they
have to prove&mdash;

<P20>"[Defense Counsel]: Is serious&mdash;

<P20>"The Court: &mdash;is that&mdash;well, is that the
defendant specifically intended to cause
serious physical injury to [the victim]. The
reason I let his opinion in as to
<SPage 447>
what&mdash;
what could have&mdash;what&mdash;what the screwdriver,
the injury that it could have caused,
where he said it could have punctured a
lung or heart; the other thing the state has
to show is that the ... that if, under the
circumstances in which the dangerous instrument
was used, it was capable of producing
serious physical injury or death. So
that's why I let that part in.

<P20>"Now, this question is&mdash;is specifically
what? What are you asking the doctor?

<P20>"[The Prosecutor]: Is&mdash;could&mdash;could an
injury to that area cause death or serious
physical injury or serious impairment to&mdash;

<P20>"The Court: Why isn't that relevant to
his intent?

<P20>"[Defense Counsel]: Why is it relevant?

<P20>"The Court: Why isn't it relevant to his
intent?

<P20>"[Defense Counsel]: It's not the relevan[ce].
It's the foundation. His expert
opinion for a hypothetical has to be based
on the evidence or testimony that's given
and it's not&mdash;there's no foundation and,
basically, my objection is on the foundation
set for that conclusion.

<P20>"The Court: Yeah. I&mdash;if that's the objection,
it's overruled. So, we can have the
jury come back, marshal.

<P20>"(Whereupon the jury panel entered the
courtroom.)...

<P20>"[The Prosecutor]: Dr. Parwani, could
that&mdash;could an injury to that area, could
that have caused death or serious impairment
to the heart or the lung?

<P20>"[The Witness]: So, just so I understand
the question and correct me if this is not
what you're asking, but if a&mdash;could a
screwdriver to the chest cause serious injury,
harm including death. If that&mdash;is that
the question?
<SPage 448>

<P20>"[The Prosecutor]: Yes.

<P20>"[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, I'm
[going to]&mdash;that's&mdash;to where that particular
spot was it may happen.

<P20>"The Court: That's my understanding is
that's the question.

<P20>"[Defense Counsel]: He&mdash;he's testifying&mdash;

<P20>"[The Prosecutor]: To his right breast
also.
<Page 460>

<P20>"The Court: Yeah. That's my question.
That's what my understanding is that's
what the question is.

<P20>"[Defense Counsel]: As long as the doctor
understands.

<P20>"[The Witness]: Yeah. That's a&mdash;a
screwdriver to the right breast, could it
cause serious injury, harm, or death, and
it&mdash;it could." (Footnotes added.)

<P20>On cross-examination, the defendant did
not ask Parwani to consider what, if any,
effect an attacker's intoxication might have
on the possible injuries that could result
from being stabbed in the chest with a
screwdriver.

<CN>A

<P20>The defendant first argues that,
when the court permitted Parwani to testify
that being stabbed with a screwdriver
could place someone at risk of serious
injury or death, it improperly allowed him
to opine on an ultimate issue reserved for
the jury. We decline to review the merits
of this claim because the defendant failed
to preserve it at trial.

<P20>"This court is not bound to
consider claims of law not made at the
trial.... Our rules of practice make it
clear that when an objection to evidence is
made, a succinct statement of the grounds
forming the basis for the objection must be
made in such form as counsel
<SPage 449>
desires it
to be preserved and included in the record
.... In objecting to evidence, counsel
must properly articulate the basis of the
objection so as to apprise the trial court of
the precise nature of the objection and its
real purpose, in order to form an adequate
basis for a reviewable ruling.... Once
counsel states the authority and ground of
his objection, any appeal will be limited to
the ground asserted.... These requirements
are not simply formalities. They
serve to alert the trial court to potential
error while there is still time for the court
to act.... Assigning error to a court's
evidentiary rulings on the basis of objections
never raised at trial unfairly subjects
the court and the opposing party to trial
by ambush." (Citations omitted; internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Bush,</EM>
249 Conn. 423, 427-28, 735 A.2d 778 (1999);
see also Practice Book &sect; 60-5.

<P20>It is clear, from our review of
the record, that at no point did the defendant
object to Parwani's testimony on the
ground that it expressed an opinion as to
an ultimate issue. Rather, he objected that
the hypothetical posed to Parwani lacked a
sufficient evidentiary foundation. These
objections entail different legal inquiries.
When a party objects on the ground that
an expert is improperly testifying as to an
ultimate issue, the court must assess
whether the expert is being asked to invade
the province of the jury by opining on
a question inseparable from the essence of
the matter to be decided by the fact finder.
See, e.g., <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Beavers,</EM> 290 Conn. 386,
414-15, 963 A.2d 956 (2009). By contrast,
when a party objects on the ground that a
hypothetical question posed to an expert
lacks a sufficient foundation, the court
must assess the extent to which the facts
assumed in that question have a basis in
the record. See, e.g., <EM>Wallace</EM> v. <EM>Saint
Francis Hospital & Medical Center,</EM> 44
Conn. App. 257, 262, 688 A.2d 352 (1997).
One objection, in other words, is meant to
preserve the integrity
<SPage 450>
of the jury's fact-finding
function; the other is designed to
ensure the probative value of the expert's
testimony. Raising the latter is not equivalent
to raising the former. See, e.g., <EM>State</EM>
v. <EM>Jose G.,</EM> 290 Conn. 331, 343-45, 963 A.2d
42 (2009) (declining to review evidentiary
objection raised for first time on appeal
when claim raised on appeal required inquiry
distinct from that required by objections
<Page 461>
raised at trial).<fnr9> As such, we decline
to review the defendant's unpreserved
claim.

<CN>B

<P20>The defendant also argues that the
hypothetical question the state posed to
Parwani&mdash;which asked him to opine on the
extent of injuries that could result from a
person more than six feet tall and weighing
more than 200 pounds thrusting a
screwdriver into another person's chest&mdash;
was improper because it omitted the allegedly
"material fact" that the hypothetical
assailant was intoxicated at the time of the
attack. He claims that the court thus erred
in permitting Parwani to opine in response
to that question. We disagree.

<P20>As a threshold matter, the defendant
did not expressly raise this objection
at trial. Though the state does not
argue that the defendant failed to preserve
this claim, a review of the record discloses
that defense counsel objected to the state's
hypothetical question only on the ground
that it lacked a sufficient foundation in the
evidence before the court. Specifically, defense
<SPage 451>
counsel stated: "I'm [going to]
object, foundation. It's a hypothetical. And
there's&mdash;there's no evidence to&mdash;to meet
that hypothetical"; and "[Parwani's] expert
opinion for a hypothetical has to be based
on the evidence or testimony that's given
and it's not&mdash;there's no foundation...."
By contrast, a claim that a hypothetical
question improperly omitted a material
fact does not question the adequacy of the
evidentiary basis on which the hypothetical
rests but, rather, asks the court to consider
whether the hypothetical has properly
and fairly marshaled and presented that
evidence. See <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>David N.J.,</EM> 301
Conn. 122, 133, 19 A.3d 646 (2011); see also
Conn. Code Evid. &sect; 7-4(c). As such, the
defendant's claim has not been properly
preserved for review.

<P20>Even if the defendant had properly
preserved his claim, however, we do not
consider it to be meritorious. See, e.g.,
<EM>Bodak</EM> v. <EM>Masotti,</EM> 14 Conn. App. 347, 350,
540 A.2d 719 (1988) (determining that
plaintiff's claim was not preserved but also
rejecting it on its merits). "An expert may
give an opinion in response to a hypothetical
question provided that the hypothetical
question (1) presents the facts in such a
manner that they bear a true and fair
relationship to each other and to the evidence
in the case, (2) is not worded so as
to mislead or confuse the jury, and (3) is
not so lacking in the essential facts as to
be without value in the decision of the
case. A hypothetical question need not contain
all of the facts in evidence." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>David
N.J.,</EM> supra, 301 Conn. at 133, 19 A.3d 646.
"The determination of the admissibility of
a hypothetical question, at least except in
extreme cases, is not to be made by the
application of any rule of thumb.... Rather,
it calls for the exercise of a sound
discretion...." (Citation omitted.) <EM>Floyd</EM>
v. <EM>Fruit Industries, Inc.,</EM> 144 Conn. 659,
666, 136 A.2d 918 (1957).
<Page 462>

<P20>The court did not abuse its discretion
in permitting Parwani to testify in
response to a hypothetical question
<SPage 452>
that
omitted any mention of intoxication. Parwani's
testimony addressed the question of
whether a person of the same height and
weight as the defendant could have caused
another person serious physical injury by
stabbing him in the chest with the screwdriver.
This testimony was relevant to
whether the screwdriver used in the assault
constituted a "dangerous instrument"
for purposes of the assault charges. See
General Statutes &sect; 53a-3 (7) (defining
"dangerous instrument" as "any instrument,
article or substance which, under
the circumstances in which it is used or
attempted or threatened to be used, is
capable of causing death or serious physical
injury"). To be sure, Parwani's opinion
that a hypothetical attacker, of similar
build to the defendant, would be capable of
causing serious physical injury to another
person also was circumstantial evidence
from which the jury could have drawn a
conclusion as to the defendant's intent at
the time of the crime. See, e.g., <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>Ortiz,</EM> 312 Conn. 551, 565, 93 A.3d 1128
(2014) (jury may, though is not required,
to infer that defendant intended natural
consequences of his voluntary conduct). It
is unclear, however, how the fact of intoxication
would have altered Parwani's conclusion
because Parwani was not actually
asked to opine, and did not opine, on the
defendant's mental state&mdash;the subject matter
to which the defendant argued that his
alleged intoxication was relevant.<fnr10> Moreover,
to the extent that the defendant's
alleged intoxication <EM>was</EM> material to Parwani's
opinion that a person of the defendant's
height and weight could cause serious
physical injury
<SPage 453>
to another person by
stabbing him in the chest with the screwdriver,
the defendant could have raised it
on cross-examination if he so chose, but he
did not. See E. Prescott, Tait's Handbook
of Connecticut Evidence (6th Ed. 2019)
&sect; 7.8.1, p. 467 ("[i]t is the function of cross-examination
to bring out the probable effect
of additional facts on a hypothetical
question"), citing <EM>Pischitto</EM> v. <EM>Waldron,</EM> 147
Conn. 171, 177, 158 A.2d 168 (1960). Especially
because a hypothetical question need
not contain all the facts in evidence, the
court reasonably could have concluded that
the state's question provided a fair summary
of the relevant evidence and that
Parwani's answer would assist the jury in
determining whether the defendant could
have caused the victim serious physical
injury by stabbing him in the chest with
the screwdriver. Therefore, the defendant's
claim fails.<fnr11>

<CN>III

<P20>Finally, the defendant claims that there
was insufficient evidence to support his
convictions. Specifically, he argues that
there was insufficient evidence that (1) he
intended to cause the victim serious physical
injury and (2) the screwdriver qualified
as a "dangerous instrument." We disagree.
<Page 463>

<P20>"It is well settled that a defendant
who asserts an insufficiency of the
evidence claim bears an arduous burden....
In reviewing a sufficiency of the
evidence claim, we apply a two part test.
First, we construe the evidence in the light
most favorable to sustaining the verdict.
Second, we determine whether upon the
facts so construed and the inferences reasonably
drawn therefrom the [jury] reasonably
could have concluded that the cumulative
force of the evidence established
<SPage 454>
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt....
This court cannot substitute its own judgment
for that of the jury if there is sufficient
evidence to support the jury's verdict....

<P20>"[T]he jury must find every element
proven beyond a reasonable doubt
in order to find the defendant guilty of the
charged offense, [but] each of the basic
and inferred facts underlying those conclusions
need not be proved beyond a reasonable
doubt.... If it is reasonable and logical
for the jury to conclude that a basic
fact or an inferred fact is true, the jury is
permitted to consider the fact proven and
may consider it in combination with other
proven facts in determining whether the
cumulative effect of all the evidence proves
the defendant guilty of all the elements of
the crime charged beyond a reasonable
doubt....

<P20>"In evaluating evidence, the [jury]
is not required to accept as dispositive
those inferences that are consistent with
the defendant's innocence.... The [jury]
may draw whatever inferences from the
evidence or facts established by the evidence
[that] it deems to be reasonable and
logical....

<P20>"Finally, on appeal, we do not ask
whether there is a reasonable view of the
evidence that would support a reasonable
hypothesis of innocence. We ask, instead,
whether there is a reasonable view of the
evidence that supports the jury's verdict of
guilty." (Citations omitted; internal quotation

(2015).

<CN>A

<P20>The defendant first claims that
there was insufficient evidence that he intended
to cause the victim serious physical
injury, as required to support his conviction
<SPage 455>
of attempt to commit assault in the
first degree. We are not persuaded.

<P20>In order to convict a defendant of
attempt to commit assault in the first degree,
in violation of &sect;&sect; 53a-49(a) (2) and
53a-59(a)(1), the state must prove that
the defendant engaged in intentional conduct
constituting a substantial step toward
intentionally causing the victim serious
physical injury by means of a dangerous
instrument. See <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Andrews,</EM> 114
Conn. App. 738, 744, 971 A.2d 63, cert.
denied, 293 Conn. 901, 975 A.2d 1277
(2009). "`Serious physical injury' means
physical injury which creates a substantial
risk of death, or which causes serious disfigurement,
serious impairment of health,
or serious loss or impairment of the function
of any bodily organ...." General
Statutes &sect; 53a-3(4); see also <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Liam
M.,</EM> 176 Conn. App. 807, 814, 172 A.3d 243,
cert. denied, 327 Conn. 978, 174 A.3d 196
(2017). [Section] 53a-3 (11) provides in relevant
part that "[a] person acts `intentionally'
with respect to a result or to conduct
described by a statute defining an offense
when his conscious objective is to cause
such result or to engage in such conduct...."

<P20>"Intent may be, and usually is,
inferred from [a] defendant's verbal or
physical conduct [as well as] the surrounding
<Page 464>
circumstances.... Nonetheless [t]here
is no distinction between circumstantial or
direct evidence so far as probative force is
concerned.... Moreover, [i]t is not one
fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude
of facts which establishes guilt in a
case involving substantial circumstantial
evidence.... Intent is a question of fact,
the determination of which should stand
unless the conclusion drawn by the trier is
an unreasonable one." (Internal quotation

<P20>On the basis of the evidence presented,
the jury could reasonably could have found
that the defendant intended to cause the
victim serious physical injury when he attacked
him with a screwdriver. The victim
testified that the defendant trapped him in
the car, "came in at [him]" with the screwdriver,
and "steadily tr[ied] to push the
screwdriver in [him]" while also striking
him in the face. He explained that, although
his wounds were minor, he only
avoided more serious injuries because he
partially shielded himself against the defendant
and because the defendant was
unable, given his size, to fit his whole body
into the car. The victim also heard bystanders
"hollering that he's killing [the
victim]." Folkes and the victim both testified
that, after the defendant ceased his
attack, he stated: "I got him." Parwani
testified that the victim was stabbed over
the area where his lungs and heart were
located, which could have killed him or
caused a serious injury such as a punctured
organ.<fnr12> Viewed cumulatively, this
evidence&mdash;in particular the weapon used,
the area in which
<SPage 457>
the defendant attempted
to stab the victim, his aggressive
demeanor during the attack, and his statement
afterward&mdash;provides a sufficient basis
from which the jury reasonably could
have inferred that the defendant acted
with the conscious objective of causing the
victim serious physical injury.

<P20>The defendant's arguments to the contrary
are not convincing. He highlights the
fact that, at certain points in his testimony,
the victim characterized the defendant's
screwdriver thrusts as "`poking' and
`pushing,' rather than a more violent action
<Page 465>
like swinging or thrusting," and argues
that this word choice suggests that the
defendant only intended to cause the victim
minor injury. The defendant, however,
ignores the fact that, elsewhere in his testimony,
the victim also described the defendant's
actions as "stabbing." Likewise,
the defendant claims that the evidence establishes
that he "cease[d] his attack ...
of his own volition" before seriously injuring
the victim and claims that, given his
own size and the victim's vulnerable position,
he "could have easily" caused the
victim serious injury "if he was intent on"
doing so. Folkes, however, testified that
the defendant only stopped attacking the
victim and backed away from the car once
Folkes jumped out of the car and ran
around toward the defendant and that the
defendant did not walk away until Folkes
knocked the screwdriver out of his hand
and a bystander swung a baseball bat at
him. The jury could reasonably have inferred
from this testimony that the defendant
was, in fact, intent on causing more
serious injury to the victim
<SPage 458>
than he
ultimately inflicted and only ceased his
attack because Folkes and others intervened.<fnr13>
Although the defendant asserts
that the fact that he "walked" away after
the attack and challenged bystanders to
fight him indicates that he was "calm,"
"unafraid of confrontation," and could not
have been "easily deterred by the likes of
[Folkes]," the jury was not required to
draw that inference, especially because
there is no indication that the defendant
attempted to resume his attack after
Folkes and the bystander confronted him.
Nor was the jury required to infer, as the
defendant insists, that when he shouted, "I
got him," he meant "that he was satisfied
with a superficial laceration." "I got him"
could just as reasonably be interpreted to
indicate that the defendant had intended to
hurt the victim badly and believed that he
had succeeded in doing so.<fnr14>

<P20>Ultimately, the defendant's arguments
boil down to a request that we view the
evidence in the light most favorable to him
and draw inferences consistent only with
his innocence, which we may not do on
sufficiency review. The evidence was sufficient
to support the jury's verdict as to the
defendant's intent to cause serious physical
injury.

<CN>B

<P20>The defendant also claims that the
evidence was insufficient to establish that
the screwdriver was a "dangerous instrument,"
as required to support his convictions
of attempted assault in the first degree
and assault in the second degree. We
disagree.
<SPage 459>

<P20>"A dangerous instrument
means any instrument, article or substance
which, under the circumstances in which it
is used or attempted or threatened to be
used, is capable of causing death or serious
physical injury.... [A] dangerous instrument
may be an ordinary object not designed
to cause death or serious physical
injury.... [E]ach case must be individually
examined to determine whether, under
the circumstances in which the object is
<Page 466>
used or threatened to be used, it has the
potential for causing serious physical injury."
(Citation omitted; emphasis omitted;
internal quotation marks omitted.) <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>Barnett,</EM> 53 Conn. App. 581, 590, 734 A.2d
991, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 919, 738 A.2d
659 (1999). "[I]t is not necessary, under
... the definition of a dangerous instrument,
that any physical injury actually
have been inflicted. It [is] only necessary
that the [instrument] have been under the
circumstances in which it was used ...
capable of causing death or serious physical
injury." (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM> 173 Conn. 91, 95,
376 A.2d 1077 (1977).

<P20>The defendant argues that, because assessing
whether an object qualifies as a
dangerous instrument requires a case-by-case
inquiry into the "circumstances in
which the object is used or threatened to
be used," it follows that the question of
whether a screwdriver is a dangerous instrument
"depends on whether the person
using it in a given circumstance intended
to cause serious physical injury or death to
another." As such, he claims, if there is
insufficient evidence of his intent to cause
serious physical injury, there must therefore
be insufficient evidence that the
screwdriver was a dangerous instrument.
We are not persuaded.

<P20>As an initial matter, we have already
concluded in part III A of this opinion that
there was sufficient evidence of the defendant's
intent to cause serious physical
<SPage 460>
injury or death. Moreover, even had we
not so concluded, this court rejected an
identical argument to the one made here in
<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Schultz,</EM> 100 Conn. App. 709, 722-23,
921 A.2d 595, cert. denied, 282 Conn.
926, 926 A.2d 668 (2007). In <EM>Schultz,</EM> the
defendant&mdash;who had been convicted of assault
in the first degree in violation of
&sect; 53a-59 (a) (1) for smashing a cocktail
glass into the victim's face&mdash;argued that
the trial court had improperly denied his
request for an instruction on a lesser included
offense, because the evidence regarding
whether the glass qualified as a
"dangerous instrument" was sufficiently in
dispute. Id., at 719-22, 921 A.2d 595. In
particular, the defendant argued that the
glass' status was sufficiently disputed because
he did not intend to inflict serious
injury when he struck the victim with it.
Id., at 722, 921 A.2d 595. This court emphasized,
however, that "[a]ny dispute concerning
the defendant's intent to cause
serious physical injury ... is not relevant
to our determination of whether it was
sufficiently in dispute that the glass was a
dangerous instrument...." Id., at 723,
921 A.2d 595. As such, our inquiry into
whether there was sufficient evidence that
the screwdriver constituted a dangerous
instrument does not depend on whether
there was sufficient evidence of the defendant's
intent to cause serious physical injury
or death.

<P20>On the basis of our review of the record
in this case, we conclude that there was
sufficient evidence in the record for the
jury to find that the screwdriver used by
the defendant constituted a dangerous instrument.
Parwani testified that a screwdriver
such as the one used in the assault
could, when thrust into someone's chest,
puncture a lung or the heart, possibly killing
that person. Such an injury clearly
meets the definition of "serious physical
injury" under &sect; 53a-3 (4), namely: "physical
injury which creates a <EM>substantial risk
of death,</EM> or which causes serious disfigurement,
<EM>serious impairment of health,</EM> or
serious <EM>loss or impairment</EM>
<SPage 461>
<EM>of the function
of any bodily organ</EM>...." (Emphasis
added.) As such, even though the victim
suffered only superficial injuries, the jury
reasonably could have found that, under
the circumstances in which the defendant
used the screwdriver&mdash;thrusting it at the
victim's chest&mdash;the screwdriver was capable
<Page 467>
of causing death or serious physical
injury. Accordingly, the defendant's claim
fails.

<P20>The judgment is affirmed.

<P20>In this opinion the other judges
concurred.
<FN>
<fnt1> General Statutes &sect; 53a-49 provides in relevant
part: "(a) A person is guilty of an attempt
to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of
mental state required for commission of the
crime, he ... (2) intentionally does or omits
to do anything which, under the circumstances
as he believes them to be, is an act or
omission constituting a substantial step in a
course of conduct planned to culminate in his
commission of the crime...."

<fnt2> General Statutes &sect; 53a-59 provides in relevant
part: "(a) A person is guilty of assault in
the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause
serious physical injury to another person, he
causes such injury to such person by means of
a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument...."

<fnt3> General Statutes &sect; 53a-60 provides in relevant
part: "(a) A person is guilty of assault in
the second degree when ... (2) with intent to
cause physical injury to another person, the
actor causes such injury to such person or to
a third person by means of a deadly weapon
or a dangerous instrument other than by
means of the discharge of a firearm...."

<fnt4> At trial, the state successfully offered the
screwdriver into evidence as a full exhibit
through the testimony of Shumway, who&mdash;
consistent with his testimony at the hearing
on the motion to suppress&mdash;identified it as the
screwdriver he had seized at the scene. The
state later showed the screwdriver to the victim,
who testified that it was the same screwdriver
with which the defendant had stabbed
him.

<fnt5> The defendant argues that, because Shumway
was certain of the screwdriver's identity
but unable to recall certain other details pertaining
to his recovery of the screwdriver&mdash;
such as the identity of the fellow officer who
told him that the screwdriver at the scene had
been used in the assault, the exact address of
the incident, or the precise location in his
trunk where he put the screwdriver&mdash;his testimony
was "utterly lacking in credibility."
However, "[i]t is axiomatic that this court
does not assess the credibility of witnesses,"
and we decline the defendant's invitation to
do so here. <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Castro,</EM> 60 Conn. App. 78,
80, 758 A.2d 470, cert. denied, 255 Conn.
912, 763 A.2d 1038 (2000).

<fnt6> Because we conclude that the admission of
the screwdriver was not an abuse of the
court's discretion, we do not reach the question
of whether its admission was harmful.
See, e.g., <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Maner,</EM> 147 Conn. App. 761,
772, 83 A.3d 1182 ("[w]hen an improper evidentiary
ruling is nonconstitutional in nature,
it is the defendant's burden to demonstrate
that such an error was harmful"), cert. denied,
311 Conn. 935, 88 A.3d 550 (2014).

<fnt7> State's exhibit 5 is a photograph depicting
the screwdriver used in the attack, positioned
next to a ruler.

<fnt8> State's exhibit 6 is the evidence box containing
the actual screwdriver used in the attack.
The state may have meant to refer to exhibit
5, because Parwani had asked the state to
repeat its prior question in which it had directed
his attention to exhibit 5.

<fnt9> In his reply brief, the defendant acknowledges
that his trial counsel "stumble[d]" by
"struggl[ing] and shift[ing] ground as to the
nature of his objection," but argues that,
nonetheless, the state was "clearly aware"
that it was asking Parwani for his opinion on
an ultimate issue and, thus, should have itself
requested that the court make findings on
whether the jury required an expert's assistance
in deciding that issue. This argument
lacks merit, because it is the responsibility of
the appellant&mdash;not the appellee&mdash;to provide
an adequate record for review. Practice Book
&sect; 61-10 (a); see also <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Feliciano,</EM> 74
Conn. App. 391, 402, 812 A.2d 141 (2002),
cert. denied, 262 Conn. 952, 817 A.2d 110
(2003).

<fnt10> Indeed, it would have been improper for
Parwani to testify as to whether the defendant
had the requisite intent to commit the crimes
with which he was charged. See <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Delgado,</EM>
178 Conn. 448, 449, 423 A.2d 106
(1979) ("intent is a question of fact for the
determination of the trier of fact based upon
the competent evidence presented, and a witness
cannot testify as to the uncommunicated
intent of another person where the trier of
fact is as well qualified as the witness to form
an opinion on the subject"); see also General
Statutes &sect; 54-86i.

<fnt11> As with the defendant's challenge to the
denial of his motion to suppress, we do not
address the question of whether the defendant
was harmed by the admission of Parwani's
testimony in response to the hypothetical because
we conclude that its admission was not
erroneous.

<fnt12> The defendant argues that, because, in his
view, Parwani's testimony on this point was
erroneously admitted, "it should not enter the
calculus when assessing whether the state
produced sufficient evidence as to [the defendant's]
intent." As discussed previously, we
reject the defendant's claim that the trial
court improperly admitted Parwani's testimony
that the screwdriver was capable of causing
serious physical injury. Even if we agreed
with the defendant that Parwani's testimony
was improperly admitted, however, we would
still consider it when evaluating the defendant's
sufficiency of the evidence claim. See,
e.g., <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Morelli,</EM> 293 Conn. 147, 153, 976
A.2d 678 (2009) ("even improperly admitted
evidence may be considered in [evidentiary
sufficiency] analysis, since [c]laims of evidentiary
sufficiency in criminal cases are always
addressed independently of claims of evidentiary
error" (internal quotation marks omitted)).

<fnt13> Recognizing that Folkes' testimony undercuts
his argument, the defendant asks us to
find that Folkes lacked credibility. We cannot
and will not do so. See footnote 5 of this
opinion.

<fnt14> The defendant also argues that his choice
of a screwdriver as a weapon, rather than "a
knife or a gun or similarly dangerous weapon,"
indicates that he did not intend to cause
serious physical injury. But given that there
was sufficient evidence of the screwdriver's
capacity to inflict serious physical injury; see
part III B of this opinion; the jury reasonably
could have determined that the defendant's
choice of this weapon indicated an intent to
cause such an injury to the victim.

<P20>The self-represented defendant, Ryan
Bryan, appeals from the judgment of the
trial court
<SPage 366>
denying his motion to correct
an illegal sentence filed pursuant to Practice
Book &sect; 43-22.<fnr1> The defendant first
claims that the court erred in denying his
motion because his guilty plea to being a
persistent dangerous felony offender pursuant
to General Statutes &sect; 53a-40<fnr2> was
defective or, in the alternative, that the
court should have dismissed his motion for
lack of subject matter jurisdiction, rather
than denying it on the merits.<fnr3> Second, the
<Page 469>
defendant claims, for the first time on
appeal, that the sentencing court improperly
failed to specify which portion of his
sentence was attributable to the enhancement
imposed pursuant to &sect; 53a-40. With
respect to the first claim, we conclude that
the trial court lacked
<SPage 367>
subject matter
jurisdiction over the defendant's claim and,
accordingly, that the court should have
dismissed the motion to correct. We further
conclude that the defendant is not
entitled to review of his unpreserved second
claim. Accordingly, we reverse the
judgment of the trial court and remand
with direction to dismiss the defendant's
motion to correct.

<P20>The following procedural history is relevant
to the defendant's claims. On April 25,
2018, the defendant pleaded guilty to assault
in the first degree in violation of
General Statutes &sect; 53a-59(a)(1), and criminal
possession of a firearm in violation of
General Statutes &sect; 53a-217(a)(1). During
the same plea hearing, the defendant also
pleaded guilty to a part B information
charging him with being a persistent dangerous
felony offender in violation of
&sect; 53a-40(a)(1).<fnr4> As the basis for the
persistent dangerous felony offender
charge, the state alleged that the defendant
previously had been convicted of attempt
to commit assault in the first degree
and that he had been imprisoned for more
than one year for such conviction. On July
18, 2018, the court, <EM>Clifford, J.,</EM> sentenced
the defendant to a term of seventeen years
of incarceration, ten years of which was a
mandatory minimum.

<P20>On July 18, 2022, the defendant filed the
instant motion to correct an illegal sentence.
The court, <EM>Harmon, J.,</EM> held a hearing
on the defendant's motion on May 2,
2023, during which the defendant argued
that he was improperly found to be a
persistent dangerous felony offender because
his guilty plea to the part B information
was procedurally defective.<fnr5> Specifically,
the defendant
<SPage 368>
argued that, because
&sect; 53a-40(a)(1) provides for a sentence
enhancement for a person who "stands
convicted" of an eligible offense after having
been convicted of and imprisoned for a
prior eligible offense; see footnote 2 of this
opinion; the court was required to hold a
separate plea proceeding on the part B
information <EM>after</EM> it had accepted his guilty
plea to the eligible offense with which he
was charged in this case, namely, assault
in the first degree. The defendant further
argued that, because the court did not
follow that procedure, "[it was] impossible
for [him] to be considered to be a persistent
[dangerous felony] offender at [the]
time [he pleaded guilty to the part B information]"
because he was "not yet convicted
of assault [in the first degree]." The defendant
further claimed that the alleged impropriety
in the plea proceedings violated
his right to due process. The court denied
<Page 470>
the defendant's motion on the record. This
appeal followed.

<P20>The following legal principles
and standard of review are applicable to
the defendant's claims. "The determination
of whether a claim may be brought via a
motion to correct an illegal sentence presents
a question of law over which our
review is plenary." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Smith,</EM> 213 Conn.
App. 848, 853, 279 A.3d 303, cert. denied,
345 Conn. 963, 285 A.3d 387 (2022). "A
motion to correct an illegal sentence under
Practice Book &sect; 43-22 constitutes a narrow
exception to the general rule that, once a
defendant's sentence has begun, the authority
of the sentencing court to modify
that sentence terminates." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) Id., at 853-54, 279
A.3d 303. "In order for the court to have
jurisdiction over a motion to correct an
<SPage 369>
illegal sentence after the sentence has
been executed, the sentencing proceeding,
and not the [proceedings] leading to the
conviction, must be the subject of the attack."
(Internal quotation marks omitted.)
<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Casiano,</EM> 122 Conn. App. 61, 68,
998 A.2d 792, cert. denied, 298 Conn. 931, 5
A.3d 491 (2010).

<P20>"Our appellate courts have held that a
trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction
over a motion to correct challenging alleged
flaws in the plea process." <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>King,</EM> 220 Conn. App. 549, 563, 300 A.3d
626, cert. denied, 348 Conn. 918, 303 A.3d
1194 (2023); see id. (court lacked jurisdiction
over motion to correct claiming that
court failed to conduct proper canvass and
make statutorily required findings prior to
accepting plea); see also <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Das,</EM> 291
Conn. 356, 363 n.3, 968 A.2d 367 (2009)
("[t]o the extent that the defendant's
claims are based on alleged flaws in the
court's acceptance of his plea, Practice
Book &sect; 43-22 is clearly inapplicable"); <EM>State</EM>
v. <EM>Boyd,</EM> 204 Conn. App. 446, 456-57, 253
A.3d 988 (court lacked jurisdiction over
motion to correct that was "nothing more
than a collateral attack on the plea underlying
the defendant's conviction rather
than a true challenge to the legality of the
sentence imposed or to the sentencing proceedings"),
cert. denied, 336 Conn. 951, 251
A.3d 617 (2021).

<P20>With respect to the defendant's
claim that his guilty plea to being a persistent
dangerous felony offender was defective,
we conclude that the court lacked
jurisdiction over that claim because it challenges
the validity of the defendant's guilty
plea and the propriety of the plea proceedings,
rather than the sentence or sentencing
proceedings. The defendant argues in
his brief that his "[s]entence is illegal because
[his] plea on the underlying assault
was not separated from the persistent
[dangerous felony] offender enhancement."
He further argues that "[t]o be charged
with the part B information, there has to
be a separate proceeding, then the defendant
<SPage 370>
has to be canvassed for persistent
[dangerous felony] offender enhancement"
and that "the lack of a second canvass
deprived the defendant [of] procedural due
process...." Because the defendant's
claim "is a collateral attack on the plea
process rather than a true challenge to the
legality of his sentence or the manner in
which his sentence was imposed"; <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>King,</EM> supra, 220 Conn. App. at 565, 300
A.3d 626; we conclude that the court
lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the
defendant's motion.

<P20>With respect to the defendant's
unpreserved claim that his sentence lacked
specificity with respect to the portion attributable
to &sect; 53a-40, the defendant seeks
review under <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Golding,</EM> 213 Conn.
233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). This
court, however, has declined to grant <EM>Golding</EM>
review of an unpreserved claim on
appeal from the denial of a motion to
<Page 471>
correct illegal sentence because "[o]ur
rules of practice confer the authority to
correct an illegal sentence on the trial
court, and that court is in a superior position
to fashion an appropriate remedy for
an illegal sentence.... Furthermore, the
defendant has the right, at any time, to file
a motion to correct an illegal sentence and
raise [a] ... claim [challenging the legality
of his sentence] before the trial court. Typically,
our appellate courts afford review
under <EM>Golding</EM> ... in circumstances in
which the failure to undertake such an
extraordinary level of review, effectively,
would preclude an appellant from obtaining
<EM>any</EM> judicial review of the claim raised.
That is not the case here." (Citation omitted;
emphasis in original.) <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Starks,</EM>
121 Conn. App. 581, 592, 997 A.2d 546
(2010); see also <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Heriberto B.,</EM> 207
Conn. App. 192, 209-10, 261 A.3d 838, cert.

Conn. App. 601, 604 n.3, 999 A.2d 848
(2010).
<SPage 371>

<P20>In the present case, the defendant
may obtain review of his claim by filing a
motion to correct in the trial court, which
"is in a superior position to fashion an
appropriate remedy for an illegal sentence."
<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Starks,</EM> supra, 121 Conn.
App. at 592, 997 A.2d 546. Accordingly, we
decline to review the defendant's unpreserved
claim.<fnr6>

<P20>The form of the judgment is improper;
the judgment denying the defendant's motion
to correct an illegal sentence is reversed
and the case is remanded with direction
to render a judgment of dismissal.
<FN>
<fnt1> Practice Book &sect; 43-22 provides: "The judicial
authority may at any time correct an
illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or
it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal
manner or any other disposition made in
an illegal manner."

<fnt2> General Statutes &sect; 53a-40 provides in relevant
part: "(a) A persistent dangerous felony
offender is a person who ... (1) (A) Stands
convicted of ... assault in the first degree ...
and (B) has been, prior to the commission of
the present crime, convicted of and imprisoned
under a sentence to a term of imprisonment
of more than one year or of death, in
this state or in any other state or in a federal
correctional institution, for any of the ...
crimes enumerated in subparagraph (A) of
this subdivision or an attempt to commit any
of said crimes....

<B42>"(i) When any person has been found to be
a persistent dangerous felony offender, the
court, in lieu of imposing the sentence of
imprisonment authorized by the general statutes
for the crime of which such person presently

mandatory minimum term of imprisonment...."

<fnt3> The state argues both that the trial court
lacked jurisdiction over the motion to correct
<EM>and</EM> that this court lacks jurisdiction to review
the defendant's claim on appeal. It is well
established, however, that "[t]he trial court's
lack of subject matter jurisdiction does not
... deprive this court of appellate jurisdiction"
to determine whether the trial court had
jurisdiction. <EM>Finley</EM> v. <EM>Inland Wetlands Commission,</EM>
289 Conn. 12, 31 n.14, 959 A.2d 569
(2008).

<fnt4> We note that, although both parties cite to
the transcripts of the plea and sentencing
proceedings in their briefs, it appears from
the record that such transcripts were not ordered
or filed in accordance with Practice
Book &sect; 63-8. In light of our resolution of the
defendant's claims, we need not address any
issues regarding the adequacy of the record
on appeal.

<fnt5> Prior to the hearing, Attorney Justine Whalen
was appointed as counsel for the defendant
for the limited purpose of determining whether
there was a sound basis for the motion to
correct. See <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Casiano,</EM> 282 Conn. 614,
627, 922 A.2d 1065 (2007). On April 24, 2023,
Whalen filed a motion to withdraw her appearance
on the ground that she had determined
there was no sound basis for the motion
to correct. At the outset of the hearing,
the court granted the motion to withdraw;
thereafter, the defendant elected to proceed in
a self-represented capacity.

<fnt6> As we recognized in <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Heriberto B.,</EM>
supra, 207 Conn. App. 192, 261 A.3d 838,
although our Supreme Court has, in other
circumstances, reviewed unpreserved claims
on appeal from the denial of a motion to
correct; see <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>McCleese,</EM> 333 Conn. 378,
425 n.24, 215 A.3d 1154 (2019); <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Evans,</EM>

overrule <EM>Starks</EM> and, therefore, do not compel
us to review the defendant's claim. See <EM>State</EM>

<P20><author>Shanker</author>, <dgn>Associate Judge</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Rodney Hill Alleyne appeals a single
conviction&mdash;robbery&mdash;out of a series of
convictions stemming from a road rage
incident. After a car crash precipitated by
Mr. Alleyne's aggressive driving, Mr. Alleyne
pulled the other driver&mdash;Henry Steven
Romero-Guardado&mdash;out of his car and
took his wallet from his pants pocket. He
then left the scene without returning it.
The jury found Mr. Alleyne guilty of robbery,
in violation of D.C. Code &sect; 22-2801.
Now on appeal, Mr. Alleyne contends that
the trial court erred by failing to instruct
the jury that (1) he must have intended to
permanently deprive Mr. Romero-Guardado
of his wallet and (2) such intent must
have existed at the moment he took the
wallet. He further argues the government
put forward insufficient evidence that he
intended to steal Mr. Romero-Guardado's
wallet.

<P20>We conclude that reversal is not warranted
on any of Mr. Alleyne's asserted
grounds. First, because robbery's intent
element is satisfied if the defendant takes
the property intending to return it only
upon the satisfaction of a condition (e.g.,
payment of a ransom)&mdash;and the evidence
was sufficient for the jury to find that Mr.
Alleyne possessed that intent&mdash;Mr. Alleyne's
sufficiency argument fails. Second,
under plain-error review, assuming Mr. Alleyne
is correct that he must have intended
to steal the victim's wallet at the time
he took it, the trial court's instructions
sufficiently informed the jury of this "concurrence"
requirement such that Mr. Alleyne
did not suffer harm to his substantial
rights. Finally, again under plain-error review,
Mr. Alleyne has not shown that any
durational error in the trial court's instructions
affected his substantial rights. Accordingly,
we affirm.

<CN><EMB>I. Facts and Procedural History</EMB>

<P20>Because Mr. Alleyne raises both instructional
and sufficiency arguments, we describe
below both the evidence admitted
by the government and select instructional
discussions between the trial court and the
parties.

<CN><EMB>A. The Crash</EMB>

<P20>On a sunny spring day in the District,
Mr. Alleyne stopped his car at a red light
behind complainant Mr. Romero-Guardado.
Once the light turned green, Mr. Alleyne
began to honk his car's horn. He
then swerved into the right lane, nearly
hitting a different vehicle in the process,
and pulled even with Mr. Romero-Guardado.
Once in view, he "began making [angry]
hand gestures" and threw a can at
Mr. Romero-Guardado's vehicle, striking
either a window or the windshield. Then,
after speeding up to pass Mr. Romero-Guardado,
Mr. Alleyne swung back into
the left lane and, although no cars were in
front of him, "slammed" his brakes. At the
time Mr. Alleyne applied his brakes, the
two cars were approximately three feet
apart. Unable to stop, Mr. Romero-Guardado
hit Mr. Alleyne's car.

<CN><EMB>B. The Confrontation</EMB>

<P20>Mr. Alleyne exited his vehicle already
upset, indeed, "screaming." After approaching
Mr. Romero-Guardado's vehicle
with, in the words of an onlooking bus
driver, "a very aggressive type body language,"
he "lean[ed] into" Mr. Romero-Guardado's
vehicle, still screaming, and
jerked Mr. Romero-Guardado's arm to
"g[e]t [Mr. Romero-Guardado] out of [his]
car." He then got "in [Mr. Romero-Guardado's]
face" and yelled that Mr. Romero-Guardado
<Page 477>
"need[ed] to pay for this." Next,
Mr. Alleyne "search[ed]" Mr. Romero-Guardado's
pants pockets, removed Mr.
Romero-Guardado's wallet, and "tussled"
with Mr. Romero-Guardado while securing
it. As part of this struggle, Mr. Alleyne
tried to take Mr. Romero-Guardado's cell
phone, but Mr. Romero-Guardado put it in
his underwear. With the wallet in hand,
Mr. Alleyne returned to his car and placed
it inside. Prior to taking Mr. Romero-Guardado's
wallet, Mr. Alleyne never
asked for Mr. Romero-Guardado's contact
information.

<P20>Mr. Alleyne then approached Mr. Romero-Guardado's
car anew and began searching
through it, opening the front and back
doors. Finding a jacket and a mechanic's
wrench, he took both from the car. He
placed the jacket in his own vehicle alongside
Mr. Romero-Guardado's wallet but
kept the wrench in his hand. All the while,
he continued yelling that Mr. Romero-Guardado
was "going to have to pay for
this."

<P20>During this confrontation, Mr. Romero-Guardado
looked afraid and attempted to
back away. He felt "very nervous," like he
"was going to cry." Concerned that Mr.
Alleyne would take all of his remaining
items and his car, Mr. Romero-Guardado
gave his cell phone to a man who had
pulled over to assist and handed his insurance
information and car registration to
the onlooking bus driver.<fnr1> Mr. Romero-Guardado
also asked both men to call the
police, and at least one did.

<P20>In the background of this 9-1-1 call, one
can hear Mr. Alleyne asking Mr. Romero-Guardado,
"What's your name? Where's
your phone at?" In addition to these questions,
Mr. Alleyne asked Mr. Romero-Guardado
to call his insurance company.
And Mr. Alleyne would eventually use a
phone belonging to Mr. Romero-Guardado's
coworker to call the insurance company.
The call, for reasons left unclear at
trial, was unsuccessful.

<P20>At some point, the bus driver called Mr.
Alleyne over to the bus in an attempt to
calm him down. Mr. Alleyne explained to
the driver that "a Latino [person had previously
hit his vehicle] and he didn't get
the vehicle fixed or get any compensation."
He went on to say that he "was definitely
going to get something today." But Mr.
Alleyne cut the conversation short when,
according to the bus driver, Mr. Alleyne
looked up and noticed the bus's camera.

<P20>Throughout this confrontation, Mr.
Romero-Guardado repeatedly asked for his
possessions back, but Mr. Alleyne declined
each time. Instead, Mr. Alleyne indicated
that he would give Mr. Romero-Guardado
his wallet back if Mr. Romero-Guardado
followed him somewhere else. Mr. Alleyne
then drove to a nearby gas station, and
Mr. Romero-Guardado met him there. Mr.
Romero-Guardado repeated his request for
his wallet, but Mr. Alleyne again said, "No,
follow me. Not here." Mr. Romero-Guardado,
fearing for his safety, declined to follow
Mr. Alleyne and instead returned to the
scene of the crash, where he provided Mr.
Alleyne's license plate number to police
officers.

<CN><EMB>C. The Interview</EMB>

<P20>Several weeks later, police officers interviewed
Mr. Alleyne. In the interview, Mr.
Alleyne claimed that he told Mr. Romero-Guardado
he needed Mr. Romero-Guardado's
wallet to be able to contact Mr. Romero-Guardado's
insurance company, but Mr.
Romero-Guardado did not seem to understand.
<Page 478>
Mr. Alleyne next asserted that he
asked Mr. Romero-Guardado if Mr. Romero-Guardado
could pay for the damage, but
Mr. Romero-Guardado said he had no
money. Then, Mr. Alleyne explained that
he saw Mr. Romero-Guardado's jacket, but
he did not explain why he took it. Mr.
Alleyne told the interviewing officer that
he left the scene to avoid holding up traffic.

<P20>Mr. Alleyne went on to admit that he
had Mr. Romero-Guardado's wallet and
work jacket with him when he left the
accident scene. He reiterated his claim
that he took the wallet to get in touch with
Mr. Romero-Guardado but did not explain
how the wallet (or the work jacket and
wrench) would help him to do so (but he
asserted that he took Mr. Romero-Guardado's
wrench due to a fear that Mr. Romero-Guardado
or his passenger would hit
him with it). Finally, he stated that he
threw the wallet away after learning that
he could not contact Mr. Romero-Guardado
and that Mr. Romero-Guardado "had no
money."

<CN><EMB>D. The Trial</EMB>

<P20>A grand jury indicted Mr. Alleyne for
robbery, assault, unlawful entry of a motor
vehicle, second-degree theft, and leaving
after colliding. The case proceeded to a
jury trial.

<P20>A central issue on appeal involves the
trial court's instructions regarding intent.
The trial court and the parties discussed a
proposed set of jury instructions prior to
closing statements. During this discussion,
Mr. Alleyne asked the court to deliver to
the jury a lesser-included theft instruction
in addition to a robbery instruction. The
trial court initially agreed to give the lesser-included
theft instruction, but later
asked, "How could a jury rationally find
... that there could be a theft and not a
robbery here?" Mr. Alleyne responded
that the key difference involved the two
offenses' intent elements. Unlike robbery,
according to Mr. Alleyne, theft can occur
where a defendant "use[s] or deal[s] with
the property in such a way as to make it
unlikely that the owner will recover it." So,
Mr. Alleyne's counsel stated, "the theft
could occur when the wallet was not returned
because Mr. Alleyne said he threw
the wallet away."

<P20>The trial court suggested that there is
"no distinction in the case law between the
deprivation of property elements of the
robbery and theft statutes." So, said the
trial court, "I don't understand how the
jury could rationally conclude that there
was a theft and not a robbery." Put differently,
the trial court felt that if the jury
were to find that Mr. Alleyne took the
property intending to return it, Mr. Alleyne
might well be not guilty of both
offenses.

<P20>In response, Mr. Alleyne's counsel stated
that if the trial court was set on not
providing the lesser-included theft instruction,
he would "ask that the specific intent
language be added to the robbery [instruction]."
"Right now," said defense counsel,
"it just says intending to take it." In saying
"it," defense counsel appeared to be
referencing the last line in the standard
jury instructions regarding the requisite
intent for robbery: "It is necessary that
[<EMU>name of defendant</EMU>] intended to deprive
[<EMU>name of complainant</EMU>] of his/her property
and to take it for his/her own use." Criminal
Jury Instructions for the District of
Columbia, No. 4.300 (5th ed. 2024). Defense
counsel asked to replace the "intended
to deprive" language with "took the
property without right with specific intent
to steal it."

<P20>The trial court replied that the standard
robbery instruction already contained language
similar to that requested by Mr.
Alleyne. <EM>See</EM> Criminal Jury Instructions for
<Page 479>
the District of Columbia, No. 4.300 (5th ed.
2024) ("The government must establish
that [<EMU>name of defendant</EMU>] had no right to
take the property, and that s/he intended
to steal it. There can be no robbery if the
defendant takes the property for a lawful
purpose."). The trial court thus declined to
make Mr. Alleyne's requested modification,
and Mr. Alleyne did not press the
issue anew when the trial court asked if
there was "[a]nything further[?]"

<P20>After a break, the trial court indicated
that it had revisited this court's precedent
on lesser-included theft instructions and
now agreed with defense counsel that robbery
and theft have different mens rea
requirements. The trial court explained its
understanding that robbery requires "an
intent to permanently deprive a person of
property," whereas theft requires "merely
[the] intent to appropriate the property
inconsistent with the owner's right." The
trial court believed the jury could find that
Mr. Alleyne possessed the latter intent but
not the former; therefore, it agreed to give
the lesser-included theft instruction. Mr.
Alleyne did not raise any other issues regarding
the robbery or theft instructions,
and the trial court gave the pattern instructions
for both offenses to the jury.

<P20>As pertinent here, the jury convicted
Mr. Alleyne of one count of robbery under
D.C. Code &sect; 22-2801.

<CN><EMB>II. Analysis</EMB>

<P20>We begin with Mr. Alleyne's sufficiency
argument, then address his contention regarding
a "concurrence" requirement, and
finally turn to whether the instructions
created a risk that the jury would convict
Mr. Alleyne even if they believed he intended
to deprive Mr. Romero-Guardado
of the wallet only temporarily and unconditionally.
Where relevant, we will also discuss
whether Mr. Alleyne preserved his
claims on appeal, and if not, whether those
claims survive plain-error review.

<CN><EMB>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</EMB>

<P20>We review a claim of insufficient
evidence de novo, considering "all the evidence
in the light most favorable to the
verdict [and] according deference to the
factfinder to weigh the evidence, determine
credibility, and draw justifiable inferences
of fact." <EM>Wicks v. United States,</EM> 226
A.3d 743, 746-47 (D.C. 2020) (internal quotation
marks omitted). We affirm if "any
rational trier of fact could have found the
essential elements of the crime beyond a
reasonable doubt." <EM>Rivas v. United States,</EM>
783 A.2d 125, 134 (D.C. 2001) (en banc)
(internal quotation marks and emphasis
omitted).

<P20>To apply the above standard, we must
first identify the elements of robbery. This
crime is codified in D.C. Code &sect; 22-2801,
which provides, in relevant part:

<B22>Whoever by force or violence, whether
against resistance or by sudden or stealthy
seizure or snatching, or by putting
in fear, shall take from the person or
immediate actual possession of another
anything of value, is guilty of robbery,
and any person convicted thereof shall
suffer imprisonment for not less than 2
years nor more than 15 years.

<P20>We do not rely on the above
statute alone for robbery's elements. Instead,
because robbery in this jurisdiction
"retains its common law elements," we
turn to case law. <EM>Lattimore v. United
States,</EM> 684 A.2d 357, 359 (D.C. 1996). At
common law, robbery is a composite
crime&mdash;it incorporates the elements of
both larceny and assault. <EM>Id.</EM> Accordingly,
to secure a conviction for robbery by force
or fear, the government must prove that
there was "(1) a felonious taking, (2) accompanied
by an asportation [or carrying
away], of (3) personal property of value, (4)
<Page 480>
from the person of another or in his presence,
(5) against his will, (6) by violence or
by putting him in fear, [and] (7) animo
furandi [the intention to steal]." <EM>Id.</EM> (second
alteration added and internal quotation
marks omitted).

<P20>Mr. Alleyne argues that the government's
evidence was insufficient to establish
the mens rea element for larceny and
thus robbery, that is, the intent, or purpose,
to steal. To resolve his contention, we
first clarify our law regarding robbery's
mens rea requirement. We then assess the
evidence with this clarified requirement in
mind. Ultimately, we conclude that a reasonable
jury could have found that Mr.
Alleyne possessed the state of mind necessary
to commit robbery at the time he took
Mr. Romero-Guardado's wallet.

<CN><EMB>1. Purpose to permanently or
conditionally deprive</EMB>

<P20>To resolve whether the evidence of Mr.
Alleyne's state of mind at trial was sufficient,
we must first address what mens rea
robbery requires. The parties derive from
this court's precedent two&mdash;in their view,
conflicting&mdash;definitions of "intent to steal."
We have said in some cases that to commit
larceny, a person must possess "the intent
to permanently deprive the rightful owner
[of property]." <EM>Lattimore,</EM> 684 A.2d at 360
(internal quotation marks omitted); <EM>see
also Corbin v. United States,</EM> 120 A.3d 588,
591 n.3 (D.C. 2015); <EM>Durphy v. United
States,</EM> 235 A.2d 326, 327 (D.C. 1967). But
other cases have criticized this definition.
In <EM>Pennsylvania Indemnity Fire Corp. v.
Aldridge,</EM> for instance, the court recognized
that the common-law crime of larceny
requires "specific intent permanently to
deprive the owner of his property," but it
went on to note that "the old common-law
definition of larceny has been largely modified
... by the courts which purport still
to apply the common law." 117 F.2d 774,
775-78 & n.8 (D.C. Cir. 1941) (citing,
among other cases, an out-of-jurisdiction
precedent holding that "theft of goods with
intent to sell them back to the owner"
qualifies as larceny).<fnr2> And in <EM>Mitchell v.
United States,</EM> the court cited the above
language in <EM>Aldridge</EM> to "reject appellants'
contention that larceny requires an intent
to appropriate property permanently." 394
F.2d 767, 771 (D.C. Cir. 1968).<fnr3>

<P20>Given the language in the above cases,
we do not fault the parties for presenting
us with what they view as a binary choice
between two distinct intent standards. We,
however, do not read our precedent in this
manner. In our view, <EM>Aldridge</EM> and <EM>Mitchell</EM>
did not approve a departure from the
common law but instead recognized a conclusion
reached by other courts through
the iterative process of common-law reasoning:
that "permanently deprive" should
not be taken literally. <EM>Cf. Manoukian v.
Tomasian,</EM> 237 F.2d 211, 215 (D.C. Cir.
1956) ("It has been said so often as to have
become axiomatic that the common law is
not immutable but flexible, and by its own
principles adapts itself to varying conditions."
(quoting <EM>Funk v. United States,</EM> 290
U.S. 371, 383, 54 S.Ct. 212, 78 L.Ed. 369
(1933))); <EM>Fleming v. United States,</EM> 224
A.3d 213, 228 (D.C. 2020) (en banc) ("This
<Page 481>
court ... has repeatedly rejected the view
that the common law of the District of
Columbia was `frozen' in 1901."). Indeed,
the Supreme Court of California&mdash;the
highest court in another jurisdiction that
elaborates on the elements of its robbery
statute through common-law reasoning&mdash;
has reached a similar conclusion to that
articulated in <EM>Mitchell</EM> and <EM>Aldridge. See
People v. Davis,</EM> 19 Cal.4th 301, 79 Cal.
Rptr.2d 295, 965 P.2d 1165, 1169, 1173
(1998) ("[T]he general rule is not inflexible:
[t]he word `permanently' ... is not to be
taken literally." (internal quotation marks
omitted)).

<P20>We need not identify all possible
situations in which a person who takes
property will satisfy robbery's mens rea
requirement. Instead, we hold only that, in
addition to situations where a person's
purpose to permanently deprive (in its literal
sense) is clear, a person possesses the
mens rea necessary to commit common-law
larceny&mdash;and through it, robbery&mdash;
when they take property with the purpose
to return it only upon the satisfaction of a
"condition [they] ha[ve] no right to impose."
<EM>E.g., Carter v. Commonwealth,</EM> 280
Va. 100, 694 S.E.2d 590, 595 (2010) (citing
3 Wayne R. LaFave, <EM>Substantive Criminal
Law</EM> &sect; 19.5(b) (2d ed. 2003)).

<P20>This understanding of common-law larceny's
mens rea requirement has been embraced
by sister jurisdictions and scholars
alike. The highest courts in California, Virginia,
New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio, and
Massachusetts have adopted it.<fnr4> Noted
commentators Wayne R. LaFave and Jens
David Ohlin have endorsed it in their respective
treatises. 3 Wayne R. LaFave,
<EM>Substantive Criminal Law</EM> &sect; 19.5(b) (3d
ed. Oct. 2024 update) ("[I]t is no defense to
larceny that the taker intended to return
[taken property] only if he should receive a
reward for its return, or only upon some
other condition which he has no right to
impose." (footnote omitted)); 2 Jens David
Ohlin, <EM>Wharton's Criminal Law</EM> &sect; 31:2
(16th ed. Aug. 2024 update) ("An intent to
return that is conditional, such as a ransom,
is not a defense."). And we ourselves
have adopted this understanding when interpreting
our jurisdiction's theft offense.
<EM>See Price v. United States,</EM> 985 A.2d 434,
437 (D.C. 2009) (citing, among other cases,
<EM>Davis,</EM> 79 Cal.Rptr.2d 295, 965 P.2d at
1175) (concluding that taking an item from
a display shelf with the intent to return it
for a refund satisfies theft's intent requirement).
We now adopt this interpretation in
the robbery context: where a person takes
property with the intent to return it only
upon the satisfaction of a condition they
have no right to impose, that person possesses
the requisite mens rea for robbery.<fnr5>
<Page 482>

<CN><EMB>2. Application</EMB>

<P20>We now turn to whether the evidence
of intent put forth by the government
was sufficient. For purposes of this
analysis, we assume without deciding that,
as Mr. Alleyne contends, the government
was required to show that he intended to
steal Mr. Romero-Guardado's wallet at the
moment he took it.<fnr6> Because Mr. Alleyne's
behavior throughout his interactions with
Mr. Romero-Guardado supports the conclusion
that he took Mr. Romero-Guardado's
wallet with the intent to hold it effectively
for ransom, Mr. Alleyne's sufficiency
argument fails.

<P20>We begin with Mr. Alleyne's contemporaneous,
incriminating statements. From
the beginning of the incident, Mr. Alleyne
yelled that Mr. Romero-Guardado "needed
to pay." Mr. Alleyne then told an onlooking
bus driver that he "was definitely going
to get something <EM>today.</EM>" A reasonable
factfinder could interpret these statements
to suggest that Mr. Alleyne wanted payment
immediately and took the wallet to
ensure he would get it.

<P20>Next, Mr. Alleyne engaged in conduct
inconsistent with his stated explanation for
his actions&mdash;that he wanted to make sure
he had Mr. Romero-Guardado's contact information.
He wrested Mr. Romero-Guardado's
wallet from his pocket without first
asking for Mr. Romero-Guardado's information.
He then took two of Mr. Romero-Guardado's
possessions&mdash;a jacket and a
wrench&mdash;that had no relevance to contact
information. Even after seeing Mr. Romero-Guardado's
insurance information and
calling the number listed, he declined to
return Mr. Romero-Guardado's possessions.
Instead, Mr. Alleyne said that he
"threw [the wallet] away" after realizing
that Mr. Romero-Guardado "ha[d] no money"
and that he "couldn't get in contact
with [Mr. Romero-Guardado]."

<P20>Finally, viewing the evidence in the light
most favorable to the verdict, a jury could
interpret Mr. Alleyne's efforts to leave the
scene as suggesting that he wanted to get
Mr. Romero-Guardado away from onlookers
to extract a payment of some kind. The
bus driver implied that Mr. Alleyne drove
away from the scene after realizing a camera
on the bus was recording him. Once
Mr. Romero-Guardado caught up with Mr.
Alleyne at a gas station near the accident,
Mr. Alleyne yet again refused to return
the wallet unless Mr. Romero-Guardado
followed him to yet another, unknown location.
If Mr. Alleyne left the scene to, as he
claimed, get out of the way of traffic, why
then was he unwilling to exchange contact
information once he and Mr. Romero-Guardado
were safely at the gas station?
The jury could reasonably have answered
that question as follows: Mr. Alleyne left
<Page 483>
the scene so that he could extract a ransom
from Mr. Romero-Guardado away
from the public's gaze.

<P20>Based on the above evidence, a jury
could find beyond a reasonable doubt that
Mr. Alleyne took the wallet intending to
return it only if Mr. Romero-Guardado
compensated him for the damage to his
car. And if Mr. Alleyne so intended, he
possessed the requisite mental state for
robbery. The government's evidence of
Mr. Alleyne's intent was accordingly sufficient
to sustain his conviction.

<CN><EMB>B. Concurrence of Intent and Taking</EMB>

<P20>Mr. Alleyne's concurrence argument targets
the trial court's jury instructions&mdash;he
contends that the court should have told
the jury that Mr. Alleyne must have intended
to steal the wallet at the moment
he took it from Mr. Romero-Guardado. We
hold that, under plain-error review, the
failure of the court to give the jury an
instruction further emphasizing the concurrence
requirement did not create a reasonable
probability of a different outcome.
We therefore find no reversible error.

<CN><EMB>1. Standard of review</EMB>

<P20>We normally "review de novo
whether challenged jury instructions adequately
state the law." <EM>Fleming,</EM> 224 A.3d
at 219.<fnr7> An instruction is accurate if it
"clearly explain[s]" the applicable law. <EM>See
Dawkins v. United States,</EM> 189 A.3d 223,
237 (D.C. 2018).

<P20>We apply plain-error review to
unpreserved claims of instructional error.
<EM>See Allen v. United States,</EM> 495 A.2d 1145,
1151 n.11 (D.C. 1985) (en banc). The government
urges us to apply plain-error review
to Mr. Alleyne's concurrence argument
on the ground that Mr. Alleyne did
not raise the concurrence issue at trial.
After reviewing the record, we agree that
Mr. Alleyne failed to preserve this issue in
the trial court.

<P20>To preserve an argument of
instructional error for appeal, a party must
bring that argument to the trial court's
attention. Super. Ct. Crim. R. 30; <EM>Green v.
United States,</EM> 718 A.2d 1042, 1056 (D.C.
1998). A general objection does not suffice;
the objection "must be specific enough to
direct the judge's attention to the correct
rule of law" and "be made with sufficient
precision to indicate distinctly the party's
thesis." <EM>Russell v. United States,</EM> 698 A.2d
1007, 1012 (D.C. 1997); <EM>see also Ebron v.
United States,</EM> 838 A.2d 1140, 1147 (D.C.
2003) (noting that "the purpose behind the
contemporaneous objection rule" is for a
party to "put the court on notice of the
objection, the reason for it, and the relief
sought"). This clarity requirement, moreover,
extends to a proposed replacement
instruction. <EM>See Zeledon v. United States,</EM>
770 A.2d 972, 976 (D.C. 2001) (noting that
there are "certainly limits to the judge's
duty to `get it right' despite a mistaken
proffer by the defense of what an instruction
should be"). Ultimately, an objection
must "fairly apprise[]" the trial court of
the party's position and the correct legal
principle. <EM>Evans v. United States,</EM> 304 A.3d
211, 219, 222 (D.C. 2023).

<P20>Mr. Alleyne never asked the trial court
to specify to the jury at what time Mr.
<Page 484>
Alleyne's intention to steal needed to
arise.<fnr8> Nor did Mr. Alleyne's trial counsel
make other objections that should have
brought the issue to the trial judge's attention.
So, Mr. Alleyne forfeited this argument.

<P20>The plain-error test imposes a
"formidable" burden on appellants who advance
unpreserved claims. <EM>Hunter v. United
States,</EM> 606 A.2d 139, 144 (D.C. 1992).
Our review has four prongs. An appellant
must show that (1) the trial court erred;
(2) the error was "obvious or readily apparent,
and clear under current law"; (3)
the error affected their substantial rights;
and (4) "either a miscarriage of justice,
that is, actual innocence; or that the trial
court's error seriously affect[ed] the fairness,
integrity or public reputation of judicial
proceedings." <EM>Griffin v. United States,</EM>
144 A.3d 34, 37 (D.C. 2016) (internal quotation
marks omitted and alteration in original).
Because we reverse a conviction
"[o]nly if all four prongs are met," we need
only hold that Mr. Alleyne failed to satisfy
one to dispense with his argument. <EM>Id.</EM>

<CN><EMB>2. Discussion</EMB>

<P20>We assume without suggesting
that there was error and it was clear, and
affirm the trial court pursuant to prong
three: effect on substantial rights. Under
this prong, we affirm unless the defendant
shows a "reasonable probability of a different
outcome but for the established error."
<EM>Keerikkattil v. United States,</EM> 313 A.3d
591, 605 (D.C. 2024) (internal quotation
marks omitted). We conclude that the failure
of the court to give a jury instruction
further emphasizing the concurrence requirement
did not create a reasonable
probability
of a different outcome. This is
true for two reasons: (1) the instructions
as provided already communicated&mdash;at
least, to a degree&mdash;the requirement of concurrence
and (2) the record reveals strong
evidence that Mr. Alleyne possessed the
required mental state at the time he took
Mr. Romero-Guardado's wallet.

<P20>Again assuming that concurrence is required,
the trial court's charge to the jury
referenced just such a requirement. The
trial court told the jury that "the [g]overnment
must prove beyond a reasonable
doubt ... that ... [Mr. Alleyne] took the
property without right to it and intending
to steal it." The natural reading of this
instruction requires concurrence: the adverbial
participle "intending" expresses the
condition of the taker (Mr. Alleyne) in the
moment of the taking.

<P20>To see this point clearly, one need only
remove the intervening phrase "without
right to it." The instruction would then
read: "the government must prove beyond
a reasonable doubt that Mr. Alleyne took
the property intending to steal it." We are
hard-pressed to assign to this instruction
any meaning but the following: "when Mr.
Alleyne took the property, he must have
intended to steal it." And that is the concurrence
requirement for which Mr. Alleyne
advocates. The trial court, therefore,
did not omit mention of the concurrence
requirement from its charge to the jury.

<P20>Mr. Alleyne, when confronted with this
language at oral argument, suggested that
the trial court should have given still
greater emphasis to the concurrence requirement.
But after reviewing the evidence
presented at trial, we are unpersuaded
that greater emphasis would have
made any difference. As discussed in our
<Page 485>
sufficiency analysis, the evidence that Mr.
Alleyne in fact intended to conditionally
deprive Mr. Romero-Guardado of the wallet
at the time he took it was strong. <EM>See
supra</EM> Section II.A.2. And where evidence
related to the challenged element of an
offense was "strong," we have declined to
find plain error. <EM>See, e.g., Hall v. United
States,</EM> 383 A.2d 1086, 1090 (D.C. 1978).
We do so again here.

<CN><EMB>C. Duration of Deprivation</EMB>

<P20>One claim of instructional error remains.
According to Mr. Alleyne, the trial court
erred by failing "to modify the [pattern]
instruction to explain th[at] intent to steal
meant the intent to permanently deprive."
Mr. Alleyne suggests that the instructions'
ambiguity in this regard was heightened
by their use of the phrase "to steal,"
which, in his view, would allow a jury to
convict so long as it found that he took the
wallet without permission, even if he only
intended to keep the wallet temporarily.
We again conclude that Mr. Alleyne did
not preserve this argument in the trial
court. And, under plain-error review, Mr.
Alleyne again cannot show that any error
in this regard affected his substantial
rights. So, reversal is not warranted.

<CN><EMB>1. Standard of review</EMB>

<P20>Mr. Alleyne did not fairly apprise
the trial court of the argument he now
advances. To be sure, he asked for "the
specific intent language [to] be added to
the robbery [instructions].... Right now
it just says intending to take it."<fnr9> But the
meaning of the phrase "specific intent" is
widely regarded as ambiguous. <EM>See</EM> Criminal
Jury Instructions for the District of
Columbia, No. 3.100 (5th ed. 2024) (describing
how its drafters "generally
chose[] to avoid" references to "specific
intent," deeming the phrase "more confusing
than helpful to juries"); <EM>see also Carrell
v. United States,</EM> 165 A.3d 314, 323-24
(D.C. 2017) (en banc) (noting that we have
"previously expressed concern about the
use of `general' and `specific' intent," as we
prefer "more precise gradations of mens
rea"). And nowhere did Mr. Alleyne explain
that he understood "specific intent to
steal" to incorporate "a specific intent to
deprive permanently."<fnr10> Instead, when the
trial court informed Mr. Alleyne that the
instructions already stated that Mr. Alleyne
must have "intended to steal" property,
Mr. Alleyne raised no further objection.
Accordingly, Mr. Alleyne forfeited his
final argument, and we review for plain
error.<fnr11>

<CN><EMB>2. Discussion</EMB>

<P20>We assume without suggesting
that there was error and it was clear, and
<Page 486>
affirm the trial court based on the absence
of a likelihood that that error affected the
jury's verdict. Mr. Alleyne has not shown
an effect on his substantial rights for two
reasons. First, the trial court's instructions,
when read as a whole, arguably communicated
the very instruction Mr. Alleyne
now contends was omitted: intent to temporarily
deprive is not sufficient. Second,
because of the strength of the evidence
suggesting that Mr. Alleyne in fact intended
to hold Mr. Romero-Guardado's wallet
for ransom, we are unpersuaded that a
more specific instruction would have created
a reasonable probability of a different
outcome.

<P20>Our first conclusion rests on a comparison
of the mens rea requirements&mdash;as
stated in the District of Columbia's pattern
criminal jury instructions&mdash;of two charged
offenses: theft and robbery. We feel comfortable
relying in part on this comparison
again for two reasons: one legal and one
grounded in the specific instructions delivered
in this case.

<P20>First, the legal justification.
Our precedent makes clear that we do not
analyze jury instructions in isolation but
instead consider "the instructions in their
entirety." <EM>Buskey v. United States,</EM> 148
A.3d 1193, 1205-06 (D.C. 2016) (internal
quotation marks omitted); <EM>see also Carter
v. United States,</EM> 475 A.2d 1118, 1125 (D.C.
1984). Indeed, courts assess an allegedly
erroneous instruction not only in the context
of the instructions, but also with respect
to the trial record as a whole. <EM>See
Waddington v. Sarausad,</EM> 555 U.S. 179,
191, 129 S.Ct. 823, 172 L.Ed.2d 532 (2009).
And when engaging in this analysis, we
have concluded that a jury confronted with
an allegedly erroneous instruction would
have reached the correct interpretation
based on a further instruction that, although
located in a separate portion of the
trial court's charge, was nevertheless
clearly connected to the challenged instruction.
<EM>See Buskey,</EM> 148 A.3d at 1208
(noting that, although the "trial court's
supplemental instruction was limited to the
question posed about armed robbery," it
"implicitly informed the jury that the same
legal principle applicable to robbery while
armed also applied to burglary while
armed and kidnapping while armed").

<P20>To be sure, the determination as to
whether a jury would forge a logical connection
between separate but related instructions
is highly fact-specific. That
brings us to our second justification: the
nature of the instructions given in this
case. From the beginning of the offense-specific
instructions, the trial court informed
the jury that robbery and theft
were related; it said that it was "going to
instruct [them] on [robbery] and also on
the lesser included offense of second degree
theft."<fnr12> It emphasized the connection
between theft and robbery by instructing
the jury to consider theft of the wallet only
if they found Mr. Alleyne not guilty of
robbery of the wallet.<fnr13> This connection
was underscored still further by the high
degree of similarity between the elements
of theft and robbery as communicated by
the trial court. Finally, second-degree
theft&mdash;unlike the other crimes the jury
was asked to consider&mdash;was not identified
by the trial court as a separate count but
instead subsumed within count one (robbery).
Viewed together, the above considerations
persuade us that the jury&mdash;even if
it did not understand the precise definition
<Page 487>
of "lesser-included offense"&mdash;would have
read the robbery instructions in light of
those delivered with respect to second-degree
theft.

<P20>We now turn to a comparison of
the trial court's theft and robbery instructions.
The trial court delivered pattern
robbery and theft instructions to the jury
back to back.<fnr14> The intent-related robbery
instructions read to the jury informed
them that, to convict Mr. Alleyne of robbery,
"[i]t [was] necessary that Mr. Alleyne
intended to deprive Mr. Romero-Guardado
of his property and to take it for
his own use." It is true that the robbery
instructions did not define "intent to deprive."
But the trial court instructed the
jury immediately thereafter regarding
"[t]he lesser included offense of second
degree theft," which could also be proven
by showing an "inten[t] ... to deprive."<fnr15>
And this time, the trial court offered a
more specific definition:

<B22>To intend to deprive another of property
means to intend to withhold the property
or cause it to be withheld from a
person permanently or for such an extended
period or under such circumstances
that the Defendant acquires a
substantial portion of the property value.
It may also mean to dispose of the
property or to use or deal with the
property in such a way as to make it
unlikely that the owner will recover it.

<P20>Looking at the instructions as a whole,
we conclude the jury was adequately informed
of the definition of "intent to deprive"
for purposes of evaluating whether
Mr. Alleyne was guilty of robbery. This
conclusion follows from the above-discussed
close relationship between the theft
and robbery offenses, their physical and
temporal juxtaposition in the written and
oral instructions, and the fact that the
instructions for both offenses expressly
referenced an intent to deprive. We see
little likelihood that the jury would have
concluded that robbery, despite being a
more serious charge than theft, incorporated
a less-demanding definition of "intent to
deprive."

<P20>Why is this conclusion important? The
trial court's specific definition of "intent to
deprive" communicated exactly that which
Mr. Alleyne contends was omitted&mdash;one
who intends only to temporarily deprive
someone of property cannot be found
guilty of robbery. Under the relevant instruction,
to intend to deprive someone of
property, a defendant must intend to withhold
it either "permanently," "for such an
extended period ... that the Defendant
acquires a substantial portion of the property
value," or in such a way that the
owner is unlikely to ever recover it. Implicit
within these three alternatives is the
concept of long-term&mdash;one might say "permanent"
&mdash;deprivation. If, as our above
analysis indicates, the jury heard the message
Mr. Alleyne wanted them to hear and
still convicted him, we are hard-pressed to
find harm to Mr. Alleyne's substantial
rights.
<Page 488>

<P20>We note also that the evidence presented
in this case strongly suggests that Mr.
Alleyne possessed the intent to hold Mr.
Romero-Guardado's wallet for ransom, i.e.,
to deprive Mr. Romero-Guardado conditionally.
<EM>See supra</EM> Section II.A.2. Moreover,
the government encouraged the jury
to convict not on a theory of temporary
deprivation, but instead on a theory of
permanent or conditional deprivation; during
closing arguments, the government
stated that Mr. Alleyne either "took [the
wallet] to use whatever money was inside
the wallet or he took it to try and get [Mr.
Romero-Guardado] to follow him to extract
some kind of payment out of him off
scene." <EM>See Cupp v. Naughten,</EM> 414 U.S.
141, 146-47, 94 S.Ct. 396, 38 L.Ed.2d 368
(1973) (noting that claims of instructional
error must be assessed in the context of,
among other things, the "argument[s] of
counsel"). Here, our above analysis of the
instructions, the strength of the evidence
of the requisite intent, and the context in
which the government presented that evidence
together convince us that no plain
error occurred. Accordingly, we decline to
reverse Mr. Alleyne's conviction based on
his final claim of instructional error.

<CN><EMB>III. Conclusion</EMB>

<P20>We find sufficient evidence to convict
Mr. Alleyne of robbery, no plain instructional
error with respect to concurrence,
and no plain error in the instructions that
defined the duration for which Mr. Alleyne
must have intended to deprive Mr. Romero-Guardado
of his wallet. We therefore
affirm Mr. Alleyne's conviction.

<P20><EM>So ordered.</EM>
<FN>
<fnt1> Mr. Alleyne, shouting expletives, later approached
the bus and grabbed the documents
Mr. Romero-Guardado had placed therein.

<fnt2> Cases decided by the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,
and its predecessors, before February 1, 1971,
are part of this court's case law. <EM>M.A.P. v.
Ryan,</EM> 285 A.2d 310, 312 (D.C. 1971).

<fnt3> Mr. Alleyne seeks to distinguish <EM>Mitchell</EM>
and similar cases by arguing that, although
those cases recognized that "intent to permanently
deprive" need not be interpreted literally,
they did so only when interpreting a
since-repealed larceny statute. This argument,
however, withers in the face of <EM>Aldridge. See</EM>
117 F.2d at 775 (recognizing non-literal interpretations
of intent to permanently deprive in
the context of the "common-law crime of
larceny").

<fnt4> <EM>See, e.g., Davis,</EM> 79 Cal.Rptr.2d 295, 965
P.2d at 1166-67, 1176 (defendant took property
from store intending to return it for refund;
larceny conviction affirmed); <EM>Carter,</EM> 694
S.E.2d at 592, 594-95 (same); <EM>State v. Hauptmann,</EM>
115 N.J.L. 412, 180 A. 809, 819-20
(1935) (defendant took child's pajamas intending
to return them as part of ransom
demand, larceny conviction affirmed);
<EM>Slaughter v. State,</EM> 113 Ga. 284, 38 S.E. 854,
855-56 (1901) (defendant took jewelry intending
to return it for reward; larceny conviction
affirmed); <EM>Berry v. State,</EM> 31 Ohio St. 219, 219,
226-27 (1877) (same but with horses); <EM>Commonwealth
v. Mason,</EM> 105 Mass. 163, 166-67
(1870) (same as <EM>Berry</EM>). Michigan's intermediate
appellate courts have followed these other
courts' example. <EM>See People v. Harverson,</EM> 291
Mich.App. 171, 804 N.W.2d 757, 762 (2010);
<EM>People v. Jones,</EM> 98 Mich.App. 421, 296
N.W.2d 268, 271 (1980).

<fnt5> Courts have offered numerous rationales to
support interpreting robbery's intent element
in this manner. <EM>See Davis,</EM> 79 Cal.Rptr.2d 295,
965 P.2d at 1169-77 (cataloguing cases). The
Supreme Court of California's explanation,
for instance, involves four related rationales:
(1) if the condition set by the taker were not
met, the deprivation "would in fact have been
permanent"; (2) by conditioning the item's
return, the taker asserts a right of ownership
in the property that constitutes evidence of
the taker's intent to permanently deprive; (3)
taking property intending to return it only
upon the satisfaction of a condition "creates a
substantial risk of permanent loss"; and (4)
conditioning the item's return necessarily and
permanently "deprive[s] the owner of a portion
of the value of the property." <EM>Id.</EM> (internal
quotation marks and emphasis omitted).

<fnt6> In an effort to demonstrate that a robbery
conviction can be sustained even in the absence
of such concurrence, the government
suggests that "robbery continues as long as
the asportation," relying primarily on felony-murder
cases. Though we are skeptical of
the government's position, <EM>see Brown v. United
States,</EM> 35 App. D.C. 548, 552-58 (D.C.
Cir. 1910) (rejecting a continuing-trespass
theory of larceny), we adhere to our oft-reemphasized
policy of judicial restraint:
courts "should not decide more than the occasion
demands." <EM>District of Columbia v. Wical
Ltd. P'ship,</EM> 630 A.2d 174, 182 (D.C.
1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). As
we can affirm Mr. Alleyne's convictions without
resolving whether and to what extent
robbery requires concurrence, we leave that
question for another day.

<fnt7> Mr. Alleyne suggests&mdash;perhaps against his
own interest but understandably, as "our terminology
has not always been entirely clear
on this point," <EM>Fleming,</EM> 224 A.3d at 219&mdash;that
this court reviews jury instructions under an
abuse-of-discretion standard. While "we review
the trial court's decision to give [an]
instruction for abuse of discretion," <EM>Koonce v.
District of Columbia,</EM> 111 A.3d 1009, 1022
(D.C. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted),
"the accuracy of [an] instruction itself is
a legal question that we review de novo,"
<EM>Lucas v. United States,</EM> 240 A.3d 328, 343
(D.C. 2020), if the legal question was preserved.

<fnt8> Although the transcript contains some references
to a concurrence requirement, the
thrust of the argument made by Mr. Alleyne
was that the instructions for theft&mdash;<EM>unlike</EM>
those for robbery&mdash;did <EM>not</EM> require concurrence.
Mr. Alleyne therefore never flagged to
the trial court a concern that the trial court's
robbery instructions failed to communicate a
concurrence requirement. In fact, his arguments
regarding theft suggested the opposite.

<fnt9> When the trial court asked Mr. Alleyne to
clarify "what [he was] asking for," Mr. Alleyne
in substance repeated his initial objection:
"I would ask that he took the property
without right with specific intent to steal it."

<fnt10> This conclusion is reinforced by the trial
court's statements during the above back-and-forth.
The court made clear that, in its view,
robbery required an intent to permanently
deprive; indeed, it said, "in both [theft and
robbery,] the [g]overnment would be required
to prove an intent to permanently deprive the
person of the property." That statement suggests
that had Mr. Alleyne raised the argument
that he now raises on appeal, the trial
court would have been receptive to supplementing
the instructions. The fact that the
trial court made no change in response to the
objection, by contrast, indicates that the court
did not understand the objection as raising
the issue of permanent deprivation.

<fnt11> The government urges us to go beyond
forfeiture and find waiver&mdash;i.e., "an intentional
relinquishment or abandonment of a
known right or privilege." <EM>Allen,</EM> 495 A.2d at
1151 n.11 (internal quotation marks omitted).
Because&mdash;as we conclude below&mdash;no plain error
occurred, we need not address whether
Mr. Alleyne waived his argument.

<fnt12> The trial court again highlighted this relationship
as it turned to theft from robbery:
"Alright. The lesser included offense of second
degree theft."

<fnt13> Robbery and theft were the only offenses
for which the trial court provided such an
order of operations.

<fnt14> Although the District's "widely used" form
instructions provide a helpful guide, they are
"not the law." <EM>Lucas,</EM> 240 A.3d at 343 n.12
(internal quotation marks omitted). Use of
pattern jury instructions, therefore, does not
provide a sure safeguard against error.

<fnt15> The District's pattern instructions for theft
could be read to contemplate liability even
where an intent to deprive is lacking. Criminal
Jury Instructions for the District of Columbia,
No. 5.300 (5th ed. 2024) (stating that
the defendant must "<EM>either</EM> [intend] to deprive
... <EM>or</EM> [intend] to take or make use of the
property ... without authority or right" (emphasis
added)). As the issue is not before us,
we express no opinion on whether that portion
of the pattern instruction accurately reflects
the law.

[MT]
<P20>Plaintiff has served as the tax assessor
of defendant Township of Tewksbury
(Tewksbury) since 2007. An important aspect
of her job is to assess farmland applications
to determine their qualification for
farmland status, which results in a favorable
property tax designation for the owner.
Disagreements arose between plaintiff,
Tewksbury, and members of defendant
Township Committee of the Township of
Tewksbury (Township Committee) particularly
after plaintiff denied a Committee
member's&mdash;defendant Robert Becker&mdash;application
for farmland status. Tewksbury
unsuccessfully attempted to remove plaintiff
from her position.

<P20>Plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior
Court, alleging that defendants retaliated
against her in violation of the Conscientious
Employee Protection Act (CEPA),
N.J.S.A. 34:19-1 to -14, from 2008 to 2019
for objecting to their attempts to unlawfully
influence her assessment determinations
and operate a "tax scheme." Defendants
moved for summary judgment, asserting
plaintiff could not establish a CEPA cause
of action because she was not an "employee"
entitled to CEPA protection. On April
10, 2023, the trial court granted the motion.
The court relied on <EMU>Casamasino v.
City of Jersey City</EMU>, 304 N.J. Super. 226,
699 A.2d 697 (App. Div. 1997), <EMU>rev'd on
other grounds</EMU>, 158 N.J. 333, 730 A.2d 287
(1999), and found that, as a tenured and
statutorily protected tax assessor, plaintiff
is not an "employee" under CEPA.

<P20>After a careful review, we conclude that
<EMU>Casamasino</EMU> does not establish a bright
line rule that all tax assessors are exempt
from
<SPage 48>
CEPA protection. Despite the
unique position a tax assessor holds because
of the statutory protection from removal
from employment, a court determining
the applicability of CEPA should
assess the employment relationship under
the framework established in <EMU>Feldman v.
Hunterdon Radiological Assocs.</EMU>, 187 N.J.
228, 901 A.2d 322 (2006) and <EMU>D'Annunzio
v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.</EMU>, 192 N.J.
110, 927 A.2d 113 (2007). <EMU>See also Lippman
v. Ethicon, Inc.</EMU>, 222 N.J. 362, 119
A.3d 215 (2015). Therefore, we reverse
and vacate the order granting summary
judgment and remand for the consideration
of the factors articulated in <EMU>Feldman</EMU>
and <EMU>D'Annunzio</EMU> and a determination
whether plaintiff is an employee entitled
to CEPA protection.

<CN>I.

<P20>Plaintiff was initially appointed in December
2007 and is a tenured tax assessor.
As delineated in the Handbook for New
Jersey Assessors, issued by the State of
New Jersey, Department of the Treasury,
Division of Taxation, (Division), plaintiff's
duties and responsibilities include:

<B22>1. Discovery and location of all real
property and certain personal property
used in business in the taxing district; 2.
Listing and description of property in a
systematic, convenient manner through
MOD IV, N.J. Property Tax System; 3.
Determination of taxability based on a
wide variety of tax exemption and tax
<Page 491>
deduction statutes; 4. Valuation of property
through an appraisal of each property
and an assessment based on that
appraised value; 5. Tax equalization responsibilities
via district revaluation programs
and for purposes of distributing
State Aid to schools; 6. Defense of assessments
upon appeal.

<P20>Pursuant to an Interlocal Services
Agreement (Agreement) between Tewksbury
and the Town of Clinton, plaintiff
worked as a joint municipal tax assessor
for both towns from 2008 to 2012. Tewksbury
was identified as "the lead agency[]
and employer" of the joint assessor position;
the agreement could be terminated
any time by either municipality.

<P20>Per the agreement, plaintiff was to conduct
tax assessment services for twenty-one
hours a week during "normal office
hours" and be available for meetings "at
other times ... as needed." Seventeen and
one-half hours were allocated for Tewksbury
and
<SPage 49>
three and one-half hours for
Clinton. The initial salary was $45,000,
with two-thirds paid by Tewksbury and
one-third paid by Clinton.

<P20>According to plaintiff, shortly after being
hired, she discovered Tewksbury did
not have a farmland inspection program
in place nor a designated inspector. She
also learned that certain properties in
Tewksbury designated as farmland did
not have applications or documentation on
file for a farmland assessment to qualify
for farmland status. She advised the Tax
Administrator of the missing applications
and began tracking them down from other
municipalities where they were being
kept. After several weeks of working on
this project, she told the Administrator
there were still at least fifteen missing
files.

<P20>In October 2008, plaintiff sent a letter to
Tewksbury's Chief Financial Officer Judie
McGrorey<fnr1> "analyz[ing] the joint assessor's
position." Plaintiff stated she was
working an average of about ten extra
hours per month as a result of "the daunting
amount of mistakes by the previous
[a]ssessor," the lack of organization procedures
in the office, and the limited help.

<P20>Plaintiff also explained she was unable
to finish the yearly farmland inspections
during her twenty-one weekly hours "while
efficiently completing [her] other [a]ssessor
duties," so the inspections had to be
done during her personal time. She stated
the inspection fee was "$25 and by law this
fee can be passed to the landowner," so
the Township Committee could decide to
absorb the cost or bill the homeowner.
Plaintiff further stated:

<B22>The State has begun auditing farmland
applications and inspection logs so I
would need to begin inspections in April
of 2009. An excel spreadsheet will be
produced noting the farms inspected,
the results of the inspection[,] and date
of the inspection. The spreadsheet will
be used for billing ([i]<EMU>f the [Township
Committee] decides to bill homeowner[s]
and not absorb the cost</EMU>); payment for
the inspection and verification for the
State that Tewksbury is complying with
Farmland law.

<B22>[(emphasis in original).]
<SPage 50>

<P00>Lastly, plaintiff informed McGrorey of
her other work duties, which included researching,
inspecting, and correcting 173
property record mistakes.

<P20>From 2009 to 2014, plaintiff inspected
farmland properties on her own time
through a "self-funded inspection program."
She inspected the properties, generated
invoices, and received payments
from the landowners. She retained the $25
<Page 492>
inspection fee as compensation for this
work.

<P20>In July 2011, defendant Louis DiMare&mdash;
who was a Township Committee member
until 2019 and the Tewksbury Mayor in
2009, 2013, and 2018&mdash;emailed plaintiff informing
her that he received "a very irate"
call from a resident. The resident questioned
the $25 inspection fee and stated he
felt he was being harassed since an inspection
had been conducted the prior year.
The resident told DiMare that plaintiff did
not have permission to go on his property
without him being present; if she did so,
the resident threatened to file a complaint
for trespassing. DiMare asked plaintiff
what statutory authority she was relying
on for charging the inspection fee.

<P20>Plaintiff responded to DiMare by email
and carbon copied Municipal Clerk Roberta
Brassard, defendant Administrator
Jesse Landon, and McGrorey. She informed
DiMare she had just returned from
vacation that day, the resident did not
leave a return phone number for her to
reach him, and she had sent the resident
two letters&mdash;in 2009 and 2011&mdash;stating
N.J.S.A. 54:4-23.13 authorizes the inspection
fee. She also stated the fee paid by the
resident in 2009 was for years 2009-2011,
and that the fee paid in 2011 covers years
2012-2014.

<P20>In April 2012, Clinton asked plaintiff to
increase her office hours working for the
town, which plaintiff was willing to do.
However, Tewksbury would not agree to
the request and, thereafter, Clinton terminated
the agreement for the joint tax assessor.
As a result, Tewksbury reduced
plaintiff's hours to fourteen hours a week
and her annual salary decreased to
$31,671. Plaintiff contested the calculation
of the salary, asserting she should be paid
based on an
<SPage 51>
eighteen-hour work week,
with a corresponding salary of $40,720.
McGrorey responded that plaintiff would
work fourteen hours.

<P20>In 2013, plaintiff assessed and denied
defendant Robert Becker's application for
farmland status. Becker was a Township
Committee member and deputy mayor.
His subsequent appeal was denied. According
to plaintiff, DiMare informed her
that Becker and his wife had "complained
that [plaintiff] did not have time for them,"
and that DiMare stated "he didn't want to
influence [plaintiff] but ... could [she]
reach out to [the Beckers]." Plaintiff responded
that she "spent extensive time" at
the inspection and had informed the Beckers
that the rental property attached to
their home had value, and their listed sales
were non-usable. Plaintiff alleged that during
the conversation, DiMare asked for her
attorney's name.

<P20>According to plaintiff, DiMare "insisted"
she contact Becker to settle the tax appeal.
She told DiMare she did not get involved
in negotiations and that Becker should
contact the Hunterdon County Board of
Taxation regarding his appeal.

<P20>Plaintiff informed Tewksbury officials of
her conversation with DiMare, advising
that Becker and DiMare "were unlawfully
attempting to interfere with her duties and
to use political influence to cause [her] to
improperly settle the tax appeal." In response,
DiMare sent the following email to
Brassard and the Township Committee:

<B42>I want the full T[ownship Committee]
to be aware of [plaintiff's] missive[,] so I
am sending this reply to each fellow
T[ownship Committee] member for consideration
and their discussion on May
14. I believe they may need to treat this
as some sort of complaint either about
me, her scheduling or workload or compensation
and I believe they need to
conduct an inquiry into the reason for
her memo. [Counsel] should be consulted
on how to proceed[,] and I will of
<Page 493>
course recuse myself as to any issue of
my discussion with [plaintiff] and defend
my conduct if necessary as I did nothing
wrong here. As she states I did not try
to influence her in any way and made
that abundantly clear to her at the outset
of our conversation. But, her memo
in the absence of a reply could be construed
to imply otherwise. My phone call
to her, after having spoken to you, was
not improper and I am frankly surprised
by this and have to question the motivation
for it.

<B42>I understand that she also discussed
the fact that I had a conversation with
her with the tax commissioners outside
the presence of the tax appellants. If
that is
<SPage 52>
correct, I hope the appellants
were made aware of this and chose not
to participate. If not, I have to question
the propriety and prudence of such ex
parte communications. The appellants
should have been made aware of any
concerns she might have had that warranted
her discussion with the commissioners
about their appeal. We do not
operate in secret. Also, I believe that a
failure to include the appellants in that
discussion could expose [Tewksbury] to
a challenge to the results of the appeal
should the appellants so choose. That
would not be a good position for [Tewksbury]
and could prove costly in attorney
fees and otherwise.

<B42>Who she sent this to and why she did
not send me a copy are questions I
would also like answered so that I can
take appropriate action if necessary[,]
outside of any governmental inquiry. It
is only common courtesy to copy the
person you are making statements
about[,] and this was not done here. I
take my reputation very seriously and
will not stand idly by for anyone issuing
something that will impugn it.

<B42>During my brief discussion with her
she made it a point to tell me she
worked for Tewksbury on her day off
and she recites it again in her memo. If
she has compensation issues, work hours
issues or workload issues in connection
with the performance of her duties we
also need to know that. I told her I
would look into that if that [were] the
case[,] and it seems to be a significant
concern of hers so should we also discuss
it. I would also like a refresher on
what happened with her in Clinton to
better understand her concerns. Please
ask [the CFO] to weigh in on these
matters as well for discussion at our
meeting....

<B22>[(italicization omitted).]

<P20>Landon spoke with plaintiff and DiMare
about the events and memorialized the
conversations in a memorandum. Plaintiff
reported DiMare called her about Becker's
appeal and they spoke for approximately
thirty minutes. Plaintiff told Landon

<B22>the call was ... inappropriate and interfered
with her duty as the Tax Assessor
and the action is prohibited by statute.
[Plaintiff] stated that [DiMare] ...
asked for information and documents to
review ..., told her that his wife was a
friend of the tenant in Becker['s] apartment,
[and he] was not trying to influence
her. He questioned about the
comps, values etc. as typical in a tax
review or appeal.

<P20>Plaintiff told Landon she contacted
McGrorey, stating the call was inappropriate
and had intimidated her. Landon further
wrote that he

<B22>spoke to [the Tewksbury Attorney] and
the County Tax Administrator regarding
the matter, as there was general concern
about the call itself, and in particular[,]
we wondered if the call would disqualify
[plaintiff] from the appeal. Both
[the Tewksbury Attorney] and the
County Tax Administrator said that the
<Page 494>
call was not appropriate, but it would
not disqualify her or jeopardize the process.
At no time did [plaintiff] mention
to [McGrorey] or me anything about her
hours.

<B42>... When I spoke to [DiMare] he
denied any wrongdoing or inappropriate
conversation and indicated the call was
brief and only asking [plaintiff] to call
<SPage 53>
[Becker's wife]. He asked me to forward
her email to him and his response
to the other TC members. He asked
about the results of the hearings and
how many appeals were approved as
recommended by [plaintiff]. He also
asked about the agreement with Clinton
and if I knew why they had ended it.

<P20>The memorandum further stated:

<B42>The matter was reviewed at the May
14 Township Committee meeting, at
which time I was tasked to meet with
[plaintiff] and [McGrorey] to go over the
letter and see how [plaintiff] wanted to
proceed. We did meet on Wednesday,
and after reading the response from [DiMare,]
she indicated his version was not
quite what happened, but reiterated that
she only wanted the calls like this to
stop.

<B42>I relayed this to [DiMare], who responded
he would not speak to her in
the future without me being present or
on a conference call with her.

<P20>In June 2015, plaintiff sent an email to
Tewksbury's CFO Marie Kenia and carbon
copied Landon, stating she was "concerned
that an inspector ha[d] not been named to
do the farmland inspections." Plaintiff attached
a copy of "the responsibilities of the
[T]ax [A]ssessor's office" to the email and
advised she was only able to complete
approximately 20 of the required 183 inspections
during her normal working
hours, and that the number of farmers
requesting plaintiff's review of their applications
will "increase drastically." Plaintiff
also indicated the need to develop an inspection
program to conduct inspections
that Tewksbury had already collected fees
for and "are statutorily required."

<P20>Kenia responded that afternoon, stating
that, as she understood it, plaintiff was
responsible for the inspections, the Township
Committee no longer wanted to pay
her to conduct inspections during her personal
time, plaintiff had to complete as
many inspections as she could during the
summer, and they would meet sometime in
the summer to discuss possibly getting
some help for plaintiff to complete the
inspections.

<P20>Plaintiff responded in a letter, stating:

<B22>I am devastated that you have perceived
my inability to perform farmland inspections
as a lack of teamwork. As per our
[recent] conversation ..., this misperception
has impacted my annual merit
increase. Therefore, I am requesting
that we work together to find a reasonable
solution and formalize in writing
how to proceed.

<B42>The situation has been analyzed and a
very conservative estimate of 100 hours
a year is required to process the 186-farmland
inspections. This equates to
approximately
<SPage 54>
[two] hours per week,
an increase of 14% above my contractual
[fourteen] hours per week. Completing
farmland inspections is not only a statutory
requirement, but also ethically necessary
as [Tewksbury] has already accepted
the $25 dollar fee from these
taxpayers for the inspection.

<P00>Plaintiff presented five options to Kenia as
ways to accomplish the inspections.

<P20>In plaintiff's May 2016 performance review,
Kenia stated: "[PLAINTIFF] IS A
VERY COMPETENT AND PROFESSIONAL
WORKER. SHE IS EXTREMELY
KNOWLEDGEABLE
ABOUT HER PROFESSION. SHE HAS
<Page 495>
A VERY OUTGOING PERSONALITY
AND IS ALWAYS IN A VERY POSITIVE
MOOD. SHE IS VERY PLEASANT
TO WORK WITH." (boldface omitted).
In the document, plaintiff wrote that
her goal was to obtain approval to increase
her hours and compensation "in order to
facilitate the farmland inspections that
[were] now required during [her] normal
office hours." Kenia wrote beneath it, "I
support [plaintiff's] goal."

<P20>In February 2017, plaintiff emailed Landon
and Kenia requesting they consider,
during the budget review, increasing her
hours to twenty-one hours with an annual
salary of $51,936.76. She said the "proposed
schedule of [expanded] office hours
would satisfy [her] performance appraisal
goal ... of increasing office hours to facilitate
the responsibilities of the tax assessor."
Plaintiff reminded the administrators
that "the responsibility of farmland inspections
was added to the current [fourteen]
hours a week tax assessor office hours" in
2015 and that "[w]orkload and time constraints
have not allowed scheduled inspections
to be conducted" even though "the
$25 inspection fee for the 2015-2017 inspection
cycle has been collected from the
taxpayer." (emphasis omitted). Plaintiff advised
that 425 inspections had to be completed
by the end of the 2017 cycle.

<P20>In September 2017, plaintiff sent an
email to Administrator John Eskilson and
Kenia, inquiring if a decision had been
made regarding her request for increased
hours and compensation. She stated she
had "at least [seventy] files to review and
assess," the deadline for added/omitted assessments
was September 29, and
<SPage 55>
that
"[she] [was] very concerned about ...
complet[ing]" the work. The next day,
Eskilson replied that while no formal decision
had been made, her request was not
supported.

<P20>In plaintiff's April 2018 performance review,
Kenia stated:

<B22>[PLAINTIFF] IS A VERY COMPETENT
AND PROFESSIONAL
WORKER. SHE IS EXTREMELY
KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT HER
PROFESSION. SHE HAS A VERY
STRONG OUTGOING PERSONALITY
AND IS ALWAYS IN A VERY
POSITIVE MOOD. SHE HAS BEEN
UPDATING THE TAX MAPS IN
PREPARATION FOR A TOWN
WIDE REASSESSMENT IN THE
COMING YEAR OR TWO. WE HAVE
STARTED TO BUDGET FOR THIS
EXPENSE.

<B22>[(boldface omitted).]

<P20>Under the "GOALS" section, it stated:
"[PLAINTIFF] WILL BE GETTING
QUOTES ON COMPANIES THAT
WILL DO OUR REASSESSMENT. SHE
HAS BEEN PREPARING HER RECORDS
TO HELP ASSIST WITH THE
PROCESS." (boldface omitted). Underneath
these comments, plaintiff wrote, "As
discussed, I'm very disappointed that my
request for additional hours for the [t]ax
[a]ssessor's workload was denied."

<P20>On April 10, 2018, the Committee
adopted Resolution #67-2018, which recognized
plaintiff for her work as tax assessor
and the "countless hours" she worked to
"serve the citizens of ... Tewksbury."

<P20>The following month, Tax Board Administrator
Tony Porto sent a letter to Brassard
informing that the Hunterdon County
Board of Taxation had ordered Tewksbury
to complete a municipal-wide revaluation
of all its properties in 2019 for the 2020 tax
year. The order, signed by the Director of
the Division, required the municipal tax
assessor to "submit to the county tax administrator
a written plan to demonstrate
compliance with the terms of the revaluation
order." The plan was to be updated
and submitted the first of each month.
<Page 496>

<P20>In June 2018, plaintiff reiterated her
request for increased hours and salary.
She also provided Brassard and Kenia
with an update regarding farmland inspections,
stating in her memorandum:
<SPage 56>

<B22>Attached please find the Farmland Inspection
History. The Tax Assessor is
awaiting direction as to who will be completing
the required farmland inspections.

<B42>&bull; Option 1: The Assessor could on her
off time inspect the farms and receive a
$25 inspection fee (one fee per owner) or

<B42>&bull; Option 2: A staff member could be
taught how to inspect and be required to
defend a denial in front of the Hunterdon
County Tax Board.

<B42>&bull; Option 3: An experienced farmland
Inspector could be hired.

<B22><EMU>The Tax Assessor would like to continue
to do the farmland inspections as the
assessor is responsible for the approval/denial
of all farmland applications. If
Option 1 is chosen, inspections would
need to be completed on personal hours
as the office hours cannot sustain additional
work.</EMU>

<B22>[(emphasis in original).]

<P20>Several months later, plaintiff emailed
Brassard and attorney Francis P. Linnus,
stating:

<B42>This letter is to express my concern
regarding the treatment and the way I
was spoken to by ... Becker in reference
to my request for additional office
hours. At [the June 12 and September
11, 2018] meetings, ... Becker aggressively
questioned me appearing to have
a personal issue by personally attacking
the way I conduct the business of the
Tax Assessor office.

<B42>The September 11th council meeting
made it clear that this is personal.
Amongst other criticisms, ... Becker
stated that I do not negotiate on appeals
such as his. A Tax Assessor reports
directly to the County Tax Administrator
therefore, the governing body of a
municipality [cannot] influence the assessing
procedures. Non-negotiation for
County Tax appeals has been and will
continue to be my policy. It takes a fair
amount of time to review and recommend
a settlement or initiate the defense
of the appeal. In fairness, uniformity,
and equability to all taxpayers;
this procedure will remain in effect.

<B42>My perception is that this treatment
is a retaliation of ... Becker's 2013 appeal.
Attached to this email are the documents
relating to his 2013 appeal from
my personnel file. Please consider having
... Becker recuse himself from all
discussions of my office hours and procedures
in light of this bias and conflict of
interest.

<P20>In March 2019, Tewksbury entered into
an agreement with Appraisal Systems, Inc.
(ASI) "to revalue all the lands, buildings[,]
and improvements contained within the
boundaries of [Tewksbury] and ... to render
necessary advice and assistance." This
project was to commence October 1, 2019,
and was to be effective for the 2020 tax
year. Tewksbury agreed to compensate
ASI $207,785 for its services. ASI completed
its work in late January 2020.

<P20>In July 2019, plaintiff emailed ASI, informing
them of several complaints she
received pertaining to the revaluation inspections.
One complainant was DiMare&mdash;
as told to her by Becker&mdash;who
<SPage 57>
said the
inspector had "an attitude" after being
questioned. The inspectors responded that
DiMare was "confrontational" and stated
he would call the police if the inspector did
not leave the property.

<P20>In August 2019, the Division informed
Tewksbury that its audit revealed one-third
of the farmland properties had not
<Page 497>
been inspected within the three-year statutory
time requirement.

<P20>In January 2020, plaintiff advised she
worked seventy hours that month and requested
$3,827.60 in compensation. Her request
was denied.

<P20>Later that year, Business Administrator
James Barberio sent plaintiff a Notice of
Disciplinary Action, delineating three incidents
where plaintiff had "fail[ed] [in her]
performance" as tax assessor: plaintiff "did
not investigate properties with a Farmland
Assessment to confirm that they continued
to qualify for the reduced tax rate" within
the time required under the statute but
instead contracted with ASI to bring the
inspections up to date; plaintiff failed to
give ASI ten days' notice of delinquency
when it did not timely complete the revaluation
work, resulting in a loss to Tewksbury
of approximately $15,000 because it
could not demand liquidated damages; and
plaintiff "ha[d] not accepted responsibility
for the[se] performance failures or acknowledged
that [she] committed errors in
the performance of [her] statutory duties."
The Notice concluded that the Township
Committee had lost "confidence in [plaintiff's]
abilities and judgment, leaving no
recourse, th[e]n to seek [her] removal from
office."

<P20>Barberio offered plaintiff a lump sum of
$4,000 as severance in exchange for the
release of any claims plaintiff had against
Tewksbury, and her resignation from her
position as tax assessor. If plaintiff did not
sign the severance agreement, Tewksbury
intended to seek her removal.

<P20>On September 2, 2020, Tewksbury submitted
a complaint for plaintiff's removal
to the Division pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:1-35.31.
The complaint stated there was good
cause for plaintiff's removal
<SPage 58>
as she "demonstrated
failure to economically and efficiently
perform her statutory duties,
thereby affecting the proper administration
of [Tewksbury]." The complaint alleged
plaintiff failed to give ASI notice of
its deficiencies as stipulated under the contract,
which cost defendant Tewksbury
$15,000; plaintiff failed to inspect properties
that were required by law to be inspected
every three years and failed to
take responsibility for those failed inspections;
and plaintiff overstepped her authority
when she gave "erroneous advice" to
residents who sought to appeal their assessments,
resulting in the denial of those
appeals. Thereafter, Tewksbury sent the
Division several supplemental letters with
additional information in support of its
complaint for removal.

<CN>A.

<P20>In October 2020, plaintiff filed a complaint
against defendants in New Jersey
Superior Court alleging defendants retaliated
against her in violation of CEPA. She
stated she was "subjected to intentional,
repeated, and unlawful retaliation for objecting
to [d]efendants' unlawful attempts
to engage in a fraudulent tax scheme and,
worse, cover it up." She further alleged:

<B22>Defendants have repeatedly attempted
to have their unqualified properties designated
as "farmland," allowing them to
take improper property tax breaks and
shifting that tax burden to other county
residents. Plaintiff, a tax assessor for
... Tewksbury ..., has been an unwavering
roadblock to [d]efendants' efforts
to utilize political influence and abuse
their powers to illicitly obtain favorable
tax treatment for themselves (or their
friends).

<P20>Plaintiff contended Becker and DiMare
were close friends and conspired together
to "interfere with the property tax assessment
and retaliate against [her]." She further
stated: "Not only did [d]efendants'
retaliatory conduct toward [p]laintiff violate
<Page 498>
the law, it also undermined the requirement
that tax assessors remain completely
independent and free from political
influence."

<P20>On January 29, 2021, the Division denied
Tewksbury's removal request, stating that
after an investigation, the Director "d[id]
not find [plaintiff's] alleged conduct ...
warrant[ed] removal from office." In addressing
the first allegation, the Division
found
<SPage 59>
Tewksbury was the party to the
ASI contract, not plaintiff, and the Township
Committee knew ASI was unable to
meet the deadline and "had the opportunity
to direct [plaintiff] to take the steps
necessary to exercise the liquidating damages
provision[,] but did not do so." Therefore,
the Division "d[id] not find that
[plaintiff] failed to perform her assessment
duties on this point."

<P20>In considering the second allegation, the
Division found that Tewksbury conceded
the delinquency in the assessment inspections
no longer existed. The Division further
found that plaintiff agreed to develop
an inspection plan, and her supervisors
would ensure any future discrepancies
would be corrected in subsequent tax
years. Therefore, there was no basis for
removal on those grounds.

<P20>In turning to Tewksbury's third allegation,
the Division found the allegation
"d[id] not appear to actually implicate
[plaintiff]," as she "acted well within the
duties of the assessor in providing basic
information to taxpayers concerning their
potential appeals." He found removal was
not warranted on this point. The Division
similarly found no merit in any of Tewksbury's
supplemental filings.

<P20>Thereafter, defendants moved to dismiss
plaintiff's Superior Court complaint, asserting
the allegations were barred by the
one-year statute of limitations applicable
to CEPA claims. The court denied the
motion.

<CN>B.

<P20>Defendants later moved for summary
judgment, asserting: plaintiff has not been
demoted or reassigned, nor deprived of
benefits; plaintiff's salary and hours were
reduced by approximately one-third because
Clinton terminated the joint agreement
and plaintiff was no longer working
for Clinton; they never impeded plaintiff
from completing inspections, and plaintiff
did not report that defendants committed
unlawful activity to any supervisors, legal
enforcement, or regulatory authorities.
<SPage 60>

<P20>On April 10, 2023, the trial court
granted defendants' motion. In its written
decision, the court relied on <EMU>Casamasino</EMU>,
304 N.J. Super. at 226, 699 A.2d 697, and
stated that because of a tax assessor's
unique position, they "are outside the
scope of CEPA and cannot bring valid
CEPA claims against their employers."
Therefore, the trial court found plaintiff
"failed to create any genuine issue of fact
as to whether she is the type of employee
CEPA was intended to protect." The court
stated:

<B22>Just like the tax assessor in <EMU>Casamasino</EMU>,
plaintiff cannot legitimately claim to
have held a deep-rooted fear that her
employment would be stripped away by
her employer. Plaintiff performed her
duties as an independent assessor and
continuously voiced her concerns and opposition
to her employers. That she felt
vulnerable in her position following her
adverse interactions with her employers
is of no consequence. Plaintiff could not
be&mdash;and was not&mdash;terminated from her
position by her employers.

<CN>II.

<P20>On appeal, plaintiff contends the trial
court erred in finding all municipal tax
assessors are excluded from raising a
<Page 499>
CEPA claim. Instead, the court should
have conducted a factual analysis to determine
whether plaintiff was an "employee"
under CEPA.

<P20>We review a trial court's decision on a
motion for summary judgment de novo,
"applying the same standard used by the
trial court." <EMU>Samolyk v. Berthe</EMU>, 251 N.J.
73, 78, 276 A.3d 108 (2022). A motion for
summary judgment should be granted
when "there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact challenged and ... the moving
party is entitled to a judgment or
order as a matter of law." <EMU>R.</EMU> 4:46-2(c). The
court should "consider whether the competent
evidential materials presented, when
viewed in the light most favorable to the
non-moving party, are sufficient to permit
a rational factfinder to resolve the alleged
disputed issue in favor of the non-moving
party." <EMU>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of
Am.</EMU>, 142 N.J. 520, 540, 666 A.2d 146
(1995).

<P20>"We review issues of statutory interpretation
de novo." <EMU>Kocanowski v. Twp.
of Bridgewater</EMU>, 237 N.J. 3, 9, 203 A.3d 95
(2019). "A trial court's interpretation of the
law and the legal
<SPage 61>
consequences that flow
from established facts are not entitled to
any special deference." <EMU>Rowe v. Bell &
Gossett Co.</EMU>, 239 N.J. 531, 552, 218 A.3d
784 (2019) (quoting <EMU>Manalapan Realty,
L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan</EMU>, 140
N.J. 366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995)).

<P20>"[CEPA] protects workers who
blow the whistle on their employers' illegal,
fraudulent, or otherwise improper activities
that implicate the health, safety,
and welfare of the public." <EMU>D'Annunzio</EMU>, 192
N.J. at 114, 927 A.2d 113. The statute "is
remedial social legislation designed to promote
two complementary public purposes:
`to protect and [thereby] encourage employees
to report illegal or unethical workplace
activities and to discourage public
and private sector employers from engaging
in such conduct.'" <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 119, 927 A.2d
113 (alteration in original) (quoting <EMU>Yurick
v. State</EMU>, 184 N.J. 70, 77, 875 A.2d 898
(2005)). Because CEPA is a remedial statute,
it "should be construed liberally to
effectuate its important social goal." <EMU>Chiofalo
v. State</EMU>, 238 N.J. 527, 540, 213 A.3d
900 (2019) (quoting <EMU>Battaglia v. UPS</EMU>, 214
N.J. 518, 555, 70 A.3d 602 (2013)).

<P20>CEPA protects against retaliatory
action taken by an employer against an
employee. A cause of action pursuant to
CEPA requires the following proofs:

<B22>(1) [the employee] reasonably believed
that [their] employer's conduct was violating
either a law, rule, or regulation
promulgated pursuant to law, or a clear
mandate of public policy; (2) [the employee]
performed a "whistle-blowing"
activity described in N.J.S.A. 34:19-3(c);
(3) an adverse employment action was
taken against [them]; and (4) a causal
connection exists between the whistle-blowing
activity and the adverse employment
action.

<B22>[<EMU>Battaglia</EMU>, 214 N.J. at 556, 70 A.3d 602
(quoting <EMU>Dzwonar v. McDevitt</EMU>, 177 N.J.
451, 462, 828 A.2d 893 (2003)).]

<P20>Under the statute, "`[e]mployee' means
any individual who performs services for
and under the control and direction of an
employer for wages or other remuneration."
N.J.S.A. 34:19-2(b). Our Supreme
Court has stated that "[t]here are no exceptions
to that generic definition"; instead,
"our case law has taken an inclusive
approach in determining who constitutes
an employee for
<SPage 62>
purposes of invoking the
protection provided through this remedial
legislation." <EMU>Lippman</EMU>, 222 N.J. at 379, 119
A.3d 215.

<P20>Plaintiff asserts the trial court did not
conduct a fact-based analysis of her status
as an employee as required under <EMU>Feldman</EMU>,
<EMU>D'Annunzio</EMU>, and <EMU>Lippman</EMU>. Although
<Page 500>
the court referenced the statutory definition,
it relied solely on this court's holding
in <EMU>Casamasino</EMU> to conclude plaintiff was
barred from pursuing a CEPA claim due
to the job security afforded her as a tax
assessor under N.J.S.A. 54:1-35.31 and
N.J.S.A. 40A:9-165.

<P20>After a careful review of the statutory
principles undergirding CEPA, as well as
our Supreme Court decisions in <EMU>Casamasino</EMU>,
<EMU>Feldman</EMU>, <EMU>D'Annunzio</EMU> and <EMU>Stomel v.
City of Camden</EMU>, 192 N.J. 137, 927 A.2d 129
(2007), we are satisfied the Court has not
established a bright line rule excluding a
municipal tax assessor from CEPA protection.
A court must still consider a tax
assessor-plaintiff's employee status and
the "reality of plaintiff's relationship with
the party against whom the CEPA claim is
advanced." <EMU>Feldman</EMU>, 187 N.J. at 241, 901
A.2d 322.

<P20>We begin with a discussion of the <EMU>Casamasino</EMU>
cases&mdash;decided ten years before
<EMU>Feldman</EMU> and <EMU>D'Annunzio</EMU>.

<P20>In <EMU>Casamasino</EMU>, the plaintiff was appointed
by the mayor in 1987 as the municipal
tax assessor after the former tax assessor
died in office. 304 N.J. Super. at
230, 699 A.2d 697. "[T]he city council did
not vote its advice and consent to the
appointment...." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 231, 699 A.2d
697. The plaintiff completed the term and
continued to hold the position for an additional
four-year term without being officially
reappointed. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> In 1993, when the
four-year term expired, the new mayor&mdash;
defendant Bret Schundler&mdash;informed
plaintiff he would not be reappointed and
instructed him to immediately vacate the
office. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>The plaintiff filed a complaint in lieu of
prerogative writs and order to show cause
alleging his removal was "retaliatory, illegal[,]
and motivated by [Schundler's] `personal
animosity'" against him, in violation
of CEPA, among other claims. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> He
alleged that
<SPage 63>
after he opposed a tax reassessment
and reevaluation plan proposed
by Schundler during a city council meeting
in 1988, Schundler threatened to embarrass
the plaintiff at every opportunity. <EMU>Id.</EMU>
at 232, 699 A.2d 697.

<P20>On the return date of the order to show
cause, the trial court reinstated the plaintiff
as the tenured tax assessor, finding
that the city council had ratified his appointment
as tax assessor by allowing him
to stay in office and serve in the role. <EMU>Id.</EMU>
at 233, 699 A.2d 697. The defendants subsequently
moved for summary judgment
on the remaining claims. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 234, 699
A.2d 697. The trial court granted the motion
as to the CEPA claim, finding the
plaintiff had not demonstrated a CEPA
violation since Schundler's proposal was
never enacted and the plaintiff's objection
to the proposal did not meet the requirements
of the statute. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 234-35, 699
A.2d 697.

<P20>The defendants appealed the order reinstating
the plaintiff as a tenured tax assessor;
the plaintiff cross-appealed the dismissal
of his CEPA claim, asserting he
was retaliated against because he "blew
the whistle" on Schundler's proposal to
implement a tax revaluation and reassessment
plan that the plaintiff believed violated
state tax guidelines. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 240-41, 699
A.2d 697. We affirmed the trial court's
orders reinstating the plaintiff to his position
and the dismissal of the remaining
claims.

<P20>In affirming the dismissal of the CEPA
claim, this court considered the purpose of
CEPA as articulated by the Supreme
Court in <EMU>Abbamont v. Piscataway Twp.
Bd. of Educ.</EMU>, 138 N.J. 405, 417-18, 650
A.2d 958 (1994), and the comments of Governor
Thomas Kean regarding the enactment
of the law.
<Page 501>

<B22>When signing the whistleblower law,
Governor Kean explained CEPA's purpose:

<B44>It is most unfortunate&mdash;but, nonetheless,
true&mdash;that conscientious employees
have been subjected to firing,
demotion[,] or suspension for calling
attention to illegal activity on the
part of his or her employer. It is
just as unfortunate that illegal activities
have not been brought to light
because of the deep-seated fear on
the part of an employee that his or
her livelihood will be taken away
without recourse.
<SPage 64>

<B22>[<EMU>Casamasino</EMU>, 304 N.J. Super. at 241,
699 A.2d 697 (quoting <EMU>Abbamont</EMU>, 138
N.J. at 417-18, 650 A.2d 958).]

<P20>This court found that based on the legislative
purpose, the plaintiff was "not the
type of employee [CEPA] was intended to
protect" because as tax assessor, he "enjoy[ed]
a unique, independent status ...
due to his statutorily created job security,"
because of his tenure and that he could
only be removed from office by the Director
of the Division or the Superior
Court in an action brought by the Director.
<EMU>Casamasino</EMU>, 304 N.J. Super. at
241-42, 699 A.2d 697. This court found the
plaintiff was not "the type of employee
who harbored `deep-rooted fear ... that
his ... livelihood [would] be taken away' if
he [spoke] out against his employer's `activities,
policies or practices.'" <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> (alterations
in original). Therefore, this court
concluded "the Jersey City tax assessor is
outside of CEPA's scope."<fnr2> <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 242, 699
A.2d 697.

<P20>The Supreme Court granted both parties'
petitions for certification. <EMU>Casamasino
v. City of Jersey City</EMU>, 158 N.J. 333, 730
A.2d 287 (1999). At the start of the opinion,
Justice Coleman stated:

<B22>The specific issue is whether an individual
appointed by a mayor, without the
"advice and consent" of the municipal
council as required by statute, to fill an
unexpired term of sixty-four days to be
followed by a four-year full term as tax
assessor, acquires tenure after serving
for six years in that capacity.

<B22>[<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 339, 730 A.2d 287.]

<P20>The Court reversed this court's decision
to reinstate the plaintiff as a tenured tax
assessor, holding a tax assessor could not
acquire tenure without undergoing the
statutory reappointment process. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> The
Court did not review or discuss this court's
ruling on the CEPA issue or whether a tax
assessor is an employee under the statute.
<SPage 65>

<P20>However, in the ensuing years, the
Court did address the CEPA definition of
an "employee" and established a factor-based
analysis to use in each specific circumstance.

<P20>In <EMU>Feldman</EMU>, the plaintiff was a radiologist
and shareholder-director of a radiology
group. 187 N.J. at 231, 901 A.2d 322.
She shared equally with the other shareholder-directors
in the group's profits and
losses and had an equal vote in the business
decisions. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 232, 901 A.2d 322.
After disagreements arose with the other
shareholder-directors regarding the
group's practices, Feldman felt "marginalized"
and eventually left the group. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at
235-36, 901 A.2d 322. She subsequently
filed a complaint alleging unlawful retaliation
under CEPA in addition to other
claims. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 236-37, 901 A.2d 322.

<P20>The trial court found Feldman was not
an employee under the statute. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 231,
<Page 502>
901 A.2d 322. We reversed. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> The
Court granted the defendants' petition for
certification to determine whether a shareholder-director
is an employee under
CEPA. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 231-32, 901 A.2d 322.

<P20>In its analysis, the Court discussed <EMU>Casamasino</EMU>
as a case that "establish[ed] a
general approach for determining employee
status as contemplated by CEPA,"
which is that "courts must look to the
goals underlying CEPA and focus not on
labels but on the reality of plaintiff's relationship
with the party against whom the
CEPA claim is advanced." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 241, 901
A.2d 322. The Court discussed <EMU>Casamasino</EMU>'s
"focus[] on control, employment protection,
and the purposes underlying
CEPA," and its reasoning that the tax
assessor plaintiff was not the type of employee
to harbor a deep-rooted fear of
losing their income due to the tax assessor's
"statutorily created protections,"
which made the position "unique." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at
240, 901 A.2d 322.

<P20>The <EMU>Feldman</EMU> Court considered the statutory
definition of employee under CEPA
and found the plaintiff partially satisfied
the definition as she performed services as
a radiologist for the group for which she
was compensated. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 239, 901 A.2d 322.
However, the Court had to determine
whether the "plaintiff was sufficiently
<SPage 66>
subject to [the group's] `control and direction'
that she could reasonably be considered
an employee rather than an employer."
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>In discussing the issue, the <EMU>Feldman</EMU>
Court adopted the then-recent United
States Supreme Court's analysis in <EMU>Clackamas
Gastroenterology Assocs., P.C. v.
Wells</EMU>, 538 U.S. 440, 449, 123 S.Ct. 1673,
155 L.Ed.2d 615 (2003). <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 247, 901
A.2d 322. In <EMU>Clackamas</EMU>, the Court was
tasked with determining a shareholder-director's
"employee" status under the
Americans with Disabilities Act, 42
U.S.C.A. &sect;&sect; 12101-12213. 538 U.S. at 441-42,
123 S.Ct. 1673. It established a non-exhaustive
six factor test and remanded to
the Ninth Circuit to consider the facts in
light of the test factors.<fnr3> <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 449-50, 123
S.Ct. 1673.

<P20>The <EMU>Feldman</EMU> Court found the "six-factor
<EMU>Clackamas</EMU> test [was] an appropriate
point of departure in analyzing a shareholder-director's
employee status under
CEPA." 187 N.J. at 247, 901 A.2d 322. The
Court said:

<B22>[I]t is not the shareholder-director's delineated
status that is pivotal; rather, the
focus should be on the party's true power
and influence within the organization.
Thus, there is no per se bar to a shareholder-director
being denominated as an
"employee" nor is there a per se conclusion
that a shareholder-director subject
to an "employment agreement" is an
employee. Each case must be considered
on its merits and there is no "shorthand
formula or magic phrase to determine
whether a shareholder-director is an employee
or an employer." The determination
<Page 503>
whether a
<SPage 67>
shareholder-director is
an employee depends on "all of the incidents
of the relationship ... with no one
factor being decisive."

<B44>....

<B42>... Indeed, <EMU>Clackamas</EMU> echoed what
our case law previously established in
cognate contexts: neither the label on
the position nor the duties set forth in
an employment contract are determinative
of whether an individual is an employee;
any relevant matter may be considered,
with no particular weight to be
accorded to any one factor; and the focus
should be on the actual power and
influence of the party within the organization
because "control" is the principal
guidepost.

<B22>[<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 244-47, 901 A.2d 322 (citations
omitted).]

<P20>In <EMU>D'Annunzio</EMU>, the Court again had occasion
to consider the definition of an
employee under CEPA, this time in the
context of whether the plaintiff was an
employee or independent contractor. 192
N.J. at 114, 927 A.2d 113.

<P20>D'Annunzio was a chiropractic medical
director in the defendant's Personal Injury
Protection Department. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 115, 927
A.2d 113. His one-year employment agreement
included language that characterized
his position as an independent contractor,
and either party could terminate the relationship
"without cause on sixty-days['] notice."
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 116, 927 A.2d 113. D'Annunzio
alleged he was terminated, in violation of
CEPA, after complaining about the defendant's
"lack of regulatory and contractual
compliance." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 118, 927 A.2d 113. The
trial court granted the defendant summary
judgment, after applying the <EMU>Pukowsky</EMU><fnr4>
test, and finding <EMU>D'Annunzio</EMU>
<SPage 68>
was an independent
contractor and not an employee
entitled to CEPA protection. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 125,
927 A.2d 113. We reversed. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>In its consideration, the Court noted the
CEPA definition of employee did not exclude
"persons who are designated as independent
contractors performing services
for an employer for remuneration." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at
121, 927 A.2d 113. The Court reiterated
the principle articulated in <EMU>Feldman</EMU> that a
court

<B22>must look beyond the label attached to
the relationship. The considerations that
must come into play are three: (1) employer
control; (2) the worker's economic
dependence on the work relationship;
and (3) the degree to which there has
been a functional integration of the employer's
business with that of the person
doing the work at issue.

<B22>[<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 122, 927 A.2d 113.]

<P00>It also reaffirmed its acceptance of the
<EMU>Pukowsky</EMU> test as appropriate for CEPA
purposes. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>The Court found that D'Annunzio had
"pointed to many facts that support[ed]
the creation of an employment relationship
<Page 504>
for CEPA purposes, notwithstanding
that his agreement described him as an
independent contractor": his time working
onsite at defendant's location was "continuous,
week to week, and daily, for a substantial
period of time during business
hours"; his duties included following protocols
to complete administrative tasks;
and he was given step-by-step instructions
on how to review claims and write reviews.
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 126-27, 927 A.2d 113. Therefore,
the Court affirmed this court's decision
reversing summary judgment. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at
127, 927 A.2d 113.

<P20>Similarly, in <EMU>Stomel</EMU>, the Court found the
plaintiff, a tenured public defender who
could only be removed for good cause, was
an employee under CEPA after conducting
a factual analysis of the work relationship.
192 N.J. at 155-56, 927 A.2d 129. The
Court reaffirmed the standards set forth in
<EMU>Pukowsky</EMU>, as discussed in <EMU>D'Annunzio</EMU>,
and determined the plaintiff had established
a prima facie case that he was an
employee for CEPA purposes. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 154-55,
927 A.2d 129.
<SPage 69>

<P20>This lengthy review of the legal precedent
reveals the Supreme Court has not
established a bright line rule that a tax
assessor is barred from bringing a CEPA
claim. Although we acknowledge this
court's statement in <EMU>Casamasino</EMU> and cannot
fault the trial court for its reliance on
it, nevertheless in the ensuing decades, our
Supreme Court has reaffirmed numerous
times the central principles of CEPA, its
liberal construction, and the need not to
simply rely on an employee's label but to
apply a fact-based inquiry into the particular
circumstances. Therefore, although <EMU>Casamasino</EMU>
was instructive and led to the
development of the "general approach" for
addressing the CEPA employee definition,
the Supreme Court has never singled out
municipal tax assessors as the sole persons
who are subject to a per se bar from
instituting a CEPA action. We see no reason
that plaintiff should not be accorded
the same fact analysis inquiry as to her
employee status as afforded to every other
individual.

<P20>We recognize that <EMU>Casamasino</EMU>
found the plaintiff was exempt from CEPA
protection because she was in a tenured
position and could not be removed from
office other than by the Division. However,
although a municipality cannot directly remove
a tax assessor from their position,
they can file a complaint with the Division
supporting the removal. And defendants
here took that action, after first asking
plaintiff to resign. So, plaintiff was fearful
of losing her position. Through the years,
defendants had reduced her work hours
and decreased her salary. She was reprimanded
and belittled by defendants and
members of the governing body. Defendants
also required her to work on her
own time to complete an essential function
of the job. She contends these actions created
a hostile environment that was in
retaliation for her reports regarding defendants'
behavior and failure to comply with
the pertinent laws and regulations. We
discern no reason why a person in these
circumstances should not have the opportunity
to demonstrate a prima facia CEPA
case and be afforded a fact-based inquiry
into whether she is an employee entitled to
CEPA protection.
<SPage 70>

<P20>Therefore, we reverse and vacate the
order granting defendants' summary judgment
and remand to the trial court for an
analysis of the factors as articulated in
<EMU>Feldman</EMU> and <EMU>D'Annunzio</EMU>. We leave it to
the trial court's discretion whether to permit
new briefing on the issues.

this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.

<CN>I. Introduction

<P20>The present matter has arisen out of
declaratory judgment actions filed with
this court by eleven of twelve Mercer
County municipalities seeking to establish
Third Round Housing Elements and Fair
Share Plans under New Jersey's <EMU>Mount
Laurel</EMU> Affordable Housing Doctrine. <EMU>In re
Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 & 5:97 by N.J.
Council on Affordable Hous.</EMU>, 221 N.J. 1,
110 A.3d 31 (2015) ("<EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU>"); <EMU>S.
Burlington Cnty. NAACP v. Township of
Mount Laurel</EMU>, 67 N.J. 151, 174, 336 A.2d
713 (1975) ("<EMU>Mount Laurel I</EMU>"); <EMU>In re Adoption</EMU>
<Page 516>
<EMU>of N.J.A.C. 5:94 & 5:95</EMU>, 390 N.J.
Super. 1, 15, 914 A.2d 348 (App. Div. 2007).
The declaratory judgment actions were
filed in response to the New Jersey Supreme
Court's 2015 decision that declared
the Council on Affordable Housing
("COAH") defunct and reinstated the
courts as "the forum of first instance for
evaluating municipal compliance with
<EMU>Mount Laurel</EMU>." <EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU>, 221 N.J.
at 20, 110 A.3d 31. In 1985, the New
Jersey Legislature adopted the Fair Housing
Act ("FHA"), N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 to -329,
and created COAH to oversee municipal
efforts to satisfy their constitutionally
mandated affordable housing obligations.
But, having concluded that COAH was
"not capable of functioning as intended by
the FHA" when the agency failed to enact
judicially acceptable Third Round rules after
being given multiple extensions of time,
the Supreme Court directed trial courts to
both establish affordable housing obligations
for New Jersey's municipalities
and certify municipal plans to meet those
obligations through declaratory judgment
actions. <EMU>Mount</EMU>
<SPage 90>
<EMU>Laurel IV</EMU>, 221 N.J. at 24-29,
110 A.3d 31. In the more than two and
a half years following the filing of the
Mercer County declaratory judgment actions,
three small municipalities dismissed
their complaints, citing the expense of the
litigation; six have entered settlements
with Fair Share Housing Center ("FSHC")
that are moving through the compliance
process, seeking judicial approval of their
Housing Elements and Fair Share Plans;
and two &mdash; Princeton and West Windsor &mdash;
remain litigants in the proceedings to establish
a fair share methodology, which is
the subject of this decision.

<P20>In <EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU>, 221 N.J. at 3-4, 110
A.3d 31, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its
commitment to ensuring that New Jersey's
municipalities create a "realistic opportunity"
for producing their fair shares of the
regional Present and Prospective Need for
low and moderate income ("LMI") housing.
Recognizing COAH's failure to address
the constitutional obligation administratively,
the Court directed the trial
courts to follow "as closely as possible the
FHA's processes," <EMU>id.</EMU> at 6, 110 A.3d 31, as
implemented by COAH in determining
municipal fair share obligations and reviewing
the municipal zoning ordinances
proposed to achieve constitutional compliance
with those obligations. Notably, the
Supreme Court directed the trial courts
"not to become a replacement agency for
COAH," nor to become "an alternate form
of statewide administrative decision maker
for unresolved policy details" that remained
following COAH's inability to
adopt regulations governing the Third
Round. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 29, 110 A.3d 31. Rather, the
trial courts were directed to utilize previous
methodologies developed in the First
and Second Round rules by COAH to "establish
present and prospective statewide
and regional affordable housing need." <EMU>Id.</EMU>
at 30, 110 A.3d 31.

<P20>The determination of municipal affordable
housing obligations requires trial
courts to once again delve into the technical
complexities involved in developing a
methodology to calculate numerical affordable
housing needs, bringing to mind the
first such effort in <EMU>AMG Realty Co. v.
Township of Warren</EMU>, 207 N.J. Super. 388,
<SPage 91>
504 A.2d 692 (Law Div. 1984) ("<EMU>AMG</EMU>").
After recognizing that the development of
a methodology to allocate fair share obligations
to municipalities was the "primary
step" in achieving the ultimate goal of
providing more affordable housing in New
Jersey and satisfying the constitutional
mandate imposed by the <EMU>Mount Laurel</EMU>
doctrine, the <EMU>AMG</EMU> court went on to detail
the intricate steps it endorsed in establishing
a numerical fair share obligation for
Warren Township. Its consideration of
population projection models, employment
<Page 517>
factors, and computation of median incomes
addressed issues that remain subjects
of dispute today, more than thirty
years later, and even after COAH developed
its own methodologies in the First
and Second Rounds pursuant to the FHA,
and made three attempts to enact Third
Round rules that complied with the <EMU>Mount
Laurel</EMU> doctrine. Indeed, the <EMU>AMG</EMU> court's
observation that, "[t]he pivotal question is
not whether the numbers are too high or
low, but whether the methodology that
produces the numbers is reasonable," <EMU>id.</EMU> at
453, 504 A.2d 692, remains as apt today as
it was in 1984. And the challenge facing
this court is the same one confronting the
<EMU>AMG</EMU> court: "to make the subject matter
easily intelligible while at the same time
not sacrificing accuracy and thoroughness."
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 450, 504 A.2d 692. In assuming
this challenge, the court is cognizant
that the endeavor "involves highly controversial
economic, sociological and policy
questions of innate difficulty and complexity."
<EMU>Oakwood at Madison, Inc. v. Township
of Madison</EMU>, 72 N.J. 481, 533, 371 A.2d 1192
(1977). In fact, "providing suitable and affordable
housing for citizens of low and
moderate incomes" remains "one of the
most difficult constitutional, legal and social
issues of our day." <EMU>In re Adoption of
N.J.A.C. 5:94 & 5:95</EMU>, 390 N.J. Super. at 31,
914 A.2d 348. If anything, the passage of
time since the establishment of the <EMU>Mount
Laurel</EMU> doctrine has done little to lessen
the controversy, as COAH's three attempts
to adopt satisfactory Third Round
rules and the ensuing litigation leading to
this proceeding demonstrate.

<P20>Finally, as the Supreme Court pointed
out in <EMU>S. Burlington County NAACP v.
Township of Mount Laurel</EMU>, 92 N.J. 158,
456 A.2d 390 (1983) ("<EMU>Mount Laurel II</EMU>"),
and as has been confirmed in
<SPage 92>
this case,
fair share determinations are the most
time-consuming and difficult part of <EMU>Mount
Laurel</EMU> litigation:

<B22>The most troublesome issue in <EMU>Mount
Laurel</EMU> litigation is the determination of
fair share. It takes the most time, produces
the greatest variety of opinions,
and engenders doubt as to the meaning
and wisdom of <EMU>Mount Laurel</EMU>. Determination
of fair share has required resolution
of three separate issues: identifying
the relevant region, determining the
present and prospective housing needs,
and allocating those needs to the municipality
or municipalities involved. Each of
these issues produces a morass of facts,
statistics, projections, theories and opinions
sufficient to discourage even the
staunchest supporters of <EMU>Mount Laurel</EMU>.
The problem is capable of monopolizing
counsel's time for years, overwhelming
trial courts and inundating reviewing
courts with a record on review of superhuman
dimensions.

<B22>[92 N.J. at 248, 456 A.2d 390.]

<P00>Notably, the Supreme Court also recognized
that the "tools for calculating present
and prospective need and its allocation
are imprecise." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 257, 456 A.2d 390.
That imprecision did not deter the Court
from directing the trial courts to determine
actual numerical obligations for municipalities
to satisfy, "not because we
think scientific accuracy is possible, but
because we believe the requirement is
most likely to achieve the goals of <EMU>Mount
Laurel</EMU>." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>The truth of those observations has certainly
been borne out in the present proceeding,
which consumed more than forty
trial days and produced a record containing
approximately 300 exhibits. The court
reviewed innumerable charts, years of demographic
data, and conflicting statistical
analyses. The court also listened carefully
to testimony from six expert witnesses,
two of whom testified for more than twelve
days each. Given the importance of the
<Page 518>
endeavor, however, the court placed very
few limitations on the presentation of testimony
and evidence in order to allow the
parties to compile as complete a record as
possible for judicial review. This decision
examines that record and, with acknowledged
imprecision, but a commitment to
achieving reasonable results, adopts a fair
share methodology and numerical obligations
to guide Princeton and West Windsor
in satisfying their constitutional responsibility
to provide affordable housing.
<SPage 93>

<CN>II. Factual and Procedural History

<P20>In <EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU>, 221 N.J. at 34, 110
A.3d 31, the Supreme Court not only recognized
that the administrative process established
in the FHA had become non-functioning,
but explicitly directed municipalities
to return to the courts to obtain
judgments of compliance with their constitutional
obligations to provide affordable
housing, as had been the case prior to
adoption of the FHA and the creation of
COAH. Acknowledging that a return to
the courts would involve some disruption
from the administrative process that the
towns had followed previously, the Court
established a transition period of ninety
days, after which eleven of the twelve
Mercer County municipalities filed declaratory
judgment actions in the summer of
2015 seeking to obtain approval of their
Housing Elements and Fair Share Plans.
This court appointed a special compliance
master for each town to review their proposed
Housing Elements and make recommendations
to the court as to whether the
municipal Plans passed muster in terms of
providing a realistic opportunity for the
creation of LMI housing.

<P20>However, since COAH had not adopted
Third Round rules to establish the methodology
for determining the numerical fair
share obligation for each town, that task
fell to the trial courts. This court consolidated
all of the Mercer County declaratory
judgment actions for the sole purpose of
determining that methodology. Each town
would then be treated separately for compliance
purposes once a methodology was
established. Knowing that determination of
a methodology to ascertain numerical affordable
housing need presented highly
complex and technical issues, the court
retained a Special "Methodology" Master
in cooperation with the <EMU>Mount Laurel</EMU>
judges in Ocean and Monmouth Counties
&mdash;the two other Counties making up
Region 4 under prior COAH practice. That
Special Master is economic consultant
Richard Reading, who assisted the court
throughout the proceedings by reviewing
expert reports, making recommendations
to the court regarding the many aspects of
the methodology where the experts differed,
and testifying at the trial. Mr. Reading
provided invaluable
<SPage 94>
assistance to the
court in evaluating the distinctly different
methodologies proffered by both sides to
determine municipal fair share obligations.
Upon the court's completion of its fair
share model, the court provided the results
to Mr. Reading for him to calculate the
statewide, regional, and municipal obligations
that are set forth in this decision.

<P20>Likely anticipating that the courts would
be put in the position of determining a fair
share methodology due to COAH's inaction,
Fair Share Housing Center, an established
affordable housing advocacy group
and a litigant in many affordable housing
cases arising under the <EMU>Mount Laurel</EMU> doctrine,
produced a report in April 2015 presenting
a methodology to determine LMI
housing obligations in New Jersey for the
period 1999-2025, which it offered as an
alternative to COAH's un-adopted Third
Round rules. In June of 2015, a group of
municipalities entered into a shared services
agreement with Rutgers University
to produce a fair share affordable housing
methodology and report of their own, but
<Page 519>
that report was delayed until December
30, 2015, after Econsult Solutions, Inc.
("Econsult"), replaced Rutgers University
as the towns' consultant due to the unexpected
incapacity of Rutgers professor, Dr.
Robert Burchell, who had been a long-time
COAH consultant and lead analyst under
the Rutgers agreement.

<P20>Pursuant to the Supreme Court's <EMU>Mount
Laurel IV</EMU> directive, eleven of the twelve
Mercer County municipalities filed declaratory
judgment actions in the summer of
2015 in Mercer County Superior Court:
Hamilton, East Windsor, West Windsor,
Lawrence, Robbinsville, Princeton, Pennington,
Ewing, Hightstown, Hopewell
Township, and Hopewell Borough. The
Mercer municipalities were joined by several
intervenors: FSHC, New Jersey
Builders Association ("NJBA"), OTR East
Windsor Investors, LLC, Thompson Realty
Company of Princeton, Inc., CF Hopewell,
LLC, Howard Hughes Corp., The
Blackpoint Group, LLC, and Avalon
Watch, LLC. Several additional developers
joined as intervenors during the course of
these proceedings, and others identified
themselves as interested parties. The only
Mercer County
<SPage 95>
municipality that did not
file a declaratory judgment action was the
City of Trenton, a Qualified Urban Aid
Municipality or "QUAM" that is not required
to satisfy a Prospective Need new
construction obligation under COAH practice.

<P20>On September 25, 2015, this court consolidated
the Mercer County declaratory
judgment actions for ultimate disposition
as to methodology only, and the court
granted and extended temporary, full immunity
from <EMU>Mount Laurel</EMU> litigation to the
towns. That immunity has been extended
throughout the duration of these proceedings.
In the same order, the court appointed
Mr. Reading as Special Methodology
Master.

<P20>While this court awaited the completion
and submission of the municipalities' affordable
housing methodology report, it
invited the parties to provide briefing on
issues relating to compliance rather than
methodology that they considered legal in
nature and that could conceivably be determined
without a trial. The subsequent
briefing and argument demonstrated to
the court that very few of the issues could
be determined without further proceedings
because most of the issues were too intertwined
with the methodology for calculating
municipal obligations to be decided
without a full record. Consequently, the
decision issued by the court on November
19, 2015, addressed only the issue of bonus
credits. The court held that Mercer County
municipalities could choose either the
Second Round or Third Round framework
regarding bonus credits (excluding any
Third Round bonus credit rule specifically
invalidated by the Appellate Division, such
as the compliance bonus), but could not
combine credit mechanisms from both
Rounds.

<P20>On December 18, 2015, the court ordered
a trial on the methodology and calculation
of state, regional, and municipal
affordable housing need allocation ("methodology
trial"), targeting April of 2016 as
the likely starting date. In preparation for
the methodology trial, the court directed
the parties to submit, exchange, and comment
on each other's affordable housing
obligation reports, which were reviewed
and analyzed by Special Methodology Master
<SPage 96>
Reading. The court also authorized
depositions of experts, including Mr. Reading.

<P20>Meanwhile, proceedings were occurring
simultaneously throughout the State. In
Region 4, the Honorable Mark Troncone,
J.S.C., had directed briefing and argument
on the time frame to include in the calculation
of affordable housing obligations.
<Page 520>
While COAH had originally developed regulations
projecting need for six-year intervals,
later extended to ten-year intervals, a
total of sixteen years had passed without
effective Third Round rules by the time
the Supreme Court returned the process
to the trial courts. While it was clear that a
methodology had to be developed for the
ten-year Prospective Need period of 2015
to 2025, a dispute arose as to how to treat
the years from 1999 to 2015, during which
time COAH had been unable to adopt a
Third Round regulatory scheme acceptable
to the courts. This period became known
as the "gap" period.

<P20>In a decision issued on February 18,
2016, Judge Troncone decided that the
methodology to determine municipal affordable
housing obligations had to include
a "separate and distinct component" to
address the need that arose during the gap
period. As noted by the Supreme Court in
<EMU>In re Declaratory Judgment Actions Filed
By Various Municipalities, County of
Ocean</EMU>, Judge Troncone "reasoned that the
need arising from 1999 to 2015 could be
calculated not by using projections into the
future, as is typical of prospective need,
but by relying on the actual growth that
accumulated during that time period." 227
N.J. 508, 518-19, 152 A.3d 915 (2017)
("<EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>"). On March 15, 2016,
this court adopted Judge Troncone's decision
for the Mercer County declaratory
judgment actions and instructed the parties
in this proceeding to include the sixteen-year
gap period in the methodologies
they would be submitting to the court for
review. Given this added responsibility, the
court adjourned the trial until September
2016 to allow the parties to prepare reports
addressing gap need.

<P20>On July 11, 2016, the Appellate Division
reversed the Ocean County decision to include
a separate and discrete calculation of
need for the gap period, although the appellate
court noted that
<SPage 97>
the housing need
that arose over the sixteen-year gap period
could be included in Present Need. <EMU>In re
Declaratory Judgment Actions Filed by
Various Muns., Cnty. of Ocean</EMU>, 446 N.J.
Super. 259, 141 A.3d 359 (App. Div. 2016).
The Supreme Court subsequently granted
certification to review the determination.
227 N.J. 355, 151 A.3d 964 (2016).

<P20>Shortly thereafter, on July 21, 2016, the
Honorable Douglas Wolfson, J.S.C., now
retired, decided <EMU>In re Township of South
Brunswick</EMU>, 448 N.J. Super. 441, 153 A.3d
981 (Law Div. 2016). That decision adopted
a methodology to calculate a fair share
obligation for South Brunswick following
an eight-day trial. Judge Wolfson endorsed
the methodology proffered by FSHC and
its expert, Dr. David Kinsey, except that
he did not incorporate the filtering adjustment
calculated by Dr. Kinsey, agreeing
with the recommendation of former COAH
Executive Director Art Bernard. Judge
Wolfson reviewed the two competing
methodologies without assistance from a
court-appointed expert.

<P20>In order not to delay further the proceedings
in this matter due to Supreme
Court review of issues pertaining to the
gap period, this court directed that the gap
period obligation, if any, be considered
separately from the rest of the Third
Round methodology pending release of a
decision on the gap period from the Supreme
Court. This court then directed that
the trial on Third Round Need for the
Mercer municipalities would begin in January
2017. Of the eleven consolidated Mercer
County municipalities, Hightstown,
Hopewell Borough, and Pennington had
dismissed their declaratory judgment actions,
while Hamilton, Ewing, and Robbinsville
had settled with FSHC. That left
East Windsor, West Windsor, Lawrence,
Princeton, and Hopewell Township to participate
in the consolidated methodology
<Page 521>
trial. As the trial progressed, however, all
of the towns except for Princeton and
West Windsor entered settlements with
FSHC and are proceeding through the
compliance process. This decision, therefore,
will focus on the fair share obligations
of Princeton and West Windsor.

<P20>Over forty trial days addressing both
the Prospective Need and Gap Present
Need methodologies, and extending from
January
<SPage 98>
until June 2017, the court heard
testimony from Peter Angelides, Ph.D.,
A.I.C.P. ("Dr. Angelides"), of Econsult and
Robert S. Powell Jr., Ph.D. ("Dr. Powell"),
on behalf of Princeton, West Windsor, and
the New Jersey League of Municipalities
("League of Municipalities"); David N.
Kinsey, Ph.D., F.A.I.C.P, P.P. ("Dr. Kinsey"),
and Daniel T. McCue ("Mr.
McCue"), on behalf of FSHC; and Art
Bernard, P.P. ("Mr. Bernard"), and Jeffrey
Otteau ("Mr. Otteau") on behalf of
NJBA. Notably, on January 17, 2017, the
court denied a motion in limine filed by
NJBA to exclude Dr. Powell's expert testimony.
NJBA asserted that since Dr. Powell's
reports addressed the housing market
and not any step of the fair share methodology,
his testimony should be barred as
irrelevant. The court disagreed, determining
that Dr. Powell's testimony could be
relevant to provide context for certain
methodology issues that would be addressed
in the trial. The court further
determined that Dr. Powell's testimony
might be helpful in evaluating aspects of
the methodology, including choices of datasets,
and could shed light on the likelihood
that any methodology chosen would result
in the production of affordable housing. As
a result, NJBA offered testimony from Mr.
Jeffrey Otteau, another housing expert, to
rebut the housing market analysis presented
by Dr. Powell. In addition, Dr. Kinsey
addressed Dr. Powell's testimony as well.

<P20>On January 18, 2017, the Supreme Court
affirmed but modified the Appellate Division
decision regarding gap need, requiring
a calculation in the Third Round to
determine a gap period obligation as part
of Present Need ("Gap Present Need"). As
a result of this decision, this court issued
an order on January 31, 2017, adding an
Expanded Present Need or Gap phase to
the methodology trial to follow the conclusion
of the "Prospective Need" phase, already
in progress.

<HN00>A. Parties' Positions

<P20>The overarching theme of the case presented
by Princeton, West Windsor, and
the League of Municipalities was that any
<SPage 99>
methodology adopted by the court needed
to be based upon development "reasonably
likely to occur" by 2025, pursuant to
the FHA. And since it was their position
that the housing market could not absorb
the number of units endorsed by FSHC
based on the methodology developed by
Dr. Kinsey, they consistently advocated for
use of data and methodological steps that
would result in much lower obligations.
While Dr. Angelides, the municipalities'
expert from Econsult, followed the general
outline developed by COAH in prior
rounds, he deviated from COAH practice
when he determined that superior approaches
or datasets were available or, in
his opinion, more consistent with the FHA.

<P20>On the other hand, FSHC's theme was
adherence as much as possible to past
COAH practice, especially to the model
developed in the Second Round. Where
that was not possible due to changes in
data availability, Dr. Kinsey proposed approaches
that he claimed were close to
COAH practice or consistent with principles
endorsed by COAH in the past. The
NJBA, relying on their primary expert,
Mr. Art Bernard, former Executive Director
of COAH, generally supported Dr.
<Page 522>
Kinsey's model, with a few notable variations,
the most prominent being Mr. Bernard's
rejection of Dr. Kinsey's filtering
model as a secondary source adjustment.

<P20>Mr. Reading reviewed all of the expert
reports and attended the entire trial, making
recommendations to the court in his
reports and through his testimony as to
which steps of each party expert to endorse.
He was the only neutral party to
participate in the proceedings, characterizing
his role as advisor to the court. While
the court, in retrospect, would have likely
benefitted from consideration of a third
model produced by a neutral expert without
the strong views of the parties in this
case, Mr. Reading nonetheless provided an
objective expert analysis to help the court
understand the technical presentations and
select the most appropriate steps from
each expert to include in the court's methodology.
As will be seen in the lengthy
discussion that follows, the court reviewed
each step of the methodology and then
endorsed one approach for each step, often
&mdash;but not always&mdash;accepting the recommendations
<SPage 100>
of Mr. Reading. The court
struggled to be consistent in its approach
in adopting Prospective Need and Gap
Need methodologies, and combined approaches
from the experts with some trepidation
as to whether the mixing of elements
from each model would produce a
coherent methodology without unforeseen
negative impacts. In choosing an approach
for each step, the court evaluated the credibility
of the experts and the reasonableness
of the datasets and methods advocated
by both sides. The strong advocacy of
the experts to support either higher
(FSHC) or lower (municipalities) obligations
caused the court to approach all
party recommendations with healthy skepticism
and some dismay when their models
resulted in vastly divergent calculations of
need. While Mr. Reading's recommendations
had the benefit of objectivity, and he
freely selected between the alternatives
advocated by each expert, the court evaluated
his positions against the record and
occasionally selected a different option that
the court found more convincing. Prior to
examining the steps to incorporate into the
court's fair share methodology, the court
will briefly review the backgrounds of the
experts who testified and the nature of
their testimony.

<HN00>B. The Experts

<HN24>1. Dr. Peter Angelides &mdash; Offered by
the Municipalities

<P20>Dr. Angelides earned his undergraduate
degree in Urban Studies with a minor in
Mathematics from the University of Pennsylvania
in 1987, continuing on to earn his
Master's Degree in City Planning the following
year. Dr. Angelides completed a
Master's Degree and then a Ph.D. in Economics
in June of 1997 from the University
of Minnesota. His areas of expertise are
statistics, economic modeling, and development
planning. Dr. Angelides' experience
included providing financial and strategic
advice for public and private entities in the
areas of economic development, transportation,
real estate, and public policy. Dr.
Angelides worked with COAH in 2008-2009
on the second iteration of the
<SPage 101>
Third
Round rules while employed by Econsult,
and has performed other work in New
Jersey related to affordable housing.

<P20>Dr. Angelides' approach to developing
the fair share affordable housing methodology
followed what was described in the
municipalities' brief as the "essential principles"
established by the Supreme Court
to guide trial courts in determining the
obligation for each town to meet the constitutional
requirements of <EMU>Mount Laurel
I</EMU>. First, that courts should defer to the will
of the New Jersey Legislature as expressed
in the FHA, which directed the
<Page 523>
"establishment of reasonable fair share
housing guidelines and standards," such
that calculation of Prospective Need must
be based upon "development and growth
which is reasonably likely to occur,"

<P20>Second, Dr. Angelides, citing <EMU>In re
Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 & 5:97</EMU>, 416 N.J.
Super. 462, 484, 6 A.3d 445 (App. Div.
2010), embraced the municipalities' view
that trial judges should use standards
"similar to," although not necessarily identical
to, the guidelines set forth in COAH's
First and Second Round rules to define
Present and Prospective Need. The municipalities
assert, however, citing <EMU>Mount
Laurel IV</EMU>, 221 N.J. at 30, 110 A.3d 31, that
the First and Second Round standards are
to be used "as a framework&mdash;not a
straightjacket&mdash;to extrapolate Present and
Prospective Need."

<P20>Third, the municipalities argue that the
Supreme Court did not strictly prohibit
trial judges from making methodological
decisions that may qualify as "policy judgments,"
but instead urged them to exercise
caution when making decisions inconsistent
with the Prior Rounds. And finally,
the municipalities stressed the universal
acceptance among the experts and the Appellate
Division of the importance of using
the best, most up-to-date data in determining
the appropriate fair share methodology.
<EMU>See In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 &
5:97</EMU>, 416 N.J. Super. at 486-87, 6 A.3d 445.

<P20>Dr. Angelides cited these "essential
principles" as the source of his approach to
developing a fair share methodology. He
asserted that his model is based on, and
similar to, methods used in the
<SPage 102>
Prior
Rounds; is clear and transparent; utilizes
the most recent and appropriate data
available on a uniform statewide basis; follows
the FHA, court decisions, prior methods,
and available data; and results in "realistic"
municipal obligations reflecting
Present and Prospective Need as defined
in the FHA, and as explained in <EMU>Mount
Laurel IV</EMU>. Angelides Rpt. (May 16, 2016),
Exhibit ("Ex.") P2 at 6.

<HN24>2. Dr. David Kinsey &mdash; Offered by
FSHC

<P20>Dr. Kinsey received a Master's Degree
in Public Affairs and Urban Planning from
Princeton University, as well as a Ph.D. in
Public and International Affairs from that
same institution in 1975. Dr. Kinsey
worked in various positions at the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
("NJDEP") from 1975 to 1983, including
serving as the Director of
NJDEP's Planning Group, where he became
involved in affordable housing issues.
After leaving NJDEP, Dr. Kinsey's private
sector work has included developing Fair
Share methodologies and compliance
mechanisms, drafting Fair Share plans,
and advising private and public sector entities
on affordable housing throughout the
State. He identified himself as a housing
advocate with a long association with
FSHC. He has been involved in many
different facets of affordable housing need,
compliance, and production in New Jersey
for more than three decades. Dr. Kinsey
described the principles that guided the
preparation of his methodology as close
adherence to COAH's Prior Round methodologies,
use of the "most up-to-date
available data," transparency, accessibility
to understanding his methodology's components,
and consistency in the time periods
and datasets he used.

<P20>FSHC and Dr. Kinsey's approach to developing
the fair share affordable housing
methodology was based on an interpretation
of Supreme Court guidance requiring
trial courts to apply COAH Prior Round
methodologies with minimal discretion limited
primarily to selecting data to utilize in
the calculations of fair share housing obligations.
FSHC cited language from <EMU>Mount</EMU>
<Page 524>
<EMU>Laurel IV</EMU>,
<SPage 103>
221 N.J. at 30, 110 A.3d 31,
to argue that the Supreme Court did not
sanction any deviations from COAH's First
and Second Round rules, stating that the
methodologies employed in those rounds
"should be used to establish present and
prospective statewide and regional affordable
housing need. The parties should demonstrate
to the court computations of housing
need and municipal obligations based
on those methodologies." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> FSHC dismissed
notions that trial courts retained
discretion to determine a methodology beyond
the selection of currently relevant
data, contending instead that the Supreme
Court reserved such "discretion" or "flexibility"
for the municipal compliance stage,
which would follow the establishment of a
methodology and be addressed separately
in each Mercer County town that had not
settled with FSHC. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 30, 33, 110 A.3d
31.

<P20>According to FSHC, the Supreme Court
prohibited trial courts from reconciling
policy debates, contending that selecting
deviations from COAH's established approaches
would disrupt the comprehensive
and considered balancing of policy objectives
performed by COAH in the prior
Rounds. Dr. Kinsey interpreted the Appellate
Division's 2010 directive that trial
courts utilize "the most up-to-date available
data," to mean the "best data," which
was not necessarily the most recent, but
the most reliable. Kinsey Rpt. (May 17,
2016), Ex. DF at 10.

<HN24>3. Mr. Daniel McCue &mdash; Offered by
FSHC

<P20>Mr. McCue is a graduate of Williams
College and holds a Master's Degree in
Urban Planning from the Harvard University
Graduate School of Design. Mr.
McCue is currently a senior research associate
at the Harvard University Joint
Center for Housing Studies. Mr. McCue's
research has included demographics,
homeownership and rental market trends,
affordable housing policies and programs,
and mortgage markets. Mr. McCue is
principally responsible for the Joint Center's
annual "State of the Nation's Housing"
report and created the Center's latest
household growth projections, which
formed the basis for his expert
<SPage 104>
testimony. He was offered as an expert
by FSHC to discuss headship rates, which
essentially are used to project the size of
households by number of occupants. Mr.
McCue supported the manner in which
Dr. Kinsey utilized headship rates to determine
the number of LMI households in
New Jersey in 2025, offered an alternative
approach, and criticized the way in which
Dr. Angelides utilized headship rates in
the Econsult model.

<HN24>4. Mr. Art Bernard, P.P. &mdash; Offered by
NJBA

<P20>Mr. Bernard received a Master's Degree
in City and Regional Planning from Rutgers
University, and is a licensed professional
planner in the State of New Jersey.
Mr. Bernard worked previously as Deputy
Director and later Executive Director of
COAH, where he participated in the development,
drafting, and implementation of
the First and Second Round rules. After
leaving COAH, Mr. Bernard has served as
a consultant for many municipalities. He
also has acted as a court-appointed special
master in several affordable housing cases.
Mr. Bernard has advised clients in both
the public and private sectors on affordable
housing issues. Given his qualifications
and experience working with the First and
Second Round rules, Mr. Bernard was permitted
to offer testimony on affordable
housing issues generally as well as the
rulemaking process followed by COAH in
the First and Second Rounds.
<Page 525>

<P20>Mr. Bernard endorsed Dr. Kinsey's
model with a few variations, choosing it
instead of the approach offered by Dr.
Angelides because the Kinsey model adhered
more closely to prior COAH practice.
He also criticized a number of the
approaches recommended by Dr. Angelides
as efforts to use the court as a forum
to decide unresolved policy issues that are
better left to an administrative agency.
Notably, Mr. Bernard supported his rejection
of the Econsult/Angelides model by
noting that where the Second Round produced
a total of seventy-one municipalities
with no affordable housing obligations
statewide, of which forty-seven were urban
aid municipalities that were expressly exempt,
Dr. Angelides' methodology, by contrast,
yielded 240 municipalities
<SPage 105>
with no
obligation, irrespective of the fact that
these municipalities were responsible for
about one-third of the approximate 85,000-unit
statewide obligation in the Second
Round.

<HN24>5. Dr. Robert S. Powell, Jr. &mdash; Offered
by New Jersey League of Municipalities

<P20>Dr. Robert Powell received a Master's
Degree and Ph.D. in Public Affairs from
Princeton University. He currently works
as a managing director for Nassau Capital
Advisors in Princeton, New Jersey, which
provides financial advisory and consulting
services for real estate development projects.
Dr. Powell has advised a variety of
public and private clients on issues involving
the feasibility and financial structure of
real estate projects, including affordable
housing. Dr. Powell submitted reports, accepted
into evidence, which addressed use
of the inclusionary zoning strategy to satisfy
the fair share obligations advocated by
the parties in this case.

<P20>Dr. Powell discussed the effectiveness
and limitations of "the inclusionary zoning
strategy" as a tool to provide affordable
housing through 2025, the end of the Prospective
Need period, focusing specifically
on demographic and economic constraints.
Powell Rpt. (March 30, 2016), Ex. P 24, at
2-3. Dr. Powell testified that the FHA does
not require municipalities to spend revenue
to provide affordable housing, so that
many towns turn to inclusionary zoning to
satisfy their fair share obligations. That
strategy relies primarily on private capital
as opposed to public subsidies. He testified
that inclusionary zoning is organized
around a bargain with private developers
whereby municipalities relax zoning constraints
to provide for additional density of
market-rate units in return for developers
providing LMI units, which essentially are
subsidized by the increased number of
market-rate units. Typically, a certain percentage
of total units in a development will
be set aside for LMI housing, with the
remaining units leased or sold at market
rates. Dr. Powell explained that the strategy
assumes that there is significant demand
for new market rate housing that
<SPage 106>
cannot be satisfied by current zoning,
and thus is largely dependent upon the
ability of the New Jersey economy to support
the production of market-based housing
in quantities sufficient to subsidize the
desired number of affordable units.

<P20>After reviewing historic trends in the
New Jersey housing market, along with
economic and demographic projections, Dr.
Powell concluded that inclusionary zoning
will be unlikely to satisfy the affordable
housing obligations advocated by the parties
in this case. He singled out the obligations
sought to be imposed by FSHC as
particularly unrealistic. His assessment
was based upon several factors: (1) a recent
shift in new housing development
away from rural and suburban areas and
back to urban areas that do not receive
Prospective Need obligations; (2) the regulatory
definition of LMI that includes extremely
<Page 526>
poor households that are unable to
afford low-income units produced by private
developers; and (3) his conclusion
that, given recent economic and population
forecasts, there is no reason to expect that
there will be sufficient growth or development
in New Jersey between now and
2025 to produce more than a small fraction
of the need for affordable housing expected
to result from this proceeding. Powell
Rpt. (March 30, 2016), Ex. P 24 at 5.

<HN24>6. Mr. Jeffrey G. Otteau &mdash; Offered by
NJBA

<P20>The NJBA offered Mr. Otteau as an
expert in the housing market to rebut the
testimony of Dr. Powell. Mr. Otteau is a
licensed real estate appraiser and licensed
real estate broker who has worked in the
field since 1973. Mr. Otteau founded and
continues to work for The Otteau Group, a
real estate advisory and evaluation firm in
New Jersey that focuses on three key
areas: market analysis, property valuation,
and advisory services.

<P20>Mr. Otteau contended that Dr. Powell's
real estate market forecast through 2025
was unduly pessimistic because it was
based on data from years that included the
time during and shortly after the Great
Recession, which caused extraordinary disruption
to the economy and the housing
market. He also asserted that the slow
<SPage 107>
post-recession economic recovery in
New Jersey has recently accelerated, and
that he expects the housing market to
similarly rebound, getting stronger
through 2025. In fact, Mr. Otteau opined
that housing construction demand will rapidly
exceed recent averages in the next few
years, far outstripping the projections for
new construction made by Dr. Powell.

<CN>III. Fair Share Legal Standard

<P20>The <EMU>Mount Laurel</EMU> doctrine recognizes
that a municipality's "power to zone
carries a constitutional obligation to do so
in a manner that creates a realistic opportunity
for producing a fair share of the
regional present and prospective need for
housing low- and moderate-income families."
<EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU>, 221 N.J. at 3-4, 110
A.3d 31 (citing <EMU>Mount Laurel I</EMU>, 67 N.J. at
151, 336 A.2d 713; and <EMU>Mount Laurel II</EMU>, 92
N.J. at 158, 456 A.2d 390). The Supreme
Court's opinion in <EMU>Mount Laurel II</EMU> provided
the basic framework for establishing
whether a municipality has met its <EMU>Mount
Laurel</EMU> obligations. <EMU>See Mount Laurel II</EMU>,
92 N.J. at 158-221, 456 A.2d 390. The
Court directed that municipalities must
first establish their housing need by calculating
a concrete number of housing units,
<EMU>id.</EMU> at 215-16, 456 A.2d 390, and then create
housing plans that provide a "realistic opportunity"
to meet that housing need, <EMU>id.</EMU>
at 221, 456 A.2d 390.

<P20>The Legislature endorsed these objectives
when it created an administrative
mechanism for enforcing affordable housing
requirements through the FHA and
the State Planning Act. N.J.S.A. 52:18A-196
to -207. Through the FHA, COAH was
specifically tasked with promulgating periodic
rules to guide municipalities in both
ascertaining their fair share housing obligations
and in developing appropriate compliance
plans to meet those obligations.

<P20>COAH successfully carried out its mandate
twice. The First Round Rules in 1986,
N.J.A.C. 5:92-1.1 to -18.20, covered housing
obligations from 1987 to 1993, while
the Second Round Rules in 1994, N.J.A.C.
5:93-1.1 to -15.1, covered housing obligations
accrued from 1987 through 1999.
While these Rules largely withstood the
various legal challenges leveled against
them, the Third
<SPage 108>
Round Rules failed on
two separate occasions to secure full judicial
approval. <EMU>See In re Adoption of
N.J.A.C. 5:94 & 5:95</EMU>, 390 N.J. Super. at
86-87, 914 A.2d 348 (overturning the first
<Page 527>
iteration, codified at N.J.A.C. 5:94-1.1 to -9.2);
<EMU>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96</EMU>, 215
N.J. 578, 74 A.3d 893 (2013) (overturning
the second iteration, codified at N.J.A.C.
5:96-1.1 to -20.4). When COAH failed to
comply with the Supreme Court's directive
to promulgate lawful Third Round Rules,
leaving a sixteen-year regulatory gap, the
Supreme Court removed COAH from its
role and restored the courts as the primary
enforcement instrument for affordable
housing obligations. <EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU>,
221 N.J. at 19-20, 110 A.3d 31. Notably,
although COAH proposed a third iteration
of the Third Round Rules ("Round 3.3"),
the Council deadlocked in voting upon the
proposals in 2014, leaving them unadopted.

<P20>In returning responsibility for the
<EMU>Mount Laurel</EMU> doctrine to the courts, as
noted above, the Supreme Court cautioned
that the "judicial role ... is not to become
a replacement agency for COAH," and eschewed
creating "an alternate form of
statewide administrative decision maker
for unresolved policy details of replacement
Third Round Rules." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 29, 110
A.3d 31. The Court recognized the Legislature's
preference for an administrative
remedy over litigation and instructed the
courts to "track the processes provided for
in the FHA," in order to "facilitate a return
to a system of coordinated administrative
and court actions in the event
COAH eventually promulgates constitutional
Third Round Rules." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 29, 34,
110 A.3d 31. The Supreme Court specifically
directed judges charged with ascertaining
municipal affordable housing obligations
to use methodologies set forth in
COAH's First and Second Round Rules,
while allowing them to seek guidance from
the aspects of COAH's Third Round rules
not invalidated by the appellate courts. <EMU>Id.</EMU>
at 30, 33, 110 A.3d 31. While seemingly
straightforward, this guidance was not always
easy to follow as the court reviewed
the methodologies advocated by the experts.
<SPage 109>

<P20>The initial formula utilized by
COAH to calculate regional and municipal
fair share need was patterned to some
extent on the trial court's opinion in <EMU>AMG</EMU>,
207 N.J. Super. at 397-456, 504 A.2d 692.
<EMU>See also Toll Bros. v. Township of West
Windsor</EMU>, 173 N.J. 502, 577, 803 A.2d 53
(2002). Therefore, Judge Serpentelli's
guiding principles in devising his fair share
methodology in <EMU>AMG</EMU> are instructive here:

<B22>Any reasonable methodology must have
as its keystone three ingredients: reliable
data, as few assumptions as possible,
and an internal system of checks
and balances. Reliable data refers to the
best source available for the information
needed and the rejection of data which
is suspect. The need to make as few
assumptions as possible refers to the
desirability of avoiding subjectivity and
avoiding any data which requires excessive
mathematical extrapolation. An internal
system of checks and balances
refers to the effort to include all important
concepts while not allowing any
concept to have a disproportionate impact.

<B22>[207 N.J. Super. at 453, 504 A.2d 692.]

<P20>With these principles in mind, the court
turns to the task of developing a fair share
methodology to govern the Third Round,
and to provide numerical obligations that
will guide Princeton and West Windsor in
satisfying their constitutional responsibility
to provide affordable housing through
2025.

<CN>IV. Fair Share Methodology

<P20>Municipal affordable housing obligations
are calculated from four primary components:
(1) Prior Round Obligations, if any;
(2) Present Need; (3) Third Round Prospective
Need from July 1, 2015 to June
30, 2025; and (4) Expanded Present Need
<Page 528>
from the gap period of July 1, 1999 to June
30, 2015. Because the methodology trial
began during the pendency of the gap
period appeals, the court bifurcated the
trial into two phases: the Prospective Need
Phase, which considered calculations of
Prior Round Need, Present Need, and
Prospective Need, and the Expanded
Present Need Phase that dealt with the
gap period. Among the challenges facing
the court in both phases was the passage
of time from the end of the Second Round
to the present, and the impact of both lags
in available datasets used by the experts
and the release of new data after expert
reports were filed.
<SPage 110>

<HN20>A. Prospective Need Phase Methodology

<P20>The first phase of the Mercer County
<EMU>Mount Laurel</EMU> methodology trial examined
the methodological steps used by COAH in
the First and Second Rounds, as directed
by the Supreme Court in <EMU>Mount Laurel
IV</EMU>. Drs. Kinsey and Angelides submitted
methodologies with steps that generally
followed those of COAH's approaches, but
with minor variations in ordering and nomenclature,
as well as the proposed addition
of some new steps by Dr. Angelides
and some modifications by Dr. Kinsey. For
purposes of this decision, the methodology
is organized into five broad steps by which
these experts (1) determined any municipal
Fair Share Obligations from Prior
Rounds; (2) calculated Present Need by
estimating the existing deficient housing
currently occupied by LMI households at
the municipal level; (3) calculated regional
Prospective Need by estimating the regional
growth of LMI households from
July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2025; (4)
allocated regional Prospective Need to the
municipalities; and (5) adjusted municipal
need, both up and down, based on anticipated
changes in affordable housing supply
due to secondary sources&mdash;demolitions,
conversions, and filtering&mdash;occurring in
the housing market. As will be demonstrated
in the following analysis, pursuant
to COAH's historic practice, Prior Obligations
and Present Need are determined
at the municipal level, whereas Prospective
Need starts at the county level, is aggregated
to the six COAH regions, and then
ultimately is allocated to the municipalities.
Statewide need, which is included
here for illustrative purposes, is determined
by aggregating the obligations from
each of the six COAH regions.

<HN24>1. Determine Prior Round Obligations

<P20>A Prior Round Obligation is any
unfilled portion of municipal affordable
housing need assigned by COAH in Prior
Rounds. Dr. Angelides identified statewide
Prior Round Obligations of 85,853 affordable
housing units, the same as assigned in
the Second Round, which represents only a
minor deviation
<SPage 111>
from Dr. Kinsey's total
of 85,964, the same number published in
the second iteration of COAH's adopted
and partially invalidated Third Round
rules ("Round 3.2"). Drs. Angelides and
Kinsey reported identical Prior Round obligations
for Mercer County, as well as the
County's twelve municipalities, so there is
no dispute pertinent to the Mercer methodology
trial regarding this step in determining
fair share obligations. For aggregate
purposes, however, the court accepts
Dr. Kinsey's statewide number as representing
COAH's most recent determination
of Prior Round Obligations. In addition,
the number used by Dr. Kinsey was
specifically referenced by the Appellate
Division "as the prior round component of
the third round obligations ...." in <EMU>In Re
Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 & 5:97</EMU>, 416 N.J.
Super. at 500, 6 A.3d 445. The court thus
adopts the Prior Round Need set forth in
the following chart:

<HN24>2. Calculate Present Need

<P20>Present Need, also known as Indigenous
Need, was defined by COAH as the
"deficient housing units occupied by low
and moderate income households within a
municipality." It is calculated at the beginning
of the Prospective Need period and
capped for each town based on the proportion
of deficient housing stock in the region.
N.J.A.C. 5:93-1.3; N.J.A.C. 5:93-2.2.
Since there is no
<SPage 112>
direct measure of "deficient
housing units," COAH classified
units as deficient in the Second Round
utilizing seven selected surrogate measures
from the United States Census Bureau.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>; 26 N.J.R. 2345 (June 6, 1994)
(codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A). However,
that Census dataset became unavailable
and COAH in the Third Round retained
only three surrogates: (1) housing that was
over fifty years old and overcrowded; (2)
lacked complete plumbing; or (3) lacked
complete kitchen facilities. The Appellate
Division upheld this approach, which is
accepted by this court. <EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU>,
221 N.J. at 33, 110 A.3d 31 (citing <EMU>In re
Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:94 & 5:95</EMU>, 390 N.J.
Super. at 38-40, 914 A.2d 348).

<P20>Both Drs. Kinsey and Angelides estimated
municipal Present Need for two
points in time and performed straight-line
projections to the start of the Prospective
Need period in 2015. For both points in
time, each expert determined an estimate
of "unique" deficient housing units for each
municipality by identifying and accounting
for any overlap in units with deficiencies in
multiple surrogates, then multiplying that
count of unique deficient housing units by
the appropriate county's share of regional
LMI households to estimate Present Need
for each municipality. The key difference
in the methodologies was the cut-off date
for determining "old" housing units.

<P20>Both experts utilized American Community
Survey ("ACS") data in their calculations.
The ACS is an ongoing survey by
the United States Census Bureau that
gathers a wide range of demographic information
between the decennial censuses
and is released in one-year, and more detailed
five-year estimates. In this step, it
was necessary for Drs. Angelides and Kinsey
to utilize five-year ACS Public Use
Micro Sample ("PUMS") data, which is a
dataset that allows the cross-referencing of
multiple types of demographic information.
Angelides Rpt. (May 16, 2016), Ex. P2 at
19.

<P20>Dr. Angelides calculated the municipal
Present Need for 2000 and 2011 (mid-point
of the five-year, 2009-2013 ACS
PUMS dataset) to project Present Need to
2015. Dr. Angelides concluded that
<SPage 113>
it
was necessary to shift the cut-off date to
<Page 530>
accurately measure the number of deficient
housing units that actually existed in
each projection year, and thus considered
1950 and 1960 for 2000 and 2011, respectively,
as the cut-off dates to identify "old"
housing units.

<P20>Dr. Kinsey criticized Dr. Angelides' use
of two cut-off years because that approach
utilized two different pools of housing. Dr.
Kinsey calculated the municipal Present
Need for 2000 and 2012 (mid-point of the
five-year, 2010-2014 ACS PUMS dataset)
to project Present Need to 2015. Dr. Kinsey,
however, considered 1965, fifty years
prior to 2015, as the cut-off date to identify
"old" housing units for both projection
years, claiming that a fifty-year cut-off
ending in 2015, rather than cut-offs based
on 2000 and 2015, would be more accurate,
and would replicate COAH's approach in
the Second Round.

<B22>[Reading Rpt. (April 24, 2017), Ex. SM 1

<P20>Special Master Reading concluded
that Dr. Kinsey's use of a single cut-off
date in determining "old" housing units
was contrary to the new procedures for
determining housing deficiencies and undermined
the reliability of Dr. Kinsey's
estimates. The court agrees with Mr.
Reading's appraisal and adopts Dr. Angelides'
approach, concluding that it makes
more sense to determine if a housing unit
is "old" at the time it is being counted,
rather than if it will be "old" at a particular
time in the future. Notably, this calculation
of need was one of the only times
that Dr. Angelides recommended a higher
need number than Dr. Kinsey. Consequently,
the Present Need obligations
adopted by the court are reflected in the
following chart:

<HN24>3. Calculate Regional Prospective
Need

<P20>The FHA defines Prospective Need
as "a projection of housing needs based on
development and growth which is reasonably
likely to occur in a region or a municipality.
..." N.J.S.A. 52:27D-304(j). Prospective
Need is a number reflecting the
estimated incremental change in LMI
households within each region during the
Prospective Need period. Both Drs. Angelides
and Kinsey agreed on a Prospective
Need period from July 1, 2015, through
June 30, 2025, and accepted the six regions
<Page 531>
as delineated by COAH, with Mercer
County as part of Region 4, along with
Ocean and Monmouth Counties.

<P20>To determine regional Prospective
Need, the experts: (1) predicted the regional
population growth over the Prospective
Need period; (2) estimated the
proportion of that population living in
households; (3) estimated the number of
households associated with that population;
(4) estimated the growth of LMI
households during the Prospective Need
period; (5) removed households (primarily
senior citizens) with significant assets
from Prospective Need calculations (Dr.
Angelides only); and (6) calculated the regional
Prospective Need as the incremental
change between the estimate of LMI
households at the beginning and end of
the Prospective Need period.

<CN>a. Predict Population Growth

<P20>To estimate the incremental affordable
housing need over the ten-year
Prospective Need period first requires a
projection of population growth over that
period. This projection is a critical
<SPage 115>
starting point for the methodology because
it is a driver for the steps with the
greatest impact on need that follow. That
explains why there was extensive testimony
about population statistics and datasets
from the experts, and likely explains why
the parties diverged in their projections,
with the municipalities advocating for lower
population growth than FSHC during
the Prospective Need period.

<P20>Indeed, this first step in the Prospective
Need methodology vividly demonstrates
the complexities involved in just one step
of the model. As explained below, COAH
changed the datasets it used from the
First Round to the Second Round, used
various datasets in the three iterations of
the Third Round, and discovered that its
past projections had been either too low or
too high when the projection periods ended.
There was extensive demographic testimony
and evidence provided to the court,
including updated data that had not been
included in either model developed by the
experts, but was used to support particular
choices of datasets. To say the court had to
maneuver through a metaphorical minefield
to select a population projection for
the Third Round is not an understatement.
The experts did agree in testimony, however,
that making population estimates is
"fraught with uncertainty," "incredibly imprecise,"
and essentially a "risky business."
And the court had to undertake this
difficult task without testimony from any
expert demographer or clear guidance
from COAH, which&mdash;as noted above&mdash;had
used different datasets in the First and
Second Round rules and the various iterations
of the Third Round rules.

<P20>All of the experts admitted that COAH
relied primarily in the Prior Rounds upon
population projections from the New Jersey
Department of Labor (NJDOL) and its
successor, the New Jersey Department of
Labor and Workforce Development
(NJLWD). The First Round used only the
population estimates of the Historic Migration
Model (HMM), while the Second
Round averaged HMM estimates with
population projections from the Economic-Demographic
Model (EDM), and added a
further adjustment using the proprietary
Econometric Model from the Center for
Urban Policy
<SPage 116>
Research (CUPR) at Rutgers
University. <EMU>See</EMU> 26 N.J.R. 2347 (June
6, 1994). When COAH adopted its methodology
for the Second Round, both the
HMM and EDM projected population by
county and by age cohort. 26 N.J.R. 2347
(June 6, 1994) (codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93
app. A). At that time, both the EDM and
HMM projected similar total statewide
population, but differed in how they distributed
that population to the counties.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU> The HMM based population projections
<Page 532>
on past employment, over-projecting
to places of historic growth, while EDM's
projections were related to anticipated future
employment growth and distributed
population more evenly. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> In the Second
Round, COAH described the benefits
of averaging the two projections:

<B22>The averaged projection dampens the
distribution of [historic vs. future]
growth by allocating shares to central-city
counties as well as suburban and
rural counties. Each of the individual
models allocates growth too regularly in
one direction. The averaged projection
seems to be much more on target in
terms of the distributional realities of
growth.

<B22>[26 N.J.R. 2347 (June 6, 1994).]

<P20>In the years after the Second Round,
however, the NJDOL ceased providing
population projections below the state level
for the HMM. Then, in the adopted first
iteration of the Third Round rules ("Round
3.1"), COAH planned to average the EDM
projections with a second set of estimates
from the three Metropolitan Planning Organizations
(MPO) of the State, noting that
"both [the MPO and NJDOL] projections
generously state the growth anticipated
for the period." N.J.A.C. 5:94 app. A at 75.
Subsequently, in the un-adopted third iteration
of the Third Round rules ("Round
3.3"), COAH planned to rely solely on the
EDM, stating that, "The procedure employed
in this analysis is to use the output
of the [EDM]. The [EDM] forecasts the
future, and is the preferred model by the
State." 46 N.J.R. 952 (June 2, 2014).

<P20>Neither Dr. Angelides nor Dr. Kinsey
followed the Second Round exactly, as it
was impossible to do so with the HMM no
longer providing county or age group data,
and without CUPR's proprietary Econometric
Model, which was not reproducible
for use by the experts who designed methodologies
for the court.
<SPage 117>
Instead, Dr. Angelides
averaged population projections
from the EDM and HMM as in the Second
Round, but modified that Round's approach
by averaging the HMM and EDM
statewide population projections and then
applying EDM's county and age cohort
distributions to the statewide average to
yield averaged projections by county and
age cohort combinations.

<P20>While Dr. Angelides defended his approach
as the most faithful to COAH's
preferred method in the Second Round, he
also presented significant data to convince
the court to endorse his approach over
that of Dr. Kinsey, relying on recent statistics
to show that New Jersey's population
growth has slowed considerably in the
last few years. Since his approach produced
estimates that were the lower of the
two, Dr. Angelides urged the court to
adopt his projections as the demonstrably
more accurate ones. To make his point, Dr.
Angelides presented new intercensal 2016
Census Bureau population estimates,
which are released annually and update
the prior years' estimates back to the previous
decennial census. The new estimates
showed slower statewide population
growth for the 2010-2015 period than was
depicted in the 2015 Census updates. Dr.
Angelides also cited newly released 2016
NJLWD data to demonstrate that both the
HMM and EDM projections had overestimated
statewide population growth over
the 2000-2016 period, contending that his
averaged approach more closely tracked
the 2016 population estimates than Dr.
Kinsey's projections.

<P20>Dr. Kinsey's approach utilized a combination
of census population data and EDM
population projections. For 2015, Dr. Kinsey
relied on population estimates published
by the United States Census Bureau as
of July 1, 2015, while his 2025 population
estimates were derived from the EDM
projections. Dr. Kinsey asserted that incorporating
census population data at the
<Page 533>
beginning of the Prospective Need period
utilized the "most up-to-date available
data" even though he acknowledged that
COAH had not used different data sources
for the beginning and end of the Prospective
Need period in the Second Round. So,
despite his
<SPage 118>
avowed adherence to
COAH's Second Round methodology, Dr.
Kinsey did, in this instance and in a few
other steps, recommend some deviations
from COAH's approach in the Second
Round. Indeed, even though COAH in the
un-adopted Round 3.3 rules relied on the
EDM, it made no mention of utilizing Census
data in this step and generally avoided
inter-mixing data sources for population
projections in the manner recommended to
this court by Dr. Kinsey.

<P20>Special Master Reading was troubled by
Dr. Kinsey's inter-mixing of census population
estimates and EDM population projections
to calculate population growth
during the Prospective Need period. Reading
Rpt. (April 24, 2017), Ex. SM 1 at 8-11.
Mr. Reading concluded that, for the sake
of data consistency, Dr. Kinsey should
have used the same EDM population estimate
source for both 2015 and 2025. He
noted that Dr. Kinsey's inter-mixing of
data inappropriately skewed his results,
significantly increasing projected population
growth above both the approach used
by Dr. Angelides, and the EDM-only approach
that COAH had used in Round 3.3.
Mr. Reading provided statistics from
which the following chart was prepared to
compare the three methods:

   (Dr. Kinsey)
</T>
<B22>[<EMU>Ibid.</EMU> at 9-11.]

<P20>Mr. Reading testified that, although he
originally preferred use of the EDM to
project population for the Prospective
Need period because it was the only projection
done by county and age cohort, the
slower-than-expected recovery of the New
Jersey economy had caused the EDM to
significantly over-project population
<SPage 119>
growth in the last few years. As a result,
Mr. Reading recommended that the
court adopt Dr. Angelides' EDM & HMM
averaging methodology to reduce the probability
of error that could result if the
court relied only on the EDM model or on
Dr. Kinsey's approach that had used different
data sources at each end of the
projection period. He also testified that the
court's adoption of Dr. Angelides' approach
would result in adoption of population
estimates more in keeping with recent
demographic data than the projections utilized
by Dr. Kinsey. Mr. Reading further
testified that Dr. Angelides' method effectively
"recalibrated" the EDM population
projection distribution with the HMM
statewide projection, which was the lower
of the two approaches, and thus was the
more accurate estimate when compared to
recent New Jersey population trends.
While Dr. Kinsey was critical of the recalibration
done by Dr. Angelides because it
<Page 534>
could introduce error into the model, Mr.
Reading testified that such interpolations
were commonly employed in statistical
analysis and had been used by both experts
in other parts of their fair share
methodologies.

<P20>The court concurs with Mr. Reading's
recommendation and will adopt the approach
utilized by Dr. Angelides, but updated
to use the 2016 HMM and EDM
projections prepared by NJLWD, which
are now available. Notably, as the trial
progressed, new data was produced. Indeed,
as of the end of the trial, almost two
years&mdash;or 20 percent&mdash;of the Prospective
Need period of July 2015 to June 2025 had
elapsed. During that time, NJLWD released
updated models. In addition, while
Dr. Kinsey had cited the population projections
of the Rutgers Economic Advisory
Service (R/ECON) to support his prediction
of population growth of almost 42,000
annually, Dr. Powell testified that Rutgers
had subsequently reduced its population
growth projection to approximately 27,000
a year, far less than the growth advocated
by Dr. Kinsey, and closer to the estimate
used by Dr. Angelides. Moreover, although
there was testimony from Dr. Kinsey cautioning
the court about relying on population
swings over a short period of time, the
decreased rate of growth in New Jersey
since the recession started in 2008
<SPage 120>
has
continued for close to ten years despite an
economic upturn and cannot be ignored by
the court.

<P20>While both Dr. Kinsey and Mr. Bernard
urged the court to ignore the recent data
and employ the EDM, that model was
shown to have over-projected population in
the recent past to a significantly greater
degree than the HMM. Ignoring that reality
would contradict the direction of the
Supreme Court to use the best available
and most recent data. In addition, Dr.
Kinsey did not utilize the same population
data source at both end points of his projection,
but inter-mixed data in a way not
supported by any past COAH practice and
one leading to significant inflation of population
growth during the Prospective Need
period. As noted by Mr. Reading, in making
population projections, results can be
significantly skewed by even seemingly
small deviations caused by utilizing different
data sources at the endpoints.

<P20>Averaging the HMM and EDM as
COAH did in the Second Round thus
makes the most sense based on the record,
although the court acknowledges that even
averaging is not immune from error due to
the need to recalibrate the HMM using
EDM population distributions, as well as
the inherent speculative nature of all population
projections. Given the results of the
averaging, however, which better reflect
historical data from at least the last ten
years, the court finds the approach of Dr.
Angelides to be preferable at this point in
time. While Mr. Reading noted the availability
of other population projection
sources, such as R/ECON, he concluded
that there was insufficient evidence in the
record to deviate from COAH's primary
reliance on the EDM and HMM in Prior
Rounds. The court is also reluctant to
adopt a data source used neither by COAH
nor by any expert who designed a methodology
for judicial review.

<P20>Mr. Bernard, after acknowledging the
imprecision of all population projections,
simply asserted that all COAH could do
when faced with the similar uncertainty
inherent in making estimates of population
growth over a period of years was to do its
best. That is what the court has endeavored
to do here in the face of no
<SPage 121>
completely satisfactory alternative.
Thus, the court agrees with Mr. Reading
and endorses Dr. Angelides' approach to
estimating population growth in the Prospective
Need period by averaging EDM
<Page 535>
and HMM projections, following as closely
as possible what COAH had done in the
Second Round. Since NJLWD released updated
EDM and HMM models after Dr.
Angelides prepared his model, the court
directs that the newly updated, 2014-based
NJLWD projections released in 2016 be
used in the methodology, following Mr.
Reading's recommendation. Reading Rpt.
(April 24, 2017), Ex. SM 1 at 65. The court
thus adopts the following aggregated New
Jersey total estimated population for the
Third Round:

                            <EMU>2015</EMU>         <EMU>2025</EMU>        <EMU>Growth</EMU>

</T>
<CN>b. Estimate Population Living
in Households

<P20>The base unit in the calculation
of affordable housing need is households,
not population. Prospective LMI housing
need is derived by projecting the population
by age cohort and then converting this
result to households. 26 N.J.R. 2347 (June
6, 1994) (codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A).
The first step in this conversion is to estimate
the total population living in households
by removing from total population
estimates those individuals living in "group
quarters" who were not counted by COAH
as representing households in need of affordable
housing units. As noted by Dr.
Kinsey, the United States Census Bureau
defines the term "household" to exclude
people living in group quarters, and COAH
followed this approach. Kinsey Rpt. (May
17, 2016), Ex. DF 2 at 31. In the Second
Round, COAH determined the number of
people living in group quarters by using
the 1990 Census to update 1980 PUMS
data "to eliminate all individuals living in
institutions, group quarters, or as boarders/lodgers
from potential LMI housing
demand. This calculation removes from direct
count those
<SPage 122>
people who comprise
prison/sanitarium, college, nursing home,
boarders/boarding homes, and other related
populations." 26 N.J.R. 2343 (June 6,
1994) (codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A).

<P20>Notably, COAH excluded individuals
living in group quarters from people living
in households even though COAH provided
compliance credits to municipalities for
the creation of "alternative living arrangements."
COAH defined that term in
N.J.A.C. 5:93-1.1 as structures "in which
households live in distinct bedrooms, yet
share kitchen and plumbing facilities, central
heat and common areas." Included in
the definition were boarding houses, residential
care facilities, and group homes
for developmentally disabled or mentally
ill persons. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> N.J.A.C. 5:93-5.8 allows
municipalities to obtain compliance credits
for alternative living arrangements, with
credits being awarded for the number of
bedrooms created. While there is an inconsistency
in this approach in terms of
excluding individuals living in group quarters
from total population living in households
while simultaneously awarding bonus
credits for the creation of bedrooms
for some of the same people who reside in
alternative living arrangements, no expert
recommended including people living in
group quarters in the determination of affordable
housing need at this time, deeming
such a consideration to be a policy
judgment better left to an administrative
agency. The court reluctantly agrees with
this approach. Consequently, the court
will deduct the estimate of people living in
<Page 536>
group quarters from the total population
living in households as part of its fair
share methodology, although an administrative
agency should consider in the future
including in its population projections
the people housed in alternative living arrangements,
since increasing the bedrooms
available in such units can generate
bonus credits for municipalities in the
compliance process.

<P20>The estimation of the number of people
living in group quarters does not raise a
significant methodological dispute here because
Dr. Angelides and Dr. Kinsey recommended
similar percentages to deduct
from total population to account for those
individuals
<SPage 123>
living in group quarters. Indeed,
their percentages differed by negligible
amounts: 2.08 percent compared to 2.09
percent statewide, respectively, for 2015,
and 2.13 percent compared to 2.14 percent
statewide for 2025. Reading Rpt. (April 24,
2017), Ex. SM 1 at 12-13. While the percentages
were similar, application of them
to the substantially differing total population
estimates recommended by each expert
produced divergent results. Because
of the negligible difference between Drs.
Angelides' and Kinsey's percentage estimates
of population living in group quarters,
however, and to maintain consistency
with the prior step where the court accepted
Dr. Angelides' population estimates, the
court will accept Dr. Angelides' calculated
values of 2.08 percent and 2.13 percent
here. When the ratio calculated for group
quarters is applied to the total population
endorsed in the first step of the methodology,
the court determined the aggregated
New Jersey estimated population living in

<CN>c. Estimate Growth of Total Households

<P20>The next step is to convert the
estimated population living in households
into an estimate of the total number of
households at both the beginning and end
of the Prospective Need period. This conversion
requires the calculation and application
of headship rates to the projections
of population in households in 2015 and
2025. COAH described headship rates as
the "propensity to form a household," 26
N.J.R. 2347 (June 6, 1994) (codified at
N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A), a concept tracked by
estimating the percentage of people in
each of eight age groups who are heads of
households. The calculation also considers
the number of people in households.
Household projections are determined by
county and
<SPage 124>
by eight different "age cohorts,"
causing each expert to develop
headship rates for 168 combinations of age
group and county. While this concept may
appear to be relatively straightforward,
determining the headship rates to utilize in
the affordable housing model once again
thrust the court into a morass of conflicting
approaches, each of which had positive
and negative aspects. Again, no approach
was perfect, and none impressed the court
as significantly superior to the others. As
was true in selecting a population projection,
<Page 537>
following COAH practice in regard to
headship rates was challenging. Not only
did COAH utilize different approaches in
Prior Rounds, but it created certain ambiguities
in the Second Round that caused at
least two of the experts to refer to the
Second Round application of headship
rates as a "black box." Despite these difficulties,
the court reviewed the record and
selected the headship rates it deemed preferable
as part of the Prospective Need
methodology for use in the Third Round.

<P20>In Appendix A to the Second Round
Rules, 26 N.J.R. 2342-53 (June 6, 1994),
which Mr. Bernard testified was prepared
by COAH consultant Dr. Robert Burchell
of Rutgers University, COAH stated in a
section entitled "Household Projections"
that, "Headship rates are determined by
age group and county in New Jersey in
1990 and extended into the future at one-half
the rate of change observed from 1980
to 1990." 26 N.J.R. 2347 (June 6, 1994).
This statement endorses use of a trend
line in headship rates developed from the
ten-year period between the two most recent
decennial censuses and applied to
population projections to determine the
number of total households in the Prospective
Need period. Apparently, however,
COAH had used flat headship rates in the
First Round, and Appendix A from the
Second Round stated in a section entitled
"Prospective Need" that, "Both the population
cohorts for the base year (1993) and
the projection year (1999) are multiplied
by 1990 New Jersey county-specific headship
rates by age cohort," suggesting that
a flat headship rate was utilized instead of
a trend line. Given the explicit language in
the section governing "Household Projections,"
however, the consensus among the
experts was that COAH likely had developed
a
<SPage 125>
trend line and used one-half of
the rate of change observed between 1980
and 1990 to calculate its headship rates in
the Second Round. Notably, the descriptive
language in Appendix A did not state
clearly whether the trend line started in
1990, the year of the most recent decennial
census, or in 1993, the beginning of the
Prospective Need period for the Second
Round. Mr. Bernard testified that COAH
relied upon its consultant, Dr. Burchell, for
this aspect of the methodology and&mdash;given
the conflicting language in Appendix A&mdash;
Mr. Bernard could not be sure as to the
exact approach utilized in the Second
Round to determine headship rates.

<P20>The complexity inherent in determining
headship rates is underscored by the fact
that FSHC retained a national expert to
supplement testimony from Dr. Kinsey regarding
this issue. This aspect of the model
was the only area where FSHC looked
to an expert other than Dr. Kinsey. FSHC
retained Mr. McCue from the Joint Center
for Housing Studies at Harvard University
("Joint Center") to provide testimony to
the court regarding headship rates. While
FSHC likely expected Mr. McCue to support
Dr. Kinsey's use of flat headship rates
in the Prospective Need period, the Joint
Center changed its approach to using a
trend line after Dr. Kinsey finished his
model. As a result, Mr. McCue offered
rationales for alternative approaches, one
using a flat headship rate and the other
using a trend line. Although Dr. Angelides
had used a trend line in determining his
headship rates, Mr. McCue objected to Dr.
Angelides starting his trend line in 2014
instead of in 2010, the year of the most
recent decennial census. Starting in 2014
resulted in lower headship rates over the
Prospective Need period than would be the
case if the trend were started in 2010. The
court thus had to sort out the different
approaches advocated by the experts,
while remaining cognizant of their admonition
that even small deviations in headship
rates can translate into significant differences
in total households&mdash;a key building
<Page 538>
block in the methodology, and one that has
a major impact on the determination of
need. Indeed, the court was
<SPage 126>
cautioned
that an error in this part of the model
would be magnified throughout the rest of
the methodology.

<P20>Before looking more deeply into the different
approaches recommended by the
experts, the court will turn to aspects of
the methodology where they agree. Notably,
while the population estimates for the
model were based on NJLWD projections,
all of the experts developed their headship
rates using datasets prepared by the United
States Census Bureau. They used population
statistics from the two most recent
decennial censuses&mdash;2000 and 2010&mdash;finding
those datasets to be the most reliable
ones available. Since the Prospective Need
period began in 2015, Drs. Angelides and
Kinsey relied upon the most recent household
data available when they prepared
their reports&mdash;the 2014 ACS&mdash;a Census
Bureau product based on a sampling of
households and not a complete population
count. Although the ACS was not available
during the Second Round, Drs. Angelides
and Kinsey agreed that it was an appropriate
dataset to use in developing headship
rates for the Third Round. Notably, however,
Mr. McCue, who identified himself as
a housing demographer, testified that it is
well known that although the ACS reports
population estimates similar to those reported
in the decennial Census, the ACS
significantly underreports headship rates
throughout the country. To correct for this
acknowledged aberration, Drs. Angelides
and Kinsey adjusted the 2014 ACS headship
rates with a "calibration factor" calculated
by comparing 2010 Census&mdash;derived
and 2010 ACS&mdash;derived headship rates
and adjusting the ACS data to reflect the
Census-derived headship rates. While
some of the experts voiced concern at various
steps of the model concerning manipulating
data, the calibration done in this
step showed that some recalibration of
data is well-recognized when circumstances
require adjustments.

<P20>After recalibrating the ACS data, Dr.
Angelides then followed the explicit language
in Appendix A of the Second Round
by calculating a trend line at one-half the
change in headship rates between the two
most recent decennial Census years of
2000 and
<SPage 127>
2010 and then projecting the
trend to 2025 from the calibrated 2014
ACS headship rate, for each New Jersey
county and age cohort. From these trend
lines, Dr. Angelides determined aggregated
statewide 2015 and 2025 headship rates
of 37.04 percent and 37.45 percent, respectively.

<P20>Although Dr. Kinsey professed strong
allegiance to the Second Round practices
of COAH throughout the trial, he deviated
from the apparent Second Round methodology
by holding the calibrated 2014 ACS
headship rates steady from 2014 into 2015
and 2025. Dr. Kinsey justified this deviation
from the Second Round by citing an
annual study from the Joint Center for
2015, which used flat headship rates. Although
Dr. Kinsey held headship rates
constant in his projection, growth rate variations
between county and age cohort
pairs yielded increasing aggregated headship
rates of 37.11 percent and 37.71 percent
for 2015 and 2025 respectively. Reading
Rpt. (August 31, 2016), Ex. SM 4 at 36.

<P20>Drs. Angelides and Kinsey made the
following recommendations to the court:

<C5><EMU>New Jersey Aggregated Headship
Rates</EMU>
<Page 539>
<T>
                     <EMU>2015</EMU>       <EMU>2025</EMU>      <EMU>Difference</EMU>

  Dr. Angelides     37.04%     37.45%       00.41%

    Dr. Kinsey      37.11%     37.71%       00.60%
</T>
<B22>[Reading Rpt. (April 24, 2017), Ex. SM 1
at 18.]

<P00>While the differences seem minor, as noted
earlier, even small deviations in headship
rates can have a significant impact on calculating
total households, which in turn
affects the ultimate calculation of affordable
housing need throughout the State.

<P20>Although Mr. McCue testified that keeping
the headship rates flat, as Dr. Kinsey
did, was reasonable, he proposed yet a
third approach that used one-half of the
observed change in headship rates, similar
to what was advocated by Dr. Angelides,
but adopting 2010 as the starting point,
instead of 2014. Mr. McCue asserted that
projecting headship rate trend lines from
2014 would
<SPage 128>
not accurately reflect the
expected post-recession recovery in household
growth, citing studies indicating that
headship rates tend to correct back to
their long-term trends following recessions.

<P20>Special Master Reading accepted the
"recalibration" of ACS-derived headship
rates utilized by Drs. Angelides and Kinsey
as it yielded a reasonable correction to
known ACS headship rate deviations, and
enabled utilization of a more recent projection
year. Upon considering all of the alternatives,
he endorsed Dr. Angelides' approach,
but adjusted it to project from
2015, the beginning of the Prospective
Need period, instead of 2014, because
more recent data was now available that
coincided with the start of the period. Mr.
Reading also endorsed use of the trend
line over flat rates as consistent with what
he believed COAH had done in the Second
Round. In addition, Mr. Reading preferred
use of a trend line based on one-half of the
observed change because it mitigated the
extreme effects that could arise from relying
on an atypical time period, such as
2000 to 2010, which included three distinct
economic trends: pre-recession, recession,
and early recovery.

<P20>In support of his endorsement of Dr.
Angelides' trend line approach updated to
use 2015 ACS recalibrated data, Mr. Reading
cited the fact that the Joint Center,
relied upon by Dr. Kinsey as having used
flat rate headship projections, had recently
returned to relying upon a trend line calculated
with one-half the rate of change.
Mr. Reading rejected Mr. McCue's recommendation
to start the trend line in 2010,
however, because Mr. McCue had based
his opinion on nationwide data concerning
recovery from the recession, which data
was inconsistent with the much slower recovery
being experienced in New Jersey.
While noting that COAH's Second Round
rules were unclear as to whether COAH
had projected its one-half headship rate
trend line from the 1990 decennial Census
year, or had instead used 1993, the beginning
of the Second Round Prospective
Need period, Mr. Reading endorsed starting
the trend line at the beginning of the
Prospective Need period as making more
sense in the current circumstances
<SPage 129>
given recent economic trends in New
Jersey and the availability of actual data
for 2015.

<P20>In determining the appropriate methodology
for this step, the court must choose
both a proper projection starting year and
headship rate approach. First, the court
agrees with Mr. Reading that it makes
<Page 540>
sense to project headship rates from the
beginning of the Prospective Need period
using newly available, although appropriately
recalibrated ACS data, a dataset that
was not available to COAH in the Second
Round. The court prefers use of a trend
line over a flat rate because the record
strongly suggests that COAH followed this
procedure in the Second Round and the
Joint Center recently endorsed a trend
line approach. Indeed, when pressed on
cross-examination, Mr. McCue expressed a
slight preference at this point in time for
developing a trend line using one-half the
observed change in headship rates, unsurprisingly
endorsing the recent change implemented
by the Joint Center in its national
housing study.

<P20>The selection of the starting point for
the trend line presents a thornier issue
because the reasons supporting the choices
made by the experts did not point to a
definite answer. Nor was there explicit
guidance from COAH to follow. But it did
appear that Mr. McCue's recommendation
was based on a national rebound from the
recession that has not been replicated in
New Jersey, which is recovering at a slower
rate. Mr. McCue admitted to not being
an economist and to a general lack of
familiarity with both recent economic
trends in New Jersey and COAH practice.
He did acknowledge, however, that headship
rates in New Jersey were abnormally
low and that his own trend line had anticipated
more significant growth than had
actually occurred in the State based on
recent data. He also stated that increases
in headship rates lag behind improvement
in other economic areas such as employment
following a recession, suggesting to
the court that the starting point for the
trend line recommended by Mr. Reading
as an adjustment to the one endorsed by
Dr. Angelides offers the best alternative
based on recent economic conditions in
New Jersey.
<SPage 130>
Indeed, the court is not
persuaded based on the record that New
Jersey's headship rates will recover to pre-recession
levels by the end of the Prospective
Need period, as assumed by Mr.
McCue, who recommended projecting from
2010. In addition, COAH noted in the Second
Round that headship rate growth is
typically greatest in the younger age
groups, 26 N.J.R. 2347 (June 6, 1994), and
there was testimony in the record that
New Jersey has more young adults living
with their parents than any other state in
the country. These considerations also persuaded
the court to reject Mr. McCue's
trend line. The court further notes that
while Mr. McCue is a national expert in
headship rates, Mr. Reading is much more
familiar with economic trends in New Jersey,
so that his endorsement of starting
the trend line in 2015 based on the current
state of the New Jersey economy carried
greater weight.

<P20>The court also concurs with Mr. Reading
that a one-half headship rate projection is
appropriate to account for the uncertainties
presented by the period following the
Great Recession. Indeed, the court finds a
one-half headship rate trend line, projected
from 2015, to be reasonable as it strikes
an appropriate balance between Mr.
McCue's proposal, which too optimistically
assumes household trends will recover by
the end of the Prospective Need period to
where they would have been but for the
recession, and Dr. Kinsey's flat headship
rate approach that completely disregards
prevailing housing trends. Moreover, as
noted by Mr. McCue, there is only a slight
difference between the headship rates endorsed
by Dr. Angelides and Dr. Kinsey,
despite their dissimilar approaches, while
the difference between those headship
rates and the ones produced by Mr.
McCue's alternate trend line projecting
from 2010 was much more pronounced.
<Page 541>

<P20>The court is thus much more comfortable
selecting Dr. Angelides' trend line,
which resulted in headship rates closer to
the ones advocated by Dr. Kinsey, than it
is endorsing Mr. McCue's trend line, which
produced more aberrant results. The court
consequently will follow Mr. Reading's recommendation
and adopt Dr. Angelides'
trend line using one-half the observed rate
of change in
<SPage 131>
headship rates when projecting
2015 and 2025 headship rates, but
will project from calibrated 2015 ACS-derived
headship rates, as suggested by Mr.
Reading. After reviewing all of the alternatives,
this one is the best. The court also
notes that since it endorsed the population
projection approach advocated by Dr. Angelides
and Mr. Reading, the headship
rates selected by the court will be applied
to those projections. The results of this
analysis, showing the aggregated New Jersey
estimated growth in total households
in the Prospective Need period, are reflected
in the following chart:

<C5><EMU>New Jersey Total Households 2015-2025</EMU>

</T>
<CN>d. Estimate LMI household growth
during the Prospective Need
period

<P20>Once the projected numbers of
total households at the beginning and end
of the Prospective Need period have been
determined, the next step is to estimate
the proportion of those households that
qualify as LMI at each point in time. Having
those estimates will allow the court to
determine the growth of LMI households
during the period ("LMI Household
Growth"), another key factor in the development
of the fair share methodology. In
the Prior Rounds, COAH accomplished
this step by calculating and then applying
the ratios of LMI households to total
households ("LMI Household Ratio") by
county and age cohort, and then aggregating
the results to the regions. Prior Round
rules do not reveal the precise calculations
COAH used in this step, although some
guidance can be gleaned from COAH's
statements. In evaluating Drs. Angelides'
and Kinsey's approaches, the court has
identified two distinct sub-steps that require
consideration: 1) selection of income
qualification data to use in calculating
LMI Household Ratios, and 2) how LMI
Household Ratios are applied
<SPage 132>
to Total
Household projections to estimate LMI
Household Growth in the Prospective
Need period. The court discusses each in
turn.

<CN>i. Income Qualification Data Used in
Determining LMI Household
Ratio Calculation

<P20>In the Prior Rounds, COAH calculated
LMI Household Ratios in this step of
the methodology by utilizing income grids
it developed from median income thresholds
established by the Federal Department
of Housing and Urban Development
("HUD") for its affordable housing programs,
as authorized in the FHA:

<B22>Moderate income housing means housing
affordable according to [HUD] or
other recognized standards for home
ownership and rental costs and occupied
or reserved for occupancy by households
with a gross household income equal to
more than 50% but less than 80% of the
median gross household income for
<Page 542>
households of the same size within the
region in which the housing is located.

<B22>[N.J.S.A. 52:27D-304(d).]

<P00>By incorporating HUD standards into its
fair share methodology, COAH was following
the suggestion of the Supreme Court
in <EMU>Mount Laurel II</EMU>, 92 N.J. at 220-21 n. 8,
456 A.2d 390, which acknowledged the benefit
of incorporating well-accepted federal
standards into New Jersey's affordable
housing program.

<P20>COAH's Second Round rule-making expressly
noted that the agency was using
HUD income limits, based upon household
size, to establish the LMI income thresholds
from which LMI Household Ratios
were determined:

<B22>Total households for [1993 and 1999] are
converted to low- and moderate-income
households by carrying forward the income
characteristics of all households in
1990 to 1993 and 1999 by age cohort.
Low- and moderate-income households
are sorted by applying the Section 8
household size/income qualification criteria
that were used in 1992....

<B22>[26 N.J.R. 2347 (June 6, 1994) (codified
at N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A).]

<P20>COAH used HUD median income data
from each county in New Jersey to calculate
a weighted average median income for
a family of four for each region. N.J.A.C.
5:93-7.4(a). COAH then calculated median
incomes for households larger and smaller
than four by
<SPage 133>
applying multipliers used
by HUD, as shown for Region Four in
2014:

</T>
<B22>[Angelides Rpt. (May 18, 2016), Ex. P 2
at 42.]

<P00>COAH made the policy decision to adopt
HUD's multiplier adjustments to establish
median income thresholds "based on the
philosophy that if you have more children/dependents
or household members
you can earn more and still qualify for
moderate/low income; in reverse fashion, if
you have fewer dependents or members, it
is more difficult to qualify by establishing
a lower income for qualification." 26 N.J.R.
2345 (June 6, 1994) (codified at N.J.A.C.
5:93 app. A).

<P20>It is important to note that COAH
used its HUD-based income grids both to
calculate fair share affordable housing obligations,
as well as to set maximum rent
and sales prices for LMI housing units
throughout the State of New Jersey. The
calculation of need thus directly relates to
the household income requirements governing
access to affordable housing. Notably,
other State agencies have also adopted
the COAH income grid to qualify LMI
households for affordable housing, achieving
a welcome uniformity. Prior to 2001,
COAH, the Department of Community Affairs
(DCA), and the New Jersey Housing
and Mortgage Finance Agency (HMFA)
had adopted inconsistent and overlapping
sets of rules regarding the continuing affordability
of housing constructed pursuant
to the FHA. <EMU>In re Adoption of Unif. Hous.
Affordability Controls</EMU>, 390 N.J. Super. 89,
95, 914 A.2d 402 (App. Div. 2007). In 2001,
HMFA established the Uniform Housing
Affordability Controls (UHAC), N.J.A.C.
<Page 543>
5:80-26.1 to -26.26, which were subsequently
also adopted by COAH, N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.17,
and DCA, N.J.A.C. 5:43-4.10. <EMU>In re
Adoption of Unif. Hous.</EMU>, 390 N.J. Super.
<SPage 134>
at 96, 914 A.2d 402. UHAC created a
single regulatory scheme to be used by
State and municipal affordable housing administrators
and provided an array of new
enforcement tools to ensure compliance.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU> (citing 36 N.J.R. 3660 (Aug. 16,
2004)). UHAC's restrictions on sales prices
and rents for affordable housing units are
based on COAH's income grid, with
UHAC defining median income as, "the
median income by household size for an
applicable county, as adopted annually by
COAH." N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.2.

<P20>For this step in the methodology, the
experts' approaches differed substantially.
Dr. Kinsey used an income grid in his
calculations, but because COAH had not
released an updated income grid since
2014, Dr. Kinsey updated the grid himself
utilizing what he determined to be COAH's
Prior Round methodology and the HUD
2015 county income limits by family size.
Kinsey Rpt. (May 17, 2016), Ex. DF 2 at
39. Dr. Angelides, on the other hand, rejected
COAH's income grid, and calculated
LMI Household Ratios from mathematical
median incomes, relying on the language
in the FHA that identified LMI households
as those with gross household incomes
less than 80 percent of the median
gross household income for households of
the same size within the region in which
the housing is located. N.J.S.A. 52:27D-304(c),
(d). Dr. Angelides calculated median
incomes directly from the one-year 2014
ACS data for each household size by region.
He then set LMI thresholds below
eighty percent of the calculated median
household incomes for each household size
by region.

<P20>Dr. Angelides criticized COAH's methodology
as resulting in arbitrary median
income thresholds that did not reflect actual,
measurable median household incomes,
and asserted that they ultimately produced
LMI proportions in violation of the FHA.
Dr. Angelides noted, for example, that the
COAH grid was overly generous to one
and two-person households by allowing
them to qualify for affordable housing with
much higher incomes than actual median
incomes for those household sizes would
allow. Dr. Angelides asserted that his approach
mitigated the statistical anomalies
inherent in the Prior Round methodology
that eschewed
<SPage 135>
true median incomes in
favor of the HUD-derived medians incorporated
into the COAH income grid.

<P20>Special Master Reading preferred Dr.
Angelides' approach because it utilized
precise mathematical calculations based on
actual median incomes and produced approximate
forty percent LMI Household
Ratios, consistent with the mathematical
definition of median when applied to the
FHA. Mr. Reading disagreed with Dr.
Kinsey's use of an income grid because the
grids were developed for the purpose of
qualifying people to obtain affordable
housing, not to determine affordable housing
obligations that must be met by municipalities.
Mr. Reading also expressed concern
regarding Dr. Kinsey's use of HUD's
median incomes, because HUD had recently
changed its method for determining median
incomes and was now utilizing ACS
data. However, while expressing concern
that COAH had not effectively updated its
HUD-derived income grid since 2012, Mr.
Reading nonetheless testified that, despite
his disagreement with the use of an income
grid for determining affordable housing
need, he accepted Dr. Kinsey's method for
updating the COAH income grid as sound.
Mr. Reading added that HUD's new method
for determining median incomes would
likely have been accepted by COAH, were
the agency still functioning. Dr. Kinsey
incorporated the new HUD procedure into
<Page 544>
the COAH-inspired grid he prepared and
utilized in his methodology.

<P20>The court rejects Dr. Angelides' assertion
that the use by COAH and Dr. Kinsey
of income grids to calculate affordable
housing obligations violates the FHA. The
FHA explicitly references HUD standards,
as quoted above, and COAH repeatedly
made the unambiguous policy decision to
use the same income grid for determining
affordable housing need as it used for income
qualification and for the pricing of
affordable housing units. Indeed, Mr. Bernard
cited text from the summary of proposed
changes to COAH's First Round
rules in which COAH determined to use
income grids as a means to remedy situations
where individual LMI households
that were included in need calculations
could not afford the LMI housing constructed
within their region:
<SPage 136>

<B22>The Council believes that the standards
set for pricing and income qualification
in a region should be the same as
that used to determine need. Therefore,
the Council is proposing regional income
standards, to eliminate such inequities,
based on New Jersey income data.

<B22>[25 N.J.R. 1121 (March 15, 1993).]

<P20>The same HUD-derived income
data was used in the Second Round. 26
N.J.R. 2344-45 (June 6, 1994) (codified at
N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A). COAH's interpretation
and application of the FHA is entitled
to deference. Indeed, a long period of consistent
construction by an administrative
agency in the field of its expertise should
be given great weight by the courts. <EMU>Mastrobattista
v. Essex Cnty. Park Comm'n</EMU>,
46 N.J. 138, 146, 215 A.2d 345 (1965);
<EMU>Pringle v. N.J. Dep't of Civil Serv.</EMU>, 45
N.J. 329, 332-33, 212 A.2d 360 (1965).
While the court appreciates Mr. Reading's
fidelity to mathematical principles and
thus his preference for calculating LMI
Household Ratios using true mathematical
median incomes, the court cannot accept
his recommendation in this regard. COAH
repeatedly endorsed the use of a HUD-derived
grid system to determine median
income thresholds, by household size, as
an important policy that linked the determination
of affordable housing obligations
to the means of qualifying households that
could access that affordable housing.
COAH made this policy decision through
the regulatory process with public participation
and judicial oversight. In addition,
the UHAC regulations now directly link
the continuing affordability of housing
constructed pursuant to the FHA to the
COAH income grid for a number of State
agencies. To discard the income grid at
this juncture would not only undercut established
policy decisions by COAH, but
could very well lead to an imbalance between
affordable housing units made available
pursuant to constitutional requirements
and LMI households that qualify to
live in that housing.

<P20>To illustrate this point, Mr. Bernard
demonstrated that under Dr. Angelides'
methodology, persons making less than
$32,000 would have trouble affording any
of the LMI housing that is regulated
through the UHAC regulations. Moreover,
in endorsing the use of an income grid, as
updated by Dr. Kinsey based on
<SPage 137>
HUD
standards and COAH methodology, this
court is following the admonition of the
Supreme Court to follow the Prior Rounds
and refrain from acting as an administrative
agency charged with making policy
decisions. Indeed, in the South Brunswick
methodology trial, Judge Wolfson adopted
Dr. Kinsey's approach, citing the fact that
he had utilized COAH's income grid. <EMU>In re
Township of South Brunswick</EMU>, 448 N.J.
Super. at 458, 153 A.3d 981. The court
therefore accepts Dr. Kinsey's updated
COAH income grid that Mr. Reading recognized
as reasonable and adopts its use in
<Page 545>
determining LMI Household Ratios in this
step.

<CN>ii. Application of LMI Household Ratios

<P20>Although the court agrees with
Dr. Kinsey that an updated COAH income
grid should be used to determine LMI
Household Ratios, the court cannot fully
endorse his approach to determining LMI
Household Growth in the Prospective
Need period using that grid because Dr.
Kinsey deviated from Prior Round methodology
in the application of those LMI
Household Ratios.

<P20>COAH's Second Round rules only briefly
summarize the calculations performed to
estimate LMI Household Growth, yet the
court was able to glean valuable insights
regarding the best approach to apply from
clarifying language added by COAH to the
un-adopted Round 3.3 rules, as well as
from testimony given at trial. In discussing
the methodology used to estimate LMI
Household Growth during the Second
Round Prospective Need period from 1993
to 1999, COAH stated that:

<B22>Total households for [the first year and
last year of the Prospective Need period]
are converted to low- and moderate-income
households by carrying forward
the income characteristics of all households
in 1990 to 1993 and 1999 by age
cohort. Low- and moderate-income
households are sorted by applying the
Section 8 household size/income qualification
criteria that were used in 1992 to
a different number of households that
exist in each [age] cohort in 1993 and
1999. Thus, to the degree that age cohorts
are differently composed and
growing differently, the low- and moderate-income
population will also change
as it ages into the future.

<B22>[26 N.J.R. 2347 (June 6, 1994) (codified
at N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A).]

<P00>Although this Second Round language suggested
that the methodology could result
in significant changes in age distribution in
the LMI population during the Prospective
Need period, language
<SPage 138>
added in the un-adopted
Round 3.3 rules made clear as
recently as 2014 that, despite any change
in the composition of the LMI population,
the methodology should still produce an
overall proportion of LMI Household
Growth to Total Household Growth during
the Prospective Need period ("LMI
Household Growth Rate") of about forty
percent:

<B22>... to the degree that age cohorts are
differently composed and growing differently,
the low- and moderate-income
population will also change as it ages
into the future. Nonetheless, almost by
definition, about 40 percent (40.622%) of
household growth will be comprised of
low- and moderate-income household
growth.

<B22>[46 N.J.R. 953 (June 2, 2014).]

<P20>Since COAH's proposed Round 3.3 language
appeared to fundamentally reprise
this step from the Second Round methodology,
the court found this comment instructive
on two points. First, despite any
variations from true mathematical median
incomes introduced by the use of income
grids in these calculations, the percent of
household growth comprised of LMI
households should still be near the forty
percent that calculations using true mathematical
median incomes would have produced.
That follows from the definition of
LMI households in the FHA that references
fifty percent of eighty percent of
median incomes. Secondly, COAH made
clear that the ratio of LMI Households to
total households would be "about 40 percent"
despite demographic shifts in age
cohorts during the Prospective Need period.
<EMU>See also In Re Adoption of N.J.A.C.
5:94 & 5:95</EMU>, 390 N.J. Super. at 38, 914
<Page 546>
A.2d 348, where the Appellate Division
acknowledged COAH's determination that
"approximately forty percent" of household
growth in the Third Round would
qualify as LMI households.

<P20>The un-adopted Round 3.3 rule-making
process also added an appendix that provided
additional insights into the methodological
steps to utilize in the then Prospective
Need period of 2014 to 2024. There
COAH noted that the statewide LMI
Household Ratio at the end of the Prospective
Need period was assumed to be
the same as the statewide LMI household
ratio at the beginning of the Prospective
Need period:
<SPage 139>

<B22>The first step in understanding low-
and moderate-income housing need in
New Jersey is identifying the share of
households with incomes below 80 percent
of their regional medians &mdash; those
households qualifying for housing assistance
through federal and state programs.
This methodology then assumes
that the same portion of New Jersey's
new households [in 2024] will be below
80 percent of their regional median incomes
as were below 80 percent of their
regional median [in 2014]....

<B22>[46 N.J.R. 982 (June 2, 2014).]

<P00>COAH further demonstrated that the constant
LMI Household Ratio that was calculated
at the beginning of the Prospective
Need period would result in the same
overall LMI Household Growth Rate during
the period:

<B22>According to these procedures, low- and
moderate-income households represent
40.622 percent of all households in the
State [as of 2014]. If 40.622 percent of
the households New Jersey is expected
to add between 2014 and 2024 similarly
qualify for affordable housing, Rutgers'
projections imply that 62,582 additional
households will qualify for affordable
housing over the 10 year period.

<B22>[46 N.J.R. 984 (June 2, 2014).]

<P20>Mr. Bernard, former Executive Director
of COAH, confirmed in testimony that
COAH had similarly utilized constant LMI
Household Ratios that were calculated at
the beginning of the Prospective Need period
to determine LMI Household Growth
in the Second Round. Mr. Bernard further
explained that LMI Household Ratios
could deviate from exactly forty percent
because they were not derived from "true
medians," but from median incomes based
on the COAH income grid.

<P20>Further confirmation of COAH's use of
constant LMI Household Ratios, as well as
the rationale for doing so, was provided
during Dr. Kinsey's testimony in an excerpt
from a book by Dr. Robert Burchell,
who was the primary consultant working
with COAH in developing Prior Round
methodologies:

<B22>The income distribution among society's
population is a function of many past
and present conditions....

<B22>Rather than attempting to project these
many practically imponderable future
conditions, the share of Mount Laurel
households as a percent of regional population
base is assumed to remain constant
over the time period projected in
this study. What this says is that the
proportion of those households at 80
percent of median income or less and
observed in 1980, will be assumed to
remain constant by age cohort into the
future. The size of the cohort may
change due to the effects of assumptions
regarding births, deaths, and migration
by age cohort, but the share of Mount
Laurel eligibles within each age-cohort
will remain the same.
<SPage 140>

<B22>[Kinsey Rpt. (May 17, 2016), Ex. DF
67 at 5 (quoting Robert Burchell, <EMU>Mount
Laurel II: Challenge and Delivery of</EMU>
<Page 547>
<EMU>Low-Cost Housing</EMU>, Center for Urban
Policy Research, 1983, at 124-25).]

<P00>In this excerpt, Dr. Burchell made clear
that because predicting future median income
levels involved "many imponderables,"
LMI Household ratios were not calculated
at the end of the Prospective Need
period. Instead, LMI Household Ratios
calculated at the beginning of the Prospective
Need period for each age cohort were
held constant, which agrees with the language
contained in the un-adopted Round
3.3 rule-making process, for which Dr.
Burchell also served as a COAH consultant.

<P20>Given COAH's Second Round
methodology, and the additional guidance
provided in the un-adopted Round 3.3 rulemaking
process, as well as by COAH's
former Executive Director and Dr. Burchell,
the court concludes that the proper
approach here is to calculate LMI Household
Ratios, by age cohort, at the beginning
of the Prospective Need period, then
apply those ratios to Total Households at
the beginning and end of the period to
determine LMI Household Growth. The
court also concludes that the resulting
LMI Household Growth Rate during the
Prospective Need period should be "about
40 percent".

<CN>(a) Dr. Angelides

<P20>Dr. Angelides did apply constant 2015
LMI Household Ratios to 2025 household
data, but as discussed previously, he utilized
median incomes derived directly from
ACS data instead of using the COAH income
grid. Dr. Angelides' approach resulted
in a negligible variation in LMI rates
for 2015 and 2025 when aggregated to the
State level and an LMI Household Growth
Rate of 40.71 percent, as shown in the
following chart:

<B22>[Reading Rpt. (August 31, 2016), Ex. SM
4 at 48.]

<P20>While the court acknowledges that Dr.
Angelides' use of LMI Household Ratios of
"about 40 percent" is consistent with
COAH practice, the court cannot accept
his approach because it is not based on the
COAH grid and results in a mismatch
<Page 548>
between affordable housing obligations and
income qualifications. The court will, therefore,
review the approach advocated by Dr.
Kinsey, who appropriately used an updated
income grid in this step of the methodology.

<CN>(b) Dr. Kinsey

<P20>Although Dr. Kinsey testified that he
followed the Second Round in calculating
LMI Household Growth, he actually deviated
from COAH's approach substantially
by not applying constant LMI Household
Ratios in his calculations. Dr. Kinsey calculated
LMI Household Ratios by age cohort
and county for 2015 by "sorting" updated
PUMS Census income data by his
income grid-derived 2015 regional LMI income
thresholds. Kinsey Rpt. (May 17,
2016), Ex. DF 2 at 38-41. Dr. Kinsey then
applied his calculated 2015 LMI Household
Ratios to 2015 intercensal population
<SPage 142>
estimates and determined that 41.41
percent of the State's 3.2 million households
qualified as LMI in 2015. Reading
Rpt. (April 24, 2017), Ex. SM 1 at 22-25.
However, Dr. Kinsey did not then apply
his 2015 calculated LMI ratios to 2025
population projections, but instead repeated
his calculations for 2025 utilizing
the same regional 2015 LMI income
thresholds, yielding an aggregated 2025
statewide LMI household ratio of 42.96
percent, a significant increase over 2015.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU> More strikingly, Dr. Kinsey's approach
produced a statewide LMI Household
Growth Rate of 67.65 percent during
the Prospective Need period, resulting in a
significant deviation between the two experts'
conclusions:

<B22>[<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>]

<P20>Special Master Reading took issue with
Dr. Kinsey's approach, pointing out that in
his January 22, 2016, gap period report for
the Ocean County <EMU>Mount Laurel</EMU> methodology
trial, Dr. Kinsey had projected LMI
Household Ratios to be stable and essentially
unchanged at about 41.30 percent
during the 1999 to 2015 gap period. Reading
Rpt. (April 24, 2017), Ex. SM 1 at 26-27
(citing Ex. P 98 at 19). Mr. Reading
concluded that while Dr. Kinsey's
<SPage 143>
statewide 2015 LMI Household Ratio of
41.41 percent for these proceedings appeared
to be within reasonable proximity
to COAH's previously endorsed range, his
<Page 549>
2025 ratio of 42.96 percent was an outlier,
which Mr. Reading concluded was caused
by Dr. Kinsey's inappropriate mixing of
data sources. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 22. Moreover, Mr.
Reading concluded that Dr. Kinsey's significant
increase in LMI proportions between
2015 and 2025 led to the untenable
conclusion that 67.65 percent of total
household growth during the Prospective
Need period was in LMI households.

<P20>Mr. Reading reiterated that, as in the
calculations of headship rates, it is not the
absolute LMI Household Ratios that have
a disproportionate effect on LMI Household
Growth, but rather the changes between
those ratios over the Prospective
Need period. As an example, Mr. Reading
demonstrated that an increase of two percent
in LMI household ratios over the
Prospective Need period in a state with 3.3
million households would add about 66,000
LMI households. Mr. Reading further illustrated
his point when he adjusted Dr.
Kinsey's approach by applying constant
2015 LMI household ratios to Dr. Kinsey's
2025 Total Households projections, which
yielded a decrease of 26.24 percentage
points in Dr. Kinsey's incremental statewide
LMI Household Growth Rate, even
though Dr. Kinsey's two statewide LMI
Household Ratios only differed by 1.55
percentage points.

<B22>[Reading Rpt. (April 24, 2017), Ex. SM 1
at 22, 25.]

<P20>Regarding the application of LMI
Household Ratios, the court finds that
COAH projected LMI Household Growth
during the Prospective Need period in Prior
Rounds by calculating LMI
<SPage 144>
Household Ratios at the beginning of
the Prospective Need period and then applying
those ratios at the end of the period.
Mr. Reading and Mr. Bernard provided
testimony to support that result, which
is also consistent with COAH's approach in
the Second Round, as clarified and further
explained by COAH in the un-adopted
Round 3.3 rule-making process, which the
court considers persuasive in this instance.
The result is also supported by the excerpt
from Dr. Burchell's book that was provided
by Dr. Kinsey.

<P20>Further, COAH was clear in the un-adopted
Round 3.3 rule-making that LMI
Household Growth during the Prospective
Need period should be "about 40 percent."
Although no acceptable range of values
was defined, the court concludes that Dr.
Kinsey's aggregated statewide LMI
Household Growth Rate of 67.65 percent
so exceeds the 40 percent accepted by
COAH as to require its rejection by the
court. Moreover, deviations from the
"about 40 percent" standard were even
more glaring in Dr. Kinsey's countywide
LMI Household Growth Rates, which were
widely varied and ranged from negative 37
percent to 111 percent:

<B22>[Kinsey Rpt. (May 17, 2016), CD-ROM
Tab 1c, 1c1.]

<P20>Dr. Burchell endorsed keeping the LMI
Household Ratios constant to avoid the
uncertainties inevitably faced when making
multi-year projections like these. The
court shares that concern, as did COAH,
and rejects the widely varying LMI
Household Growth Rates produced by Dr.
Kinsey's approach here. The court was
also concerned by Dr. Kinsey's persistent
assertion that he was closely following the
Second Round when a careful examination
of his
<SPage 145>
LMI Household Growth Rates
showed an undeniable deviation from the
COAH approach. Moreover, Dr. Kinsey
himself used a constant household growth
ratio in at least one report that he produced
in the course of the Third Round
judicial proceedings.

<P20>In this step of the methodology, then,
the court finds that neither expert's approach
is satisfactory, with both deviating
from COAH's Prior Round methodology in
unacceptable ways. Dr. Angelides' approach
applied constant LMI Household
Ratios, but disregarded COAH's explicit
policy decision to utilize the COAH income
grid, while Dr. Kinsey utilized an updated
COAH-inspired income grid, but failed to
apply constant LMI Household Ratios as
COAH did in the Prior Rounds. Notably,
Mr. Reading's modification of Dr. Kinsey's
approach utilized both an updated income
grid and constant LMI Household Ratios.
Therefore, the court will adopt Mr. Reading's
modification of Dr. Kinsey's approach,
utilizing constant 2015 LMI
Household Ratios, calculated using Dr.
Kinsey's updated COAH income grid as
endorsed by the court in the previous step.
Note, however, that some of the numbers
contained in the following chart differ from
those on page eighty-three due to the use
of updated population figures and the
trended headship rate adjustment that the
court directed Mr. Reading to use in making
the calculations required by this decision.
As a result, the following chart shows
the aggregated New Jersey estimated
LMI Household Growth incorporated into
the court's fair share methodology:

<C5><EMU>Statewide LMI Household Growth

   LMI HH Growth      +73,209
</T>
<Page 551>
<SPage 146>

<CN>e. Reallocation for age distribution
of households

<P20>The next step in the Second
Round methodology was to pool the working
age component of projected LMI
Household Growth on a statewide basis for
reallocation to regions with prior job
growth:

<B22>... the growth of households below age
65 is put into a statewide pool and allocated
to regions of the state according to
the proportional share of nonresidential
ratable growth that took place in these
regions from 1980 to 1990. Thus, growth
in the working-age component of low-
and moderate-income households was
assigned to regions where jobs previously
grew. On the other hand, growth in
the elderly and presumably non-working
population was retained in the original
region where this growth took place.

<B22>[26 N.J.R. 2347 (June 6, 1994) (codified
at N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A).]

<P00>However, both Dr. Angelides and Dr. Kinsey
projected actual decreases in the number
of working age households, with all
LMI Household Growth attributed to
households headed by persons of at least
sixty-five years of age, reflecting the demographics
of the aging baby boomer generation.
<EMU>See</EMU> Reading Rpt. (August 31,
2016), Ex. SM 4 at 50. Thus, because no
growth is projected in working age households
during the Prospective Need period,
the court will skip this step in the methodology
for the Third Round from 2015-2025,
as did both experts.

<CN>f. Account for older LMI households
with significant housing assets
(Angelides proposal)

<P20>Dr. Angelides included a "significant
housing assets" test in his Prospective
Need methodology to remove from
LMI household projections those LMI
households that were LMI with respect to
annual household income, but that possess
significant housing assets. Dr. Angelides
noted that the UHAC regulations contain
a real estate asset test that would disqualify
otherwise income-eligible LMI households
from qualifying for affordable housing.
Angelides Rpt. (May 16, 2016), Ex. P
2 at 52 (citing N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.16(b)3). Dr.
Angelides also noted that each iteration of
COAH's Third Round methodology included
an asset test. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> He applied his test
comparing the sum of eligible assets as
reported in the 2014 one-year PUMS to
the 2014 regional asset
<SPage 147>
limits published
by COAH, calculating the proportion of
disqualified LMI households by region and
household size. Dr. Angelides' test yielded
an aggregated statewide proportion of 8.8
percent of the LMI Household Growth
between 2015 and 2025. Application of this
proportion resulted in a decrease of 5,400
LMI households statewide. Reading Rpt.
(August 31, 2016), Ex. SW 4 at 50.

<P20>Mr. Bernard testified that COAH had
considered excluding LMI households with
assets, along with other potential changes,
in both the First and Second Rounds, but
declined to do so. In addition, the defendants
pointed out that although COAH did
include an asset test in the various iterations
of the Third Round rules, the impact
of using the test&mdash;which would have decreased
fair share obligations&mdash;was offset
by other changes that would have increased
fair share obligations. Special
Master Reading noted that since all projected
growth in New Jersey is anticipated
to be in senior citizen households, an asset
test made sense because many senior citizens
own their own homes, often mortgage-free,
and are thus not in need of
affordable housing. In the final analysis,
however, Mr. Reading recommended
against adopting this test because it had
not been included by COAH in the First or
Second Rounds and constituted an important
<Page 552>
policy decision that he concluded
should be vetted by an agency reviewing a
comprehensive revision of COAH rules before
adoption.

<P20>The court acknowledges that COAH declined
to include an asset test in the Prior
Rounds, but then did so in all three iterations
of its Third Round rules. However, in
each of the three iterations, COAH linked
the reduction of affordable housing obligations
that would result from an asset
test with an offset from a new calculation
that would likely increase need, such as
including individuals living in certain group
quarters. COAH stated in Round 3.2 that:

<B22>low- and moderate-income owners with
significant assets &mdash;those who have paid
off their mortgages and spend less than
38 percent of their income on other
housing costs &mdash; are removed from [affordable
housing obligations], and low-
and moderate-income residents of non-institutional
group quarters are added to
[affordable housing obligations], to reach
a Total Projected Need....
<SPage 148>

<B22>[N.J.A.C. 5:97 app. A at 89 ("Round
3.2").]

<P00>And in Round 3.3. COAH similarly asserted
that:

<B22>While owners with significant assets reduce
the overall need, demand from low-
and moderate-income households in
group quarters increases the overall
need. The 2000 and 2010 Censuses specify
the populations in [noninstitutionalized]
group quarters ... A portion of
residents living in "other" noninstitutional
group quarters are included in
this methodology.

<B22>[46 N.J.R. 984 ("Round 3.3"); <EMU>see also</EMU>
N.J.A.C. 5:94 app. A at 65, 79 ("Round
3.1").]

<P20>While the asset test constitutes a reasonable
revision to Prior Round methodology,
it is the kind of policy decision that
should be fully vetted by an administrative
agency in the context of rulemaking. Here,
COAH did consider and adopt such an
asset test as part of its Third Round rules,
and did provide sufficient detail to allow
Dr. Angelides to replicate the test for the
current Prospective Need period. However,
the addition of the asset test was never
specifically approved by the Appellate Division
and, as previously noted, COAH included
the asset test along with a companion
offset, which Dr. Angelides did not
include in his methodology, and which has
not been incorporated into the model endorsed
by this court. Consequently, the
court will include neither an asset test nor
its companion off-set step in its fair share
methodology, leaving the decision to incorporate
these policy changes for the future
when an agency better equipped to review
and balance new policy initiatives becomes
functional. This result is consistent with
the Supreme Court's admonition to the
trial courts to concentrate on accepted
methodologies and to avoid unnecessary
policy determinations better left to administrative
rulemaking. <EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU>,
221 N.J. at 29-30, 110 A.3d 31. Therefore,
the court will not adopt Dr. Angelides'
proposed asset test.

<CN>g. Aggregate Regional Prospective Need

<P20>The next step is to aggregate
LMI household growth during the Prospective
Need period to yield gross Prospective
Need by region, which will be
subsequently allocated to the municipalities
and adjusted for secondary sources.
Both experts followed COAH methodology
established in the Prior Rounds in this
step, reaching different results because of
their divergent
<SPage 149>
approaches in the earlier
steps. Included here are the statewide
and Region 4 values, calculated pursuant
to the methodology steps endorsed in this
decision:

<HN24>4. Allocate Prospective Need to municipalities

<P20>After gross Prospective Need
has been determined for the region in the
previous steps, that need must be allocated
to the municipalities in the Region. This
process translates the need into obligations
for each municipality by (1) identifying and
excluding Qualified Urban Aid Municipalities,
(2) measuring "responsibility" for affordable
housing need for each municipality,
(3) measuring "capacity" for affordable
housing need for each municipality, (4) averaging
regional shares of "responsibility"
and "capacity" factors to distribute LMI
housing need to municipalities, and (5) calculating
gross Prospective Need for each
municipality. Application of the allocation
factors determines the fair share obligation
for each municipality before application
of secondary sources. Through application
of the allocation factors, COAH
sought to target need to regions where
employment growth is taking place and to
localities with the financial ability and
available developable land to accommodate
new affordable housing. 26 N.J.R. 2302
(June 6, 1994). This allocation process once
again requires the court to select among
various datasets and divergent recommendations
from the experts. Notably, however,
none of these factors alter total need,
but govern how the need is allocated to
municipalities.
<SPage 150>

<CN>a. Identify and Exclude Qualified
Urban Aid Municipalities

<P20>COAH Prior Round methodologies excluded
a category of municipalities with
higher-than-average proportions of LMI
families living in fiscally/economically distressed
areas from additional LMI housing
requirements, known as Qualified Urban
Aid Municipalities ("QUAMs"), as designated
by the DCA. 26 N.J.R. 2346, 2352
(June 6, 1994) (codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93
app. A). To be designated as a QUAM, a
municipality must satisfy at least one of
three criteria: (1) a level of existing LMI
housing deficiency in excess of the average
LMI deficiency in its region, (2) a population
density in excess of 10,000 persons per
square mile, or (3) a population density
between 6,000 and 10,000 persons per
square mile and less than 5 percent vacant
(non-farm) land measured by the average
of the percentage of parcels and valuation
in the municipality. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>; <EMU>see also</EMU> 46
N.J.R. 952 (June 2, 2014).

<P20>Dr. Angelides excluded forty-two of the
fifty-eight QUAMs, while Dr. Kinsey exempted
forty-eight. Both experts identified
the same four Region 4 municipalities for
exemption: Trenton, Asbury Park, Long
Branch, and Lakewood. As a result, no
further discussion is warranted on this
point for Mercer County.

<P20>The formula for the allocation of regional
Prospective Need to non-exempted municipalities
in the Prior Rounds relied upon
a mix of what COAH characterized as
"responsibility" and "capacity" factors,
which reflect the economic and land use
<Page 554>
concerns referenced above. These factors
address whether a municipality can physically
accommodate growth in terms of
available developable land, and also evaluate
the financial ability of towns to address
affordable housing need. Once calculated
for each municipality, each factor is totaled
for the region, and each municipality is
assigned a percentage of that regional total.
The Second Round recognized three
allocation factors&mdash;one "responsibility" factor
and two "capacity" factors&mdash;which
were averaged for each municipality. Then
that percentage was applied to the regional
Prospective Need to determine each
municipality's share of regional need.
<SPage 151>

<CN>b. Calculate Responsibility Factor
for Each Municipality as a
Share of its Region

<P20>Responsibility factors represent
"measures of <EMU>responsibility</EMU>, <EMU>i.e.</EMU>, the labor
force either existing in the community or
drawn to the municipality in the future ...
needing housing." 26 N.J.R. 2346 (June 6,
1994) (codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A). In
essence, COAH sought to apportion affordable
housing obligations to municipalities
based in part on employment and anticipated
employment growth that generated
the need to house workers. While once
again this concept appears to be straightforward,
the absence of reliable data
proved problematic for COAH, and remains
problematic for this court.

<P20>COAH measured employment-generating
activities directly in the First Round,
using Department of Labor employment
statistics reported on a municipal basis.
This data source proved troublesome, however,
due to what has been identified as
the "zip code problem." It turned out that
the business mailing addresses used by the
Department of Labor did not always reflect
the actual municipality in which the
business is located. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> An example of
this phenomenon is that parts of South
Brunswick and Montgomery Townships
have a Princeton zip code, but are located
in Middlesex and Somerset Counties, respectively,
and not in Mercer County
where Princeton is located. So, employment
data collected by mailing address
was inaccurate for a number of municipalities.
In addition, employers often reported
total labor statistics from their headquarters,
combining employees working at different
locations, including at facilities in
other municipalities. This phenomenon became
known as the "headquarters problem,"
a reporting glitch that also inaccurately
skewed some municipal employment
data. As a result of these problems, a
number of municipalities challenged the
affordable housing obligations COAH allocated
to them in the First Round. After
confirming the assertions of some municipalities
that the employment data used in
the First Round had improperly been inflated,
leading to higher affordable housing
obligations than were warranted, COAH
reduced
<SPage 152>
the obligations of those towns.
As a result, many units included in municipal
need in the First Round were lost and
not replaced.

<P20>Not wanting to repeat this problem,
which had diluted statewide affordable
housing obligations, COAH sought a remedy
in the Second Round. It consequently
replaced the faulty direct measures of employment
and employment growth with a
single "change in equalized non-residential
property valuation," known as the "non-residential
valuation growth" factor, concluding
that, "[r]eal property valuation ...
has been found to be an excellent surrogate
for the intensity of use or number of
employees in the structure." 26 N.J.R.
2346 (June 6, 1994). COAH relied on data
collected and reported annually by the Division
of Local Government Services in the
NJDCA. As noted by COAH, "Equalized
valuation through the application of assessment-to-sales
<Page 555>
or equalization ratio is used
to standardize for the differing levels of
assessment relative to true or market values
that exist in an individual community."
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU> Dr. Kinsey incorporated the non-residential
valuation growth factor into his
methodology, essentially following COAH's
approach in the Second Round, but modifying
it to include growth from 1990
through 2015 because COAH had used
1990 data as the endpoint in the Second
Round.

<P20>Dr. Angelides disagreed with this approach,
concluding that the nonresidential
valuation surrogate was problematic due to
the lack of direct correlation between valuation
and employment density, the susceptibility
of the surrogate to non-employment
forces (<EMU>i.e.</EMU>, the real estate market), and
the arbitrary manner in which revaluations
and reporting are performed. Dr. Angelides
concluded that these issues rendered
the validity of the valuation surrogate suspect,
despite COAH's endorsement of the
approach in the Second Round. As a result,
Dr. Angelides replaced the non-residential
valuation growth factor in favor of
municipal employment data drawn from a
2013 dataset known as the Longitudinal
Employer-Household Dynamics Origin-Destination
Employment Statistics
("LODES"), a product developed by the
United States
<SPage 153>
Census Bureau, and apparently
used primarily for transportation
planning. According to Dr. Angelides,
LODES data, which was not available to
COAH during the Second Round, provided
direct employment data on a municipal
level and would accomplish the direct
measure that COAH had utilized in the
First Round, but allegedly without the zip
code or headquarters problems. Notably,
however, Dr. Angelides admitted that he
had simply incorporated LODES data for
the State and Mercer County into his model
without verifying its accuracy.

<P20>Dr. Kinsey not only urged the court to
follow the Second Round procedures as
more consistent with COAH practice, but
also challenged the reliability of the
LODES data used by Dr. Angelides because
of inaccuracies Dr. Kinsey claimed
are caused by the statistical techniques
employed to protect the confidentiality of
aspects of the data. While the court did not
fully understand what Dr. Kinsey characterized
as "noise" that was introduced into
the data collection process to protect employer
confidentiality, but which he
claimed had the effect of introducing inaccuracies
into the data, Dr. Kinsey presented
compelling evidence of specific instances
in Mercer County where LODES data
appeared to be erroneous. For example,
from 2012 to 2014, LODES employment
data in Hopewell Township in the health
care sector remained static although it is
well known that Capital Health opened a
large new hospital there during that period
with over 1500 employees. Ewing Township,
however, which adjoins Hopewell,
showed an increase of 1800 health care
jobs in the same time frame with no obvious
justification for that increase. LODES
data also showed an inexplicable drop in
Trenton employment from 2013 to 2014 of
over 25,000 jobs. LODES data for Ewing
over the past fifteen years also showed
significant swings of between 5,000 and
17,000 jobs in several years with no apparent
explanation.

<P20>Mr. Bernard confirmed COAH's experience
as summarized above, noting that the
Second Round had solved the zip code and
headquarters problems. Indeed, he testified
that no town objected to the application
of the responsibility factor based on
its non-residential
<SPage 154>
ratables, preventing
the dilution of need that had occurred in
the First Round. While he admitted that
non-residential ratables were an imperfect
surrogate for jobs, he asserted that such
ratables showed the fiscal capacity of a
<Page 556>
town to absorb affordable housing and operated
as a fair and effective surrogate on
this basis. He expressed concern that if
the court adopted the use of LODES data
as advocated by Dr. Angelides, municipalities
could petition the court for corrections
based on inaccuracies in the data, propelling
the court into the same dilemma faced
by COAH in the First Round.

<P20>Mr. Reading candidly admitted that neither
approach urged by the experts was
satisfactory. While he identified what he
termed a "disconnect" between job growth
and ratable growth, he was troubled by the
clear inaccuracies in the LODES data for
Mercer County. He agreed with Mr. Bernard,
however, that non-residential ratables
in a town are associated with a responsibility
to provide housing for the
workers employed there. Although Mr.
Reading liked the idea of a direct measure
of employment and thought LODES data
showed promise, he could not recommend
its use because it has never been validated
for New Jersey. He somewhat reluctantly
endorsed Dr. Kinsey's approach as being
generally consistent with COAH's procedure
in the Second Round.

<P20>The court once again is faced with a
choice between two imperfect and imprecise
alternatives. Notably, neither set of
statistics was developed for the purpose
for which it is being introduced into the
model: allocating affordable housing to municipalities
based on employment. Given
the clear inaccuracies in the LODES data
for Mercer County, however, the court
concurs with Mr. Reading's assessment
that the Second Round valuation surrogate
should continue to be used in this step, as
advocated by Dr. Kinsey and Mr. Bernard.
COAH made a policy choice in the Second
Round to replace the direct measures of
employment it had used to assess municipal
responsibility factors in the First
Round with a valuation surrogate, as the
solution to specific problems it identified.
That surrogate was used without apparent
<SPage 155>
objection in the Second Round, with the
advantage of directing need to municipalities
with nonresidential ratable growth.
Any reevaluation of COAH's Second
Round data choice to measure this responsibility
factor involves policy decisions best
left to an administrative agency that can
fully analyze the matter and explore alternatives
in a systematic way. While the
court would have considered changing datasets
if the Second Round valuation surrogate
was shown to be clearly defective
and a demonstrably superior alternative
was available, neither circumstance was
supported by the record here. The only
thing that is clear is that neither approach
is without shortcomings. As a result, the
court adopts Dr. Kinsey's methodology
that utilizes the Second Round single non-residential
valuation growth factor and will
leave the possible use of LODES data, or
another alternative, to a reconstituted
COAH in the future.

<CN>c. Calculate Capacity Factors for Each
Municipality as a Share of its
Region

<P20>Municipal "capacity" factors represent
"measures of <EM>capacity,</EM> <EMU>i.e.</EMU>, the physical
(land) and fiscal (income) capacity to absorb
and provide for [affordable] housing."
26 N.J.R. 2346 (June 6, 1994) (codified at
N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A). In the Second
Round, income capacity was determined
by measures of income differences between
the municipality and the region,
while "physical" capacity was based on an
analysis of the proportion of the region's
undeveloped land located within each municipality
that could accommodate development.

<CN>i. Income Capacity Factor

<P20>COAH changed the income capacity
factor calculation for the Second Round
<Page 557>
because the straightforward calculation of
a municipality's share of its regional aggregate
income in the First Round "tended
to give large middle-class municipalities an
overabundance of low- and moderate-income
housing need because they had a lot
of households with reasonably healthy incomes."
26 N.J.R. 2346 (June 6, 1994) (codified
at N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A). In its place,
the Second Round calculated the average
of two measures:
<SPage 156>

<B22>a. Municipal share of the regional
sum of the differences between median
1993 municipal household income and an
income floor ($100 below the lowest average
household income in the region),
and

<B22>b. Municipal share of the regional sum
of the differences between median 1993
municipal household incomes and an income
floor ($100 below the lowest 1993
median household income in the region)
weighted by the number of the households
in the municipality.

<B22>[26 N.J.R. 2346 (June 6, 1994) (codified
at N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A).]

<P20>By using household income differences
in municipalities rather than income, as
was used in the First Round, as well as
weighting, COAH sought to "dampen the
extremes of the straight-difference income
allocation index," utilized in the First
Round. In commenting on this change,
COAH noted that, "It is believed that the
procedure achieves both equity and more
incisive income targeting." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>Dr. Angelides adopted the Second
Round methodology, but with modifications
to correct what he saw as mathematical
errors regarding both the mixing of
median and mean in the first calculation,
and a statistically inappropriate use of medians
in the second. Dr. Kinsey followed
the Second Round methodology, utilizing
ACS 2010-2014 data to establish municipal
median and regional "floor" income levels.
Mr. Reading found that the differences
between the two methodologies had a minimal
effect on the allocation of need, and
recommended Dr. Kinsey's methodology
as adhering more closely to the Second
Round. Given the minimal impact on the
allocation of municipal affordable housing
need, Mr. Reading's endorsement of Dr.
Kinsey's approach, and its consistency
with the Second Round, the court adopts
Dr. Kinsey's approach for calculation of
the income capacity factor.

<CN>ii. Land Capacity Factor

<P20>The land capacity factor considers
undeveloped land in the community
that can accommodate development. The
complexity involved in this determination
derives in part from the fact that not all
vacant land is developable, and from the
shortcomings of the datasets used by the
experts. The Second Round estimated the
undeveloped land in municipalities utilizing
land satellite imagery
<SPage 157>
(LANDSAT),
which was compiled for COAH by Rutgers
University. 26 N.J.R. 2346 (June 6, 1994)
(codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A). The
undeveloped land was then weighted in
accordance with the "Planning Areas" in
the State Development and Redevelopment
Plan. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> COAH cross-checked the
undeveloped land by municipality with
data from The New Jersey Department of
Treasury, Division of Taxation, finding
that the LANDSAT data was "an excellent
and comprehensive source of land-use information."
COAH noted that the data
contained information for every municipality
in the State so that its strengths and
weaknesses applied equally to most municipalities,
making LANDSAT "a very comprehensive
and important source of undeveloped
land information especially good
for relative comparisons." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> Mr. Bernard
noted that COAH in the Second
Round was looking for a uniform and reliable
source of information and was satisfied
<Page 558>
that LANDSAT satisfied these concerns.

<P20>Dr. Kinsey followed COAH's Second
Round methodology, with certain revisions
to incorporate the updated 2001 State Development
and Redevelopment Plan, the
revised (2004) Meadowlands Master Plan,
and the land classifications in the 2008
Highlands Regional Master Plan. Reading
Rpt. (August 31, 2016), Ex. SM 4 at 57. Dr.
Kinsey also utilized updated "land use/land
cover data" from the New Jersey Department
of Environmental Protection's
(NJDEP) 2007 land use mapping product,
which was released in 2010 and was based
on work performed through a joint Rowan
University-Rutgers University initiative.
The major shortcoming of this procedure
was the age of the data used to apply this
factor in the Third Round, which started in
2015. Mr. Bernard did note, however, that
since the data was collected before the
start of the recession and New Jersey's
recovery had been slow, limited development
in recent years made the age of the
imagery less problematic than it would
have been had the recent past seen significant
development.

<P20>Dr. Angelides likewise followed the Second
Round by considering the allocation of
municipal shares of regional affordable
housing
<SPage 158>
need as the ratio of undeveloped
land in each municipality as a percentage
of that in the region. However, Dr. Angelides
expressed skepticism as to whether
vacant, undeveloped land could act as an
accurate measure of capacity as it does not
take into account repurposing of existing
non-residential buildings or demolition of
underutilized structures, which he concluded
biases development toward suburban
green field locations.

<P20>Dr. Angelides also expressed concern
that the 2007 NJDEP imagery was nine
years old at the time Dr. Kinsey prepared
his model, that it was of poor resolution,
and that the Rutgers/Rowan analysis was
not reproducible or verifiable. Thus, Dr.
Angelides deviated from the Second
Round by utilizing parcel-level tax assessment
data from the New Jersey Property
Tax System instead of land imagery to determine
potentially developable parcels in
each municipality. Dr. Angelides then accounted
for environmental restrictions and
state planning designations by overlaying
the tax assessment data with visual displays
of geographic data from the NJDEP
Bureau of Geographic Information Systems.
Dr. Angelides then applied a
weighting system based upon planning
designations from the Second Round to
undeveloped acreage that reflected its
conduciveness to development. The shortcomings
of this approach were that the
data contained inconsistencies and had
been shown to be incomplete, with up to
fifteen percent of local tax records lacking
the necessary data to establish the existence
of vacant and developable land. Dr.
Kinsey pointed to a glaring error in West
Windsor, where the data used by Dr. Angelides
showed that a property of over
ninety acres was not considered developable
because it had a small improvement on
the large parcel. That property is owned
by a developer that intervened in West
Windsor's declaratory judgment action
seeking to build affordable housing on
that property.

<P20>Mr. Reading concluded that, although
Dr. Angelides' reliance on municipal block
and lot classifications of land use instead of
aerial surveys could offer a more accurate
and up-to-date method, his approach depended
upon classifications performed by
individual
<SPage 159>
municipal assessors, and
therefore lacked statewide uniformity. Mr.
Reading further concluded that any inaccuracies
in the land imagery data due to
recent development could be addressed by
adjustments made in each town's compliance
<Page 559>
process. Mr. Reading once again recommended
Dr. Kinsey's methodology as it
conformed more closely to COAH's Second
Round methodology.

<P20>The court concurs with Mr. Reading's
assessment that, given yet another choice
between two imperfect alternatives, following
the Second Round approach is the best
option, especially since that approach relies
on data derived from a single consistent
source that can be corrected during
the compliance process. Moreover, the
court once again is hesitant to endorse a
new approach never validated or tested in
any way by COAH. The court therefore
adopts Dr. Kinsey's method for calculating
the land capacity factor.

<HN02>d. Average Regional Shares of "responsibility"
and "capacity" Factors and Allocate
Gross Prospective Need to
Each Municipality

<P20>Once the allocation factors are
determined, the next step is to calculate
the average allocation factor for each municipality.
In the Second Round, COAH
concluded that, "[a]ll factors operate individually,
are equally weighted, and involve
all municipalities in the region except Urban
Aid municipalities," with all allocations
derived from those factors "reflect[ing] the
fraction representing the community's
share of the regional total." 26 N.J.R. 2346
(June 6, 1994) (codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93
app. A). Drs. Angelides and Kinsey both
aggregated each of the factors they calculated
by region and determined each municipality's
share for each factor. They
then averaged the shares of each factor for
each municipality, yielding municipal proportional
shares of regional Prospective
Need. Since the court adopted Dr. Kinsey's
three "responsibility" and "capacity"
factors, gross Prospective Need will be
allocated to each municipality following
COAH's Second Round methodology,
based on the average share of Dr. Kinsey's
three factors. The resulting municipal
gross Prospective Need,
<SPage 160>
calculated pursuant
to this decision, is reflected in the
following chart:

<C5><EMU>Municipal Gross Prospective Need

  West Windsor       4.46%                669
</T>
<HN24>5. Adjust for Secondary Sources of
Supply and Demand

<P20>The next step in the Fair
Share methodology is to calculate each
municipality's secondary source adjustments
to apply to their gross Prospective
Need. Secondary sources represent the effect
of market forces on the supply of
affordable housing units not otherwise addressed
in the fair share methodology. According
to COAH's Second Round methodology,
applicable secondary sources are
demolitions, residential conversions, filtering,
and spontaneous conversions. 26
N.J.R. 2348-49 (June 6, 1994) (codified at
N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A). Calculations reflecting
these categories are applied to each
municipality's previously calculated gross
<Page 560>
Prospective Need, producing municipal
Prospective Need. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> And, unlike the
allocation of gross Prospective Need, "[i]n
the reductions or increases to housing
need due to secondary supply and demand,
all municipalities, including Urban
Aid locations, participate." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> COAH included
QUAMs in this step because "all
municipalities have some type of housing
need, and reductions apply to housing
need no matter how the need is generated."
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>Although COAH also included spontaneous
conversions in its adopted Round 3.1
rules, they were omitted in Round 3.2 and
Round 3.3, and both Drs. Angelides and
Kinsey adopted this approach. Dr. Angelides,
however, added a step not included in
the Prior Rounds by reallocating surplus
affordable housing credits from individual
municipalities back to the region to offset
the
<SPage 161>
remaining need of other municipalities.
As a result, the court will consider the
following secondary source adjustment
steps: (1) demolitions; (2) residential conversions;
(3) filtering; (4) reallocation of
secondary source adjustments (Angelides
proposal); and (5) calculation of Prospective
Need by Municipality.

<CN>a. Demolitions

<P20>"Demolitions are a secondary
source of housing demand ... created by
households requiring housing because
units are lost from stock." 26 N.J.R. 2348
(June 6, 1994) (codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93
app. A). This "selective pruning" of residential
housing units occurs for a variety
of reasons, such as damage from natural
causes, deterioration, redevelopment, or
abandonment. "In strong markets, demolitions
are low; in weaker markets, they are
proportionally higher." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> In both situations,
when housing units affordable to
LMI households are lost, their demolition
decreases the supply of affordable housing,
thus increasing affordable housing need.

<P20>In the Second Round, COAH calculated
an estimate of total demolitions in the six-year
Prospective Need period for each municipality
by averaging reported demolitions
for the three most recent years for
which municipal demolition data was available,
and then multiplying by six. N.J.A.C.
5:93-2.9. In determining the LMI share of
total municipal demolitions, COAH "recognize[d]
that demolitions take place at a
much higher rate in the low- and moderate-income
housing sector than for all
housing locally," 26 N.J.R. 2348-49 (June 6,
1994) (codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A),
further noting that:

<B22>Total demolitions are thus tallied by individual
community and the share affecting
low- and moderate-income housing is
estimated by a multiple of the subregional
low- and moderate-income housing
deficiency percentage.

<B22>[<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>]

<P00>To calculate the "multiple" in accordance
with the Second Round, and thus determine
the LMI share of total municipal
demolitions, COAH provided that:

<B22>Demolitions are adjusted for each municipality
to the share of all demolitions
that affect the low- and moderate-income
housing sector by 120 percent of
the
<SPage 162>
subregional share of low- and
moderate-income housing. This percentage
share of all demolitions that affects
low- and moderate-income families is
capped at 95 percent.

<B22>[<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>]

<P20>Dr. Kinsey utilized NJDCA demolition
data from 1999 through 2015 as the basis
to estimate total municipal demolitions
during the Prospective Need period but
adjusted the data for the effects of Hurricane
Sandy. Dr. Kinsey accounted for the
unusually high number of storm-related
demolitions by applying adjustments for
four Hurricane Sandy-impacted counties,
<Page 561>
based on the ratio of pre- and post-Sandy
demolitions. Then, Dr. Kinsey calculated
municipal LMI demolitions using each municipality's
share of the county's LMI
households. While Dr. Kinsey intended to
include COAH's Second Round multiplier
in his calculations, he expressed confusion
during cross-examination as to whether he
had actually incorporated the multiplier
into his spreadsheets, suggesting that any
omission on his part had been inadvertent.
He also used county rather than regional
incomes in preparing his calculations. Dr.
Kinsey's resulting estimate of LMI demolitions
in each municipality was aggregated
to yield 19,262 projected statewide demolitions
for the Prospective Need period of
2015-2025. Notably, Dr. Kinsey seemed uncharacteristically
unconcerned about any
possible deviations in his calculations from
COAH's approach to demolitions and made
no effort to clarify the procedure he actually
followed. Perhaps his attitude was
prompted by the small variation in demolitions
between his figures and those of Dr.
Angelides, which difference Mr. Reading
identified as less than five percent.

<P20>Dr. Angelides also used NJDCA data in
his methodology and adjusted for Hurricane
Sandy but deviated from Second
Round methodology by not applying
COAH's multiplier. Dr. Angelides calculated
average annual total demolitions by municipality
from 2000 to 2014 using NJDCA
data but excluding 2012 and 2013 statistics
to account for the high number of Hurricane
Sandy demolitions. Angelides Rpt.
(May 16, 2016), Ex. P 2 at 70-71. Dr.
Angelides incorporated additional data
from a report produced by the United
States Department of Housing and Urban
Development
<SPage 163>
called Components of Inventory
Change ("CINCH"). COAH never
used that dataset in analyzing demolitions.

<P20>Not being comfortable with COAH's approach
to demolitions, Dr. Angelides decided
to "update" COAH's methodology by
using CINCH data to exclude certain categories
of demolished units. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> Dr. Angelides
deducted from total demolitions
unoccupied units, units not occupied by
LMI households, demolitions of seasonal
units, and demolitions of any deficient
units that would already have been accounted
for under traditional Present
Need. The resulting estimate of occupied,
non-deficient LMI demolitions in each municipality
was aggregated to yield 18,653
projected statewide demolitions for the
Prospective Need period of 2015-2025. Notably,
neither expert followed COAH's
Round 3.3 approach of aggregating municipal
data to produce a statewide total demolition
figure from 2000 through 2009 and
then taking 19.5 percent of that number to
add to the housing need for the Prospective
Need period. 46 N.J.R. 986 (June 2,
2014).

<P20>Special Master Reading endorsed Dr.
Angelides' approach because he concluded
that it was more detailed and precise, and
because it better identified "the number of
demolitions of non-vacant, non-seasonal,
recently occupied, occupied and affordable
to LMI households, and which are not
deficient." Reading Rpt. (August 31, 2016),
Ex. SM 4 at 63. However, Mr. Reading
recommended that adjustments for Hurricane
Sandy be made by utilizing NJDCA
demolition data for all counties prior to
2012, thereby excluding all post-Sandy
data. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> Although Mr. Reading acknowledged
that Prior Rounds did not reduce
demolition estimates for deficient and
unoccupied dwellings, he based his support
for this reduction on the much better data
available today than twenty-five years ago.
Mr. Reading also remarked that, as noted
above, despite using divergent approaches,
the estimates of Drs. Angelides and Kinsey
for LMI demolitions yielded a statewide
difference of less than five percent:
<Page 562>

<C5><EMU>Aggregated LMI Demolitions (2015-2025)</EMU>

  Dr. Angelides     +4,168       +18,653

  Dr. Kinsey        +4,509       +19,262
</T>
<B22>[Reading Rpt. (April 24, 2017), Ex. SM 1
at 40-43.]

<P20>Although Mr. Reading preferred what
he deemed to be the more precise approach
utilized by Dr. Angelides, the court
is concerned that such a methodology deviates
significantly from COAH's approach
in the Second Round and would require
the court to make the kind of policy judgments
disfavored by the Supreme Court.
In the Second Round, COAH was clear
that estimates of demolitions for the Prospective
Need period would be based upon
past total demolitions that were increased
by a calculated multiplier, recognizing&mdash;as
noted above&mdash;that demolitions occur at a
much higher rate for LMI units than for
all housing. 26 N.J.R. 2348-49 (June 6,
1994) (codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A).
Most persuasively, however, COAH in Prior
Rounds made no mention whatsoever of
excluding unoccupied and deficient units
from its calculation of demolitions. Nor did
COAH ever limit demolitions to units occupied
by LMI households, as Mr. Bernard
testified. While CINCH data may at some
point be used by a reconstituted COAH for
this step, it is noteworthy that COAH
made no mention of it in any of the iterations
of the Third Round rules that it
drafted. Nor did any of the iterations of
the Third Round rules exclude the categories
of units deducted by Dr. Angelides.
While it is noteworthy that Dr. Angelides
&mdash;without using a multiplier&mdash;produced
an estimate close to that endorsed
by Dr. Kinsey, who more closely followed
the Second Round approach, the bottom
line is simply that Dr. Angelides deviated
from the Second Round without convincing
the court that it was necessary to do so.
And since that deviation excludes units
incorporated by COAH, Dr. Angelides' approach
involves policy decisions that the
court prefers to leave to administrative
consideration.
<SPage 165>
Consequently, the court
rejects the modifications urged by Dr. Angelides.

<P20>The court, however, does endorse the
recommendation of Mr. Reading that all
post-Sandy data be excluded from the averaging
process. Higher than normal demolitions
occurred in more than the four
counties identified by Dr. Kinsey and for
more years than the two excluded by Dr.
Angelides as a result of Hurricane Sandy.
The better approach to making an adjustment
for the very high number of demolitions
in the wake of that disaster is thus to
remove all post-Sandy demolition data
from the calculation of demolitions for the
Prospective need period. Moreover, given
Dr. Kinsey's uncertainty about his close
adherence to the Second Round in his
calculation of demolitions, the court instructed
Mr. Reading to follow COAH's
Second Round approach, utilizing the
COAH multiplier, but also incorporating
the adjustment for Sandy data he recommended.
In addition, while Dr. Kinsey
used county income data in this step, the
court directs Mr. Reading to use regional
LMI income data. Although COAH never
<Page 563>
defined what it meant by "subregional" in
its approach to calculating demolitions,
N.J.A.C. 5:93-2.9, other steps in the methodology
use regional and not county incomes
and the court has determined that
regional income data should be used in this
step for consistency. As a result, the court
will incorporate into its statewide model
total demolitions during the Prospective
Need period calculated by Mr. Reading of
23,835 statewide and 4,947 for Region 4.
For Princeton the number of demolitions
is eighty-seven, and for West Windsor the
figure is fifty-three.

<CN>b. Residential conversions

<P20>While demolitions increase affordable
housing need, residential conversions
represent the creation of new residential
units that COAH expected would reduce
affordable housing need. "Residential conversion
is the creation of dwelling units
from already existing residential structures"
that reduces municipal need. 26
N.J.R. 2320, 2349 (June 6, 1994) (codified
at N.J.A.C. 5:93-2.11). Most conversions
result from the creation of multiple smaller
units
<SPage 166>
from larger existing units, and
"[a]lmost all conversion consists of additional
dwelling units being created from
other residential units, and very rarely
from nonresidential units." 26 N.J.R. 2349
(June 6, 1994). COAH described the relationship
between demolitions and conversions
in the Second Round:

<B22>Residential conversions to low- and moderate-income
housing in normal markets
are often on a par with demolitions for
the low- and moderate-income sector. In
stronger markets, conversions are more
than demolitions; in weaker markets,
less.

<B22>[<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>]

<P00>COAH further explained that because residential
conversions are closely related to
the municipal percentage of two- to four-family
structures, conversions are calculated
at the regional level and then allocated
to municipalities in proportion to their regional
share of two- and four-family dwellings.
26 N.J.R. 2320, 2349 (June 6, 1994)
(codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93-2.11).

<P20>Residential conversions cannot be directly
measured but are evidenced by the
"unexplained difference" between the units
measured at the beginning and end of a
period that cannot be accounted for by
building permits minus demolitions. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
In both the adopted Round 3.2 rules and
the un-adopted Round 3.3 rules, COAH
clarified this step by providing a clear
mathematical formula to estimate conversions,
and changed the indicia of housing
construction from building permits, which
were used in the Second Round, to certificates
of occupancy:

<B22>This methodology ... defines residential
conversions as the change in total units
minus the difference between new construction
(as indicated by certificates of
occupancy) and demolitions (as indicated
by demolition permits).

<B22>[46 N.J.R. 985-86 (June 2, 2014).]

<P00>Notably, however, neither expert used
COAH's Third Round approach, but tried
to follow COAH's Second Round to the
extent they could discern that methodology.

<P20>As with demolitions, COAH recognized
in the Second Round that "on a percentage
basis, a greater share of residential conversion
units flows to the lowand moderate-income
population than to the population
as a whole," <EMU>id.</EMU> at 2349, but failed to
designate a specific multiplier to calculate
conversions, differing from its approach
<SPage 167>
to demolitions in the Second Round. Given
some ambiguity in COAH's Second Round
approach, and the absence of a multiplier,
Drs. Angelides and Kinsey defaulted to the
multiplier formula in the Second Round
used for demolitions but selected different
<Page 564>
datasets to use in their calculations. Dr.
Angelides went on to calculate the change
in "occupied housing" using certificates of
occupancy to represent construction activity,
while Dr. Kinsey utilized building permits.
Reading Rpt. (August 31, 2016), Ex.
SW 4 at 63-69.

<P20>Dr. Angelides calculated the regional
change in occupied housing units by county
between 2000 and 2010, using decennial
census data, and then aggregated the data
to the appropriate region. Dr. Angelides
measured construction activity at the municipal
level for that period using certificates
of occupancy reported by NJDCA,
concluding that they were a more reliable
metric of completed residential construction
activity than building permits, which
might not result in actual construction in a
given year. Dr. Angelides likewise drew
municipal demolition figures from NJDCA
data, and aggregated both construction activity
and demolition activity to the regional
level to determine residential conversions.
Dr. Angelides then allocated the
regional conversion activity to municipalities
in proportion to their share of regional
two- and four-family dwellings, utilizing
2009-2013 ACS data. Finally, Dr. Angelides
calculated the proportion of LMI conversion
activity for each municipality by
utilizing 120 percent of the proportion of
households qualifying as LMI within each
county, and then projecting annualized
conversion activity, by municipality, into
the Prospective Need period. Dr. Angelides
estimated 2,025 LMI conversions in
Region 4 and 11,662 statewide LMI conversions
for the Prospective Need period
based on this approach.

<P20>Dr. Kinsey calculated the regional
change in total housing units at the county
level, using 2000 decennial census and 2014
Population and Housing Unit Estimates
data. Dr. Kinsey measured construction
activity for the same period using municipal
building
<SPage 168>
permits reported by
NJDCA, but adjusted for the effects of
Hurricane Sandy as he did when calculating
demolitions in the previous step. Dr.
Kinsey then derived municipal demolitions
from NJDCA data, aggregating both construction
activity and demolition activity to
the regional level to determine residential
conversions. Dr. Kinsey then allocated the
regional conversion activity to municipalities
in proportion to their share of regional
two- and four-family dwellings in 2012, using
2010-2014 ACS data, and estimated the
LMI share of conversions based on 120
percent of the proportion of households
qualifying as LMI within each county,
capped at ninety-five percent, and then
projected annualized conversion activity,
by municipality, into the Prospective Need
period. Dr. Kinsey's calculations yielded a
loss of 1,375 units in Region 4, and a loss
of 2,068 units statewide due to residential
conversions, which he attributed to the
increased pricing of the converted units.
The following chart demonstrates a comparison
of the results recommended by
each expert:

<C5><EMU>Impact of Aggregated LMI Conversions

                   <EMU>Region 4</EMU>     <EMU>New Jersey</EMU>

  Dr. Angelides     -2,025        -11,662

  Dr. Kinsey        +1,375        +2,068
</T>
<Page 565>

<P20>Special Master Reading endorsed the
use of certificates of occupancy to represent
building activity for the calculation of
residential conversions. Reading Rpt.
(April 24, 2017), Ex. SM 1 at 47. Mr.
Reading testified that economic conditions
affecting construction activity between
2000 and 2010&mdash;which includes the onset of
the Great Recession&mdash;made building permits
a less reliable indicator of housing
construction than certificates of occupancy.
He noted that, during this period, there
were two building permits issued for every
housing unit ultimately occupied, and that
the State government issued two building
permit extensions in
<SPage 169>
response to the
effect on construction caused by the economic
downturn. Mr. Reading concluded,
therefore, that certificates of occupancy
were a much better indicator of construction
activity than building permits in the
Third Round. Moreover, Mr. Reading was
disturbed by the results of Dr. Kinsey's
approach, which added units to need when
COAH had always used conversions to reduce
need. Mr. Reading believed that Dr.
Kinsey's reliance on building permits to
measure construction activity was a primary
reason for the questionable results
recommended by Dr. Kinsey.

<P20>The court concurs with Mr. Reading
that certificates of occupancy provide a
better indicia of housing construction for
this step, especially given the economic
downturn that affected the data available
to the experts for the calculation of conversions.
Moreover, COAH recognized the superiority
of using certificates of occupancy
in determining conversions in its adopted
Round 3.2 rules and continued that approach
in Round 3.3. Whether or not Dr.
Kinsey's use of building permits skewed
his analysis, his results are inconsistent
with COAH's past observations that residential
conversions should reduce municipal
affordable housing need.

<P20>Although FSHC and the NJBA questioned
the reliability of certificates of occupancy
by presenting evidence of individual
instances where municipalities did not accurately
report and track them, the practice
did not appear to be widespread. Presumably,
those minor anomalies were
known to COAH when it endorsed the use
of certificates of occupancy in Rounds 3.2
and 3.3. When weighed against the shortcomings
of building permits to reflect actual
construction activity, certificates of occupancy
emerge as more reliable despite the
anomalies cited by defendants. In addition,
Dr. Angelides' residential conversion values
not only decrease affordable housing
need, consistent with past COAH practice,
but are also less than both his and Dr.
Kinsey's demolition values, which COAH
anticipated would be the case in a weak
housing market. The court thus adopts Dr.
Angelides' approach for the calculation of
residential conversions as the best alternative
based
<SPage 170>
on the trial record. His data
will be included in the court's model, reducing
affordable housing need by 11,662
statewide.

<CN>c. Filtering

<P20>Filtering is a secondary source adjustment
that has proven controversial in the
past and remains controversial in the
Third Round. As noted above, Mr. Bernard
endorsed most of Dr. Kinsey's model
except for filtering, as did Judge Wolfson.
<EMU>In re Township of South Brunswick</EMU>, 448
N.J. Super. at 464, 153 A.3d 981.

<P20>Calculating filtering is an extremely
complicated process involving
many variables. Days of testimony were
devoted to each expert's attempt to explain
and justify their models and the results
they produced, although Dr. Kinsey was
skeptical about the reliability of either
model and questioned consideration of filtering
altogether as part of the fair share
<Page 566>
model. Two types of filtering are proposed
for inclusion in the current methodology.
Downward filtering reduces affordable
housing need and occurs when middle or
upper income households vacate a housing
unit, which then becomes affordable to
LMI households. Upward filtering increases
affordable housing need and occurs
when a formerly affordable housing unit
rises in value beyond the reach of LMI
households. In prior rounds, downward filtering
predominated, with COAH recognizing
filtering as the most significant market
force in reducing housing need. <EMU>In re
Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:94 & 5:95</EMU>, 390 N.J.
Super. at 24, 914 A.2d 348. Although
COAH maintained that filtering takes
place in all locations to some degree,
COAH asserted that it is found more often
in urban and older suburban areas with
higher percentages of multifamily houses
than in newer suburban areas. 26 N.J.R.
2349 (June 6, 1994).

<P20>As the filtering concept evolved, COAH
identified its prerequisite market conditions.
In the Second Round, COAH described
filtering as "a downward adjustment
of housing" that was "predicated on
the existence of housing surpluses, which
cause housing prices to drop because of
the excess of housing supply over
<SPage 171>
demand." 26 N.J.R. 2349 (June 6, 1994)
(codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A); N.J.A.C.
5:93-2.10. In response to comments on the
Second Round methodology, COAH identified
five conditions that must exist for
filtering to occur: (1) an overall housing
surplus; (2) a surplus of new housing construction
over new household formation;
(3) no major non-price barriers, such as
discrimination, that limit mobility among
low-income households; (4) moderate operating
costs for newly built units; and (5) a
limited number of poor households. <EMU>In re
Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:94 & 5:95</EMU>, 390 N.J.
Super. at 42, 914 A.2d 348 (accepting
COAH's five conditions for the existence of
filtering in New Jersey, citing 36 N.J.R.
5801-03 (Dec. 20, 2004)). While the Appellate
Division had upheld COAH's First
Round filtering methodology because the
legislative scheme was novel, and the implementation
of its goals was an evolving
process, <EMU>id.</EMU> at 44, 914 A.2d 348 (citing <EMU>Van
Dalen v. Washington Township</EMU>, 120 N.J.
234, 246, 576 A.2d 819 (1990)), the court's
deference to COAH ultimately yielded to
closer scrutiny.

<P20>Seventeen years later, the Appellate Division
rejected COAH's use of filtering and
the resulting reductions in Prospective
Need it had incorporated into the adopted
Round 3.1 rules, questioning the reasonableness
of the data COAH relied upon.
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 41, 44-45, 914 A.2d 348. Notably, in
rejecting COAH's application of filtering in
Round 3.1, the Appellate Division declared
that, "the legislative scheme is no longer
novel and COAH has had ample time to
test its opinion that filtering substantially
reduces the need for affordable housing in
New Jersey." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 44, 914 A.2d 348.

<P20>The Appellate Division found that
COAH had not adequately demonstrated
the existence of filtering according to the
five conditions it had previously articulated,
finding as well that the survey data
used in the calculations did not represent
"the most recent and reliable data available."
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 46, 914 A.2d 348. The Appellate
Division did not, however, invalidate
filtering as a secondary source altogether,
but required that "[o]n remand, COAH
must consider more recent data relevant to
whether the five conditions for filtering
currently exist in New Jersey, as well
<SPage 172>
as any other data supplied by the interested
parties." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> In response to this
decision, COAH developed a new filtering
model with the assistance of Econsult, the
firm retained by the municipalities to assist
them in this litigation. <EMU>See</EMU> N.J.A.C.
5:97 app. A at 97. Notably, however, the
<Page 567>
Appellate Division did not address that
model's validity when it rejected COAH's
Growth Share approach in Round 3.2. <EMU>In
re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 & 5:97</EMU>, 416
N.J. Super. at 511-12, 6 A.3d 445.

<P20>Dr. Angelides was skeptical that the five
prerequisite conditions were valid indicators
of the existence of filtering, but provided
brief justifications as to why each
was satisfied. Angelides Rpt. (May 16,
2016), Ex. P 2 at 76. He then went on to
explain that his econometric approach to
filtering was composed of a three-step process:
(1) collect data for 2000-2014 housing
transactions, combined with census income
data and housing stock to measure historic
filtering; (2) create a model to determine
the geographic probability of filtering; and
(3) apply the model to municipalities to
estimate future filtering. Dr. Angelides'
methodology produced a downward filtering
of 30,187 units statewide, reducing affordable
housing need by that number.

<P20>Dr. Kinsey asserted that there was no
court-approved methodology for calculating
or projecting filtering in New Jersey
and questioned the existence of filtering.
Kinsey Rpt. (May 17, 2016), Ex. DF 2 at
61. He presented extensive evidence challenging
the existence of each of COAH's
five conditions. Kinsey Rpt. (May 17,
2016), Ex. DF 58 at 182-200. Nevertheless,
Dr. Kinsey developed an approach based
on the methodology Econsult had developed
for COAH, but with significant modifications
and the addition of a separate
analysis to differentiate rental units from
the for-sale market. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 62. Dr. Kinsey's
methodology produced an upward filtering
of 30,047 units statewide, meaning that
affordable housing need was increased by
that number in his model. The following
chart shows a comparison of the results of
the two filtering models presented to the
court:

<C5><EMU>Aggregated LMI Filtering (2015-2025)</EMU>

  Difference:        10,107        67,651
</T>
<P20>Special Master Reading rejected both
Dr. Angelides' and Dr. Kinsey's filtering
approaches because they included "an
abundance of adjustments, probabilities,
likelihoods, and extrapolations" that he
concluded were unreliable. Reading Rpt.
(April 24, 2017), Ex. SM 1 at 56. Given the
extreme divergence between the estimates
prepared by the experts and absent a convincing
demonstration of their reliability,
Mr. Reading recommended that filtering
not be included in the determination of fair
share obligations in the Third Round,
agreeing with both Mr. Bernard and Judge
Wolfson on this issue.

<P20>Likewise, Mr. Bernard did not support
the use of either expert's filtering approach.
Mr. Bernard concluded that Dr.
Angelides' approach was analogous to what
had already been rejected
<SPage 174>
by the Appellate
Division in <EMU>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C.
5:94 & 5:95</EMU>, 390 N.J. Super. at 42-46, 914
A.2d 348, in that it represented an extremely
complicated statistical construct
that supposedly demonstrated downward
<Page 568>
filtering effects at the regional and local
levels, while there was census data demonstrating
the opposite. And although he
agreed with the general upward direction
of filtering reflected in Dr. Kinsey's data,
Mr. Bernard also rejected his approach
because it was equally as complicated as
that of Dr. Angelides, not transparent, and
contained questionable assumptions.

<P20>The court concurs with the recommendations
of Mr. Reading and Mr. Bernard,
and the ruling of Judge Wolfson on this
issue, and rejects including filtering adjustments
in the Third Round fair share
methodology. First and foremost, the court
is not convinced that either expert satisfactorily
addressed the concerns expressed by
the Appellate Division in <EMU>In re Adoption of
N.J.A.C. 5:94 & 5:95</EMU>, 390 N.J. Super. at
42-46, 914 A.2d 348. In that case, appellants
argued that COAH relied on flawed
data to conclude that filtering was occurring,
and the Appellate Division agreed,
citing a failure of COAH to demonstrate in
the record that housing was becoming
more affordable and directing COAH, on
remand, to substantiate the five filtering
conditions with recent relevant data. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>Here, even Dr. Angelides, a proponent
of filtering adjustments, nonetheless expressed
some skepticism as to the validity
of COAH's five filtering conditions. While
presenting a filtering model to the court,
he provided scant statistical evidence to
accompany anecdotal indications that
COAH's conditions had been satisfied. Angelides
Rpt. (May 16, 2016), Ex. P2 at 76-77.
By contrast, Dr. Kinsey countered with
credible testimony providing a detailed
analysis challenging each filtering condition
utilizing source documentation from
COAH and other data to support each
point, yet he proceeded to advocate including
his filtering approach in his fair share
model. Kinsey Rpt. (May 17, 2016), Ex. DF
58 at 182-200. Mr. Bernard also expressed
skepticism regarding the existence of filtering,
based on census data indicating
that housing has become less affordable
statewide. The record in this case thus
provides the court with little confidence
that filtering is occurring in New Jersey
or, even if it is, that it can be measured in
a reliable manner.

<P20>The results advocated by the parties
also are troubling to the court. Notably,
Dr. Angelides' approach produced a number
of filtered housing units that were
valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars
above COAH's maximum LMI qualifying
incomes, <EMU>id.</EMU> at 171-74, and Dr. Kinsey's
approach yielded a significant net upward
filtering, despite COAH's observations in
the Prior Rounds that filtering generally
could be expected to reduce housing need.
Consequently, the court has no confidence
that either approach is reasonable or reliable
and thus will not include filtering as a
secondary source adjustment in its fair
share methodology.
<SPage 175>

<P20>After addressing all of the steps discussed
above, the court directed Mr. Reading
to calculate municipal secondary source
adjustments to reflect this court's rulings,
and also directed him to aggregate all of
the results to the State level for illustrative
purposes. The results are listed below
with the recommendations of the experts
included for the sake of comparison:

<CN>d. Reallocation of Secondary
Source Adjustments

<P20>Dr. Angelides testified that
COAH's Second Round methodology was
defective due to what he called the "zero
bound" flaw, whereby credit for excess
affordable housing in individual municipalities
is effectively lost because it is not
pooled and reallocated to other municipalities
in the region. According to Dr. Angelides,
COAH calculated secondary source
adjustments in the Second Round by region
and allocated them down to individual
municipalities, which can result in a net
negative need. Angelides Rpt. (May 16,
2016), Ex. P 2 at 82-83. Such negative need
could occur when the number of housing
units created through conversions and filtering
is greater than the need for units
created by demolitions and filtering. Dr.
Angelides noted that once this secondary
source negative need is allocated to the
municipalities, it is applied first against
any Prospective Need the municipality
may have, and then against municipal
Present Need. Dr. Angelides pointed out
that a municipality could have a secondary
source negative need that is larger than
the sum of its Prospective Need and Present
Need, meaning that the municipality
has more affordable housing than
<SPage 176>
its
fair share of the region's affordable housing
need. Dr. Angelides noted that, under
COAH's Second Round practice, a net negative
need (excess available affordable
housing) is not otherwise accounted for
and is set to zero. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> Dr. Angelides
argued that instead of being zeroed out
and lost, municipal negative need should
be aggregated back to the region, pooled,
and reallocated to offset the remaining
affordable housing need of the region's
other municipalities. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> Dr. Angelides'
secondary source reallocation step would
add over 30,000 units of affordable housing
statewide, decreasing the need by that
number. Under Dr. Angelides' approach,
over 5,500 additional affordable housing
units would be reallocated to Region 4.

<P20>Notably, however, any excess municipal
affordable housing (negative need) is not
lost but can be credited in future fair share
rounds in the compliance process. Mr. Bernard
testified that, in the Prior Rounds,
municipalities with surplus housing units
from a previous round were credited with
those units in the subsequent round. Indeed,
the Second Round rules state that,
"[t]he reduction for prior-cycle activities is
subtracted from Pre-credited Need; it cannot
reduce Pre-credited Need below zero.
Any unexpended reduction is carried over
to the next cycle." 26 N.J.R. 2350 (June 6,
1994). And in fact, in Mercer County settlements
reviewed by this court, some municipalities
are using excess credits from
the past toward satisfaction of their Third
Round obligations, consistent with past
COAH practice.
<Page 570>

<P20>Thus, the court concludes that any surplus
affordable housing units in individual
municipalities can be utilized in subsequent
fair share rounds so that there is no need
to deviate from prior COAH practice and
reallocate any surplus here. Also, the addition
of a secondary source reallocation step
to the fair share methodology is the type
of policy decision that is better left to an
administrative agency that can thoroughly
review any such change through rulemaking.
This court therefore declines to adopt
Dr. Angelides' secondary source reallocation.
The court does note, however, that
<SPage 177>
Dr. Angelides' results for this proposal
were greatly affected by incorporation of
his filtering model, which was also rejected
by the court.

<CN>e. Calculate Prospective Need
by Municipality

<P20>The next step in calculating
Prospective Need is to adjust each municipality's
gross Prospective Need to reflect
secondary source adjustments of supply
and demand. Having excluded filtering
from this adjustment, the court&mdash;following
Prior Round methodology&mdash;directed Mr.
Reading to calculate municipal Prospective
Need by taking the sum of each town's
allocated share of gross Prospective Need
and its LMI demolitions, minus its share
of conversions. Municipal Prospective
Need calculated pursuant to this decision
produced the following results:

<C5><EMU>Municipal Prospective Need 2015 &mdash; 2025</EMU>
<T>
                 <EMU>Gross Prosp.</EMU>     <EMU>S.S. Adjust.</EMU>     <EMU>Prosp. Need</EMU>
                      <EMU>Need</EMU>

    Princeton         333               +32              365

  West Windsor        669               +38              707
</T>
<P20>Following adjustments for secondary
sources, the final step in determining Prospective
Need in the fair share methodology
would be to calculate and apply the
twenty percent cap to each municipality's
gross Prospective Need before it is added
to municipal Prior Round Obligations and
Present Need. <EMU>See</EMU> 26 N.J.R. 2350-51 (June
6, 1994) (codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93 app. A).
However, discussion and application of the
twenty percent cap is related to the calculation
of Gap Present Need and the court's
determination concerning how the cap will
be applied. Consequently, having concluded
its analysis of Phase 1 of the trial
focusing largely on Prospective Need for
the Third Round, the court now turns to
addressing a model to calculate the affordable
housing need that arose during the
gap period of 1999-2015.
<SPage 178>

<CN>V. Gap Present Need/Phase 2

<HN02>A. Gap Present Need Factual and Procedural
History

<P20>In the Ocean County proceeding to determine
the methodology for establishing
the fair share affordable housing obligations
for thirteen Ocean County municipalities,
the Honorable Mark A. Troncone,
J.S.C., raised the issue of whether Third
Round housing obligations should include
the need that arose from the expiration of
the Second Round rules in 1999 to the date
in 2015 by which towns were required to
file declaratory judgment actions to demonstrate
constitutional compliance and to
obtain immunity from builders' remedy
lawsuits. <EMU>See Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at
516, 152 A.3d 915. This period has become
known as the "gap," representing the six-teen
years in which COAH did not adopt a
full set of Third Round rules that passed
constitutional muster. The Ocean County
<Page 571>
municipalities, joined by the League of
Municipalities, argued to Judge Troncone
that fair share obligations could only fall
into the two well-defined components of
Present Need and Prospective Need,
claiming that since any gap need fell out-side
of these categories, establishing a fair
share for this period would violate the
FHA. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> FSHC, NJBA, and private developers
opposed this argument and joined
in asserting that gap need must be captured
as part of a town's affordable housing
obligation. <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at
516-17, 152 A.3d 915.

<P20>The same experts who submitted reports
regarding Prospective Need provided
reports to Judge Troncone and to
court-appointed Special Master Reading,
analyzing whether and then how gap need
could be calculated as part of a municipality's
Third Round fair share obligation. The
League of Municipalities' expert, Dr. Angelides,
asserted that there was no "legally
defined obligation" to address gap need for
the Third Round cycle, while Mr. Bernard,
on behalf of NJBA, claimed that COAH's
regulations, as well as the reality of affordable
housing need in New Jersey, mandated
that the gap need be included in a
Prospective Need analysis. <EMU>Mount Laurel
V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 517, 152 A.3d 915 FSHC's
expert, Dr. Kinsey, contended that
COAH's regulations and applicable case
<SPage 179>
law required including the gap period
need in the Third Round, either separately
or as part of the Prospective Need component,
which he asserted spanned the entire
period from 1999 to 2025. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> Special
Master Reading reviewed all of the submitted
reports and recommended to Judge
Troncone that gap period need should be
calculated as a "separate and discrete"
methodology unique to the gap period,
rather than as part of Prospective Need.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>On February 18, 2016, Judge Troncone
issued an opinion concluding that the housing
need that arose during the gap period
must be included as part of the Third
Round fair share obligation in order to
satisfy constitutional requirements. Judge
Troncone also held that gap period need
was not part of Prospective Need but
should be calculated as a "separate and
discrete component" of need, based on actual
growth during the 1999-2015 period,
rather than on future projections. <EMU>See
Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 518-19, 152
A.3d 915 (summarizing the proceedings before
the trial court in Ocean County). The
Township of Barnegat appealed Judge
Troncone's ruling that a gap period component
must be included in the Third Round.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU> The Appellate Division, at the direction
of the Supreme Court, expedited
the appellate proceedings after the Court
denied FSHC's emergent application for
direct certification. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>On July 11, 2016, the Appellate Division
issued its ruling, captioned <EMU>In re Declaratory
Judgment Actions filed by Various
Municipalities, County of Ocean</EMU>, 446 N.J.
Super. 259, 141 A.3d 359 (App. Div. 2016)
("<EMU>Ocean County Appeal</EMU>"), which found that
there was no basis in the FHA or otherwise
to require municipalities to retroactively
calculate a new "separate and discrete"
affordable housing obligation during
the gap period. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 267-68, 141 A.3d 359.
The Appellate Division grounded its decision
in <EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU> and the FHA and
viewed the creation of a "separate and
discrete" gap component as over-reaching
policymaking best left to the Legislative
and Executive branches. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> In rejecting
Judge Troncone's approach to the retrospective
calculation of the
<SPage 180>
need that
arose during this period, however, the Appellate
Division emphasized that some gap
period need could be captured in a municipality's
calculation of Present Need. <EMU>Ocean</EMU>
<Page 572>
<EMU>County Appeal</EMU>, 446 N.J. Super. at 295, 141
A.3d 359.

<P20>FSHC moved to stay the decision pending
expedited review by the Supreme
Court, which the Appellate Division denied
on July 18, 2016. FSHC then applied to
the Supreme Court for leave to appeal and
a stay, both of which were ultimately
granted on September 8, 2016. Barnegat
remained the only municipality involved in
the appeal insofar as it challenged the
obligation to account for any need that
arose during the gap period. <EMU>Mount Laurel
V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 520-21, 152 A.3d 915. On
January 18, 2017, during the pendency of
the Mercer County methodology trial, the
Supreme Court affirmed and modified the
Appellate Division's decision, ordering that
gap period affordable housing need be included
as part of the fair share component
of Present Need, in what has become
known as <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 513-14,
152 A.3d 915.

<P20>In response to <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, on January
31, 2017, this court added a Gap
Present Need phase to the methodology
trial and scheduled it to follow the conclusion
of the "Prospective Need" phase, already
in progress. The court again directed
the experts to develop, exchange, and
submit methodology reports to Mr. Reading
and to the court. Given the guidance
provided by the Supreme Court, this court
urged the parties to work together in fashioning
a mutually acceptable methodology
to address the calculation of Gap Present
Need. Unfortunately, the parties resisted
the court's efforts, appearing to be too
invested in their own methodological paradigms
to embrace a joint approach. The
challenges presented by crafting a model
to determine Gap Present Need are underscored
by the continually evolving positions
of the experts, starting with their
submissions to Judge Troncone and continuing
through the testimony and evidence
presented at the Mercer County
methodology trial. <EMU>See also Mount Laurel
V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at
<SPage 181>
522, 152 A.3d 915 (noting
how arguments regarding gap need had
evolved throughout the proceedings before
Supreme Court).

<P20>Dr. Kinsey testified that he felt bound to
follow the same approach for Gap Present
Need that he had utilized for determining
Prospective Need. To support this approach,
he cited COAH's use of Prospective
Need methodology when it recalculated
the fair share obligations assigned to
municipalities in the First Round when
they proved to be too high. COAH called
this process Prior-Cycle Prospective
Need, described at N.J.A.C. 5:93-1.3, and
discussed in <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at
528 n.7, 152 A.3d 915. Dr. Kinsey thus
endorsed a retrospective prospective need
analysis, similar to what he had submitted
to Judge Troncone. Notably, however, Dr.
Kinsey had submitted a different approach
to Judge Wolfson in the South Brunswick
case after the Appellate Division decision
had issued, but before it was modified by
the Supreme Court. That approach was
similar to what Dr. Angelides advocated in
the Mercer trial.

<P20>On the other hand, Dr. Angelides rejected
reliance on past COAH practice given
the new and unique circumstances presented
by Gap Present Need. He calculated
the number of LMI households formed
during the gap and still in existence at the
end of the gap period and then reduced
that number by removing categories of
households in response to comments in the
Supreme Court's decision. Oddly enough,
although Dr. Angelides had criticized the
methodology developed by Dr. Kinsey and
submitted to Judge Wolfson in the South
Brunswick case, he adopted a similar approach
following the Supreme Court's decision.
Unsurprisingly, the calculations of
Gap Present Need advocated by the two
<Page 573>
experts were wildly divergent, with Dr.
Kinsey endorsing a much higher number
than that advocated by Dr. Angelides. In
that sense, their positions relative to each
other mirrored the conclusions they had
advanced in the Prospective Need phase of
the trial.

<P20>Mr. Bernard once again endorsed the
approach developed by Dr. Kinsey, with
several modifications, including the same
rejection
<SPage 182>
of a filtering adjustment that
he had recommended in Phase 1 of the
trial. Notably, after listening to the testimony
of Dr. Angelides, he went even further
and accepted a variation on one of the
adjustments advocated by Dr. Angelides.

<P20>Mr. Reading also changed his position
from the one he had advocated before
Judge Troncone, and then refined his recommendations
after listening to the testimony
presented during Phase 2 of the
trial. Although he largely supported the
method presented by Dr. Angelides, he
rejected or modified some of the adjustments
contained in that model. As noted
above, this lack of consensus reflected the
divergent results advocated by the parties
in the first phase of the trial, leading to
thirteen days of additional testimony between
May 15, 2017 and June 19, 2017.
Once again, the court appreciated the assistance
of Mr. Reading in reviewing the
two different proposed gap methodologies
from a neutral perspective.

<HN02>B. Gap Present Need Legal Standard

<P20>The <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU> decision explicitly
requires that gap period need be
included as part of the fair share affordable
housing methodology and places it
within the calculation of Present Need. 227
N.J. at 529-31, 152 A.3d 915. Although the
Supreme Court neither defined a specific
methodology to calculate gap period need,
nor expressed a preference for any of the
proposed approaches that had been submitted
to Judge Troncone, it did provide
additional guidance for the trial courts.
Firstly, the Supreme Court was unequivocal
in declaring that any fair share methodology
must include gap period need:

<B22>As to the fundamental disagreement&mdash;
whether the gap period must be addressed
&mdash;we waste no time in settling
that issue. There is no fair reading of
this Court's prior decisions that supports
disregarding the constitutional obligation
to address pent-up affordable
housing need for low- and moderate-income
households that formed during
the years in which COAH was unable to
promulgate valid Third Round rules.

<B22>[<EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 521, 152
A.3d 915.]

<P00>The Court reiterated in unmistakable
terms that there would be "no hiatus in
the constitutional obligation." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 522,
152 A.3d 915. It then directed that the
calculation of gap need be addressed
<SPage 183>
by
the trial courts as part of the judicial effort
to ensure compliance by New Jersey's municipalities
with their constitutional obligations:

<B22>We conclude, as did the Appellate Division
panel and the trial court, that the
need of presently existing low-and moderate-income
households formed during
the gap period must be captured and
included in setting affordable housing
obligations for towns that seek to be
protected from exclusionary zoning actions
under the process this Court has
set up while COAH is defunct....

<B22>[<EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 529, 152
A.3d 915 (internal citations omitted).]

<P20>Having identified the need, however, the
Court then had to determine how to incorporate
gap need into the fair share methodology.
In considering the options, the
Supreme Court agreed with the Appellate
Division that including gap need within
<Page 574>
Prospective Need was untenable. Indeed,
the Court observed that the very category
was "a more or less calcified term," having
been defined in the FHA and in COAH's
rules as purely forward looking. As a result,
the Court found that it would be
inappropriate to incorporate a retrospective
calculation&mdash;necessary for gap need&mdash;
into a category based on projections, concluding
that:

<B22>[b]y ... definition, [P]rospective [N]eed
is forward looking. It is predictive&mdash;a
projection of future need. The statutory
language was not designed to account
for past periods of time when performing
a calculation of anticipated housing
need for low- and moderate-income
households.

<B22>[<EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 526-27, 152
A.3d 915.]

<P20>Instead, following the suggestion of the
Appellate Division, the Supreme Court
concluded that of the available categories,
only Present Need had "the potential to
capture pent-up housing need that arose
during the sixteen-plus years of the gap
period and that continues to be an identifiable
category of housing need that experts
could flesh out." <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J.
at 526, 152 A.3d 915 (citing <EMU>Ocean County
Appeal</EMU>, 446 N.J. Super. at 294-95, 141 A.3d
359). In arriving at that conclusion, the
Court recognized that prior practice limited
the concept of Present Need to identifying
substandard and overcrowded existing
housing units at a single point in time&mdash;the
start of the next affordable housing cycle.
Nonetheless, the Court determined that
the category could be expanded to address
calculation of the need for affordable
<SPage 184>
housing of the LMI households that
formed between 1999 and 2015 and still
needed such housing at the end of that
period, which coincided with the beginning
of the Third Round fair share cycle. The
Supreme Court noted that because the
term Present Need was not defined in the
FHA, it was malleable and could be adapted
to address gap period need (hereinafter
referred to as "Gap Present Need").
<EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 529, 152 A.3d
915. While directing that Gap Present
Need be added to the fair share methodology
to determine municipal affordable
housing obligations, the Court explicitly
refused to endorse any of the analytical
approaches and characteristics of Gap
Present Need calculations presented to
Judge Troncone:

<B22>[T]his Court is not adopting any particular
party's expert's opinion on such characteristics,
which are a matter of dispute.
Rather, we find the phrase useful
only to describe the practice in which
the experts will have to engage to convince
the trial courts as to what characteristics
should be included when providing
a fair estimate of the need that arose
during the gap period and remains unmet
today.

<B22>[<EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 530 n.8,
152 A.3d 915.]

<P00>The Supreme Court did, however, provide
guidance to assist the trial courts in determining
this "fair estimate":

<B22>The trial courts must take care to ensure
that the present need is not calculated
in a way that includes persons who
are deceased, who are income-ineligible
or otherwise are no longer eligible for
affordable housing, or whose households
may be already captured through the
historic practice of surveying for deficient
housing units within the municipality.

<B22>[<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 531, 152 A.3d 915.]

<P20>The focus of Gap Present Need on the
unmet housing need of LMI households
formed between 1999 and 2015 might at
first blush appear to pose an easier task
for a trial court considering the matter in
2017-2018 than the calculation of Prospective
Need, which is based on projections
<Page 575>
and is inherently speculative in nature.
Somewhat unexpectedly, therefore, Gap
Present Need confronted the court with
complexities borne of the lack of existing
datasets to pinpoint the need, and with
conflicting methodologies advocated by the
experts that were even more divergent
than in the analysis of Prospective Need.
<SPage 185>

<P20>It quickly became apparent that even
though real data was available for the gap
period and projections could be avoided,
getting a handle on the number of LMI
households that formed in the gap period
and were still in need of affordable housing
in 2015 was extremely challenging. Moreover,
while placing gap need within the
broader category of Present Need, the calculation
of gap need was quite distinct
from traditional Present Need. As noted
above, whereas traditional Present Need
counts deficient housing units and is addressed
through the rehabilitation of those
units, Gap Present Need is measured in
LMI households and adds to a new construction
obligation.

<P20>While the Supreme Court chose Present
Need as the context for gap period need
because Present Need is not defined in the
FHA and therefore provided flexibility in
fashioning an appropriate methodology,
the absence of clear precedent or COAH
rules on the subject has made the task
more demanding. Although the Supreme
Court's admonition to the trial courts
when addressing Prospective Need to utilize
the most up-to-date and appropriate
data and to avoid policy-making better left
to the Legislative and Executive branches
continues to offer some guidance for determining
Gap Present Need, those guidelines
simply are more difficult to apply
when addressing a new category of need
based on unprecedented circumstances.
Yet, as the Supreme Court did not shy
away from requiring numerical obligations
to be calculated for Prospective Need despite
the acknowledged difficulty in making
multiple projections into the future,
<EMU>Mount Laurel II</EMU>, 92 N.J. at 257, 456 A.2d
390, so the complexities involved in determining
Gap Present Need did not deter
the Court from requiring the trial courts
to calculate numerical "fair estimates" of
that Need. <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at
528-521, 152 A.3d 915. So it is with more
than a little trepidation that the court approaches
the task at hand.

<HN02>C. Summary of Methodological Approaches

<P20>Lacking clearly applicable precedent
from COAH or prescription of a specific
methodology from the New Jersey appellate
<SPage 186>
courts, Drs. Angelides and Kinsey
enjoyed wider latitude in devising their
Gap Present Need methodology than they
did for determining Prospective Need.
Nonetheless, Dr. Angelides and Dr. Kinsey
both began their Gap Present Need calculations
by estimating LMI household
growth during the gap period, essentially
following their Prospective Need approaches.
Where the two experts diverged
was in how they estimated LMI Household
Growth, the very different adjustments
they applied to account for their interpretations
of the guidance provided in <EMU>Mount
Laurel V</EMU>, and the way in which they each
allocated and incorporated their Gap Present
Need obligations into the existing fair
share methodology.

<HN24>1. Dr. Angelides (for the municipalities)

<CN>a. Guiding Principles

<P20>Dr. Angelides interpreted <EMU>Mount Laurel
V</EMU> as requiring that he develop a novel
approach to calculate the newly defined
Gap Present Need that required consideration
of the current housing status of gap
period LMI households. Angelides Gap
Rpt. (April 12, 2017), Ex. P 86 at 9. According
<Page 576>
to Dr. Angelides, both the Appellate
Division's gap decision and <EMU>Mount
Laurel V</EMU> made clear that Gap Present
Need is not a "separate and discrete" component
of need that can be captured by a
retrospective Prospective Need methodology
under the FHA. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> (citing <EMU>Mount
Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 519-20, 152 A.3d
915). Dr. Angelides asserted that under
<EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, no prior fair share method
was adequate to capture need under the
unique circumstances of the gap period.
Dr. Angelides specifically rejected the use
of the Second Round Prior-Cycle Prospective
Need recalculation of First Round obligations
because he concluded that it
failed to consider current housing circumstances.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU> In that process COAH had
recalculated First Round Prospective
Need obligations on a retrospective basis
to correct for over-projections before unmet
First Round need was incorporated
into Second Round obligations. <EMU>See</EMU> 26
N.J.R. 2302 (June 6, 1994) (comment 6)
(codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93-2.8
<SPage 187>
app. A). As
a result, COAH dampened down Prior Cycle
Prospective Need by 48 percent to
provide a mid-period (1990) correction.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>Dr. Angelides claimed that, unlike in
<EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU> where the Supreme
Court had directed the trial courts to follow
Prior Round COAH practices, the Supreme
Court in <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU> offered
trial judges "considerable flexibility" to
utilize new methods when crafting Gap
Present Need methodologies. Angelides
Gap Rpt. (April 12, 2017), Ex. P 86 at 11.
Dr. Angelides outlined four "common and
central principles" he derived from <EMU>Mount
Laurel V</EMU>: (1) "Gap Present Need households
must have been added during the
gap period," (2) "Gap Present Need households
must currently be LMI and otherwise
eligible for affordable housing" (excludes
gap period LMI households still
living in the state with significant assets),
(3) "Gap Present Need households must
not be represented within the traditional
quantification of Present Need" (excludes
gap period LMI households living in overcrowded
or deficient housing), and (4)
"Gap Present Need households must currently
have an identifiable need for affordable
housing" (excludes gap period LMI
households that live in affordable housing).
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 6-8.

<CN>b. Methodological Approach

<P20>Dr. Angelides utilized what he termed a
"single snapshot" approach, making his
calculations of LMI household growth and
associated reductions at a single point in
time, that being the end of the gap period
in 2015. He consciously sought to mimic
the aspect of traditional Present Need that
estimates existing deficient units as a
"snapshot" of current need within a municipality,
even utilizing that term&mdash;which
had been employed by the Supreme Court
to describe traditional Present Need&mdash;in
his gap analysis. <EMU>See Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227
N.J. at 527, 152 A.3d 915. Since both he
and Dr. Kinsey accepted the same updated
estimates of total households for 1999 and
2015 from datasets published by the United
States Census Bureau, concluding that
total households in New Jersey increased
by 187,390 households during the gap
<SPage 188>
period, the multi-step total household
growth calculations of the Prospective
Need phase were not necessary for either
expert. Reading Final Gap Rpt. (June 12,
2017), Ex. SM 11 at 4.

<P20>Dr. Angelides started his "single snapshot"
approach by taking the increase in
total households over the gap period and
applying ratios that he calculated to show
the percentage of that total that qualified
as LMI in 2015. This method contrasted
with the methodology employed by Dr.
Kinsey, which estimated the number of
LMI households in 1999 and 2015, and
then calculated the difference between the
<Page 577>
two. Dr. Angelides utilized true median
incomes in his analysis, as he had done in
his Prospective Need methodology. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
That process yielded a growth in LMI
households in the gap period of 73,213
LMI households, which is 39.07 percent of
the total household growth during the period.
He then adjusted his total LMI
household number by removing those gap
period LMI households that were living in
affordable housing, possessed significant
assets, or that overlapped with units captured
as part of traditional Present Need
as of 2015. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 11-12. Dr. Angelides
allocated this regional-level Gap Present
Need to municipalities utilizing the same
four allocation factors from his Prospective
Need approach. Angelides Gap Rpt. (April
12, 2017), Ex. P 86 at 43. He then added
his Gap Present Need for each municipality
to his previously calculated municipal
Prospective Need before applying the 20
percent caps on new construction obligations.

<HN24>2. Dr. Kinsey (for FSHC)

<CN>a. Guiding Principles

<P20>Dr. Kinsey's approach was based on
his position that the Supreme Court in
<EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU> did not intend Gap
Present Need to be constrained by the
single snapshot structure of traditional
Present Need, but only included gap period
obligations within Present Need to
accommodate the framework for fair
share obligations established in the FHA.
<Page 578>
Dr. Kinsey maintained that <EMU>Mount Laurel
V</EMU> did not modify <EMU>Mount Laurel IV's</EMU> direction
that "First and Second Round
methodologies be employed, without policy
modifications" in determining Gap
Present Need. Kinsey Gap Rpt. (April 12,
2017), Ex. DF 85 at 8-9. Dr. Kinsey's
approach to calculating Gap Present
Need thus generally tracked his Prospective
Need methodology, which he justified
by citing COAH's use of that approach
when the agency performed its Second
Round Prior-Cycle Prospective Need calculations
to correct for over-projections
in the First Round. Dr. Kinsey modified
COAH's Prior-Cycle Prospective Need
calculations, however, to take advantage
of additional datasets covering the entire
gap period that
<SPage 190>
were unavailable to
COAH in 1994. Dr. Kinsey described his
approach as employing "Prior Round
methodology's techniques, but on a retrospective
basis," in which he utilized "detailed
data on what actually occurred
during 1999-2015," rather than relying on
projections. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 10, 13.

<P20>Although Dr. Kinsey noted that there
was insufficient data available to reliably
estimate the total number of LMI households
that came into existence, or formed,
during the gap period due to what he
termed "the unquantifiable churning" in
which LMI households formed, unformed,
moved, died, left or returned to New Jersey
between 1999 and 2015, <EMU>id.</EMU> at 15, he
opined that using a retrospective Prospective
Need analysis was the best method to
identify Gap Present Need. He also asserted
that it was "an appropriately conservative
approach completely consistent with
the approach COAH took in its Second
Round methodology," both when COAH
included one "gap" year in its calculation
of Second Round Prospective Need and
when it recalculated First Round obligations.
Dr. Kinsey also presented data
showing that rents and residential real
estate prices rose faster than incomes during
the gap period, resulting in a net decrease
in available affordable housing during
those years. In addition, he also cited
data that showed that many LMI households
were paying over thirty percent of
their incomes for housing, rendering them
"cost-burdened." While he acknowledged
that neither COAH nor the courts had
ever included a calculation of cost-burdened
LMI households in fair share methodologies,
he asserted that testimony on
this subject was necessary to provide an
important "context" for the court's consideration
of Gap Present Need.

<CN>b. Methodological Approach

<P20>For his Gap Present Need calculations,
Dr. Kinsey reprised his multi-step Prospective
Need methodology, beginning
with the same incremental "two snapshots"
approach he had used to calculate LMI
household growth previously. Reading Final
Gap Rpt. (June 12, 2017), Ex. SM 11 at
6. Dr. Kinsey estimated the growth of
LMI households during the gap period by
calculating the
<SPage 191>
number of LMI households
at the beginning and end of the gap
period using the same HUD/COAH-derived
income grids he had employed in
Phase 1 of the trial. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 7. Continuing
his Prospective Need approach, Dr. Kinsey
pooled and reallocated gap period LMI
household growth for working age households
to regions that experienced recent
job growth. Kinsey Gap Rpt. (April 12,
2017), Ex. DF 85 at 75. Dr. Kinsey then
allocated his regional LMI household
growth to the municipalities, exempting
urban aid municipalities, so that he could
then apply secondary source adjustments
for demolitions, conversions and filtering
that occurred during the gap period. Reading
Final Gap Rpt. (June 12, 2017), Ex. SM
11 at 5-7, 11. Dr. Kinsey then added these
municipal Gap Present Need obligations to
<Page 579>
his previously calculated municipal Unmet
Prior Round Obligations, Present Need,
and Prospective Need. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> However, Dr.
Kinsey advocated applying twenty percent
caps to Prospective Need and Gap Present
Need estimates separately before adding
those numbers together with the other
categories of Third Round obligations.

<HN24>3. Mr. Bernard (for NJSBA)

<P20>Mr. Bernard generally supported Dr.
Kinsey's Gap Present Need approach, with
some modifications, and was very critical
of the methodology advocated by Dr. Angelides.
Mr. Bernard agreed with Dr. Kinsey
that a "two snapshot" approach was
appropriate because it considered housing
activity over the entire gap period. Like
Dr. Kinsey, Mr. Bernard advocated following
COAH's Second Round Prior-Cycle
Prospective Need approach for calculating
Gap Present Need. Bernard Gap Rpt.
(April 12, 2017), Ex. DB 46 at 2. However,
unlike Dr. Kinsey, Mr. Bernard would
have applied secondary source adjustments
for only conversions and demolitions,
having deemed the use of filtering to
have been overturned by the Appellate
Division and not being convinced that any
filtering methodology proposed in this case
satisfied the Appellate Division's concerns.
Bernard Gap Response Rpt. (April 24,
2017), Ex. DB 47 at 1. Mr. Bernard also
suggested modifications to Dr. Kinsey's
calculation of conversions and treatment of
<Page 580>
the Highlands area of New Jersey. He
strongly criticized Dr. Angelides' rejection
<SPage 193>
of the HUD/COAH-derived grids to establish
LMI incomes, pointing out that this
approach greatly reduced the Gap Present
Need estimates. Mr. Bernard likewise rejected
the adjustments made by Dr. Angelides
to reduce the overall gap need,
Bernard Gap Rpt. (April 12, 2017), Ex. DB
46 at 7, although he eventually did accept
making some modified adjustment to Dr.
Angelides' calculation for the overlap with
traditional Present Need.

<P20>While Mr. Bernard initially rejected the
adjustment advocated by Dr. Angelides to
prevent the overlap identified by the Supreme
Court with traditional Present
Need, <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 529-30,
152 A.3d 915, he later conceded in testimony
that a Present Need overlap adjustment
could have merit. He qualified his
endorsement of this reduction, however,
noting that it should not include Present
Need in urban aid municipalities because
they do not receive new construction obligations
under the fair share methodology.
Mr. Bernard also agreed with Dr. Kinsey
in rejecting the reduction taken by Dr.
Angelides for LMI households living in
affordable housing because it was impossible
to ascertain which of those households
were formed during the gap period, such
an adjustment could lead to double-counting
when municipalities take bonus credits
for the construction of affordable units in
the gap period during the compliance process,
and because of the marked increase
in cost-burdened LMI households during
the gap period. Bernard Gap Rpt. (April
12, 2017), Ex. DB 46 at 13, 18.

<HN24>4. Special Master Reading

<P20>Special Master Reading generally
agreed with the Gap Present Need approach
proposed by Dr. Angelides, rejecting
Dr. Kinsey's Prospective Need methodology
that he had favored in the Ocean
County proceedings because it appeared
less responsive to the concerns articulated
by the Supreme Court in <EMU>Mount Laurel V.</EMU>
Mr. Reading testified that although Dr.
Kinsey's use of an incremental Prospective
Need methodology was not unreasonable,
Dr. Angelides' approach directly addressed
the new and unique circumstances of Gap
Present Need. In particular, Mr. Reading
<SPage 194>
agreed with Dr. Angelides that his single
snapshot approach to calculating gap
period LMI household growth was more
consistent with the point-in-time analysis
of traditional Present Need, and more appropriately
responded to the Supreme
Court's <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU> decision.

<P20>Mr. Reading recommended Dr. Angelides'
Gap Present Need methodology, but
with modified adjustments. Mr. Reading
concluded that the significant asset test
should not be used to adjust Gap Present
Need for the same reasons he rejected the
test in Phase 1 of the trial. While he
viewed the test as reasonable, he deemed
it to reflect a policy determination that
should only be endorsed as part of a comprehensive
re-evaluation of the fair share
methodology by an administrative agency
that would examine many considerations
and not just this one policy change in
isolation. In addition, Mr. Reading recommended
that LMI households living in
deed-restricted affordable housing should
not be excluded from Gap Present Need
because municipalities may already have
either been given bonus credits for those
units, or may be applying for credits for
those units during the ongoing Third
Round compliance process. The adjustment
made by Dr. Angelides in removing
such households could thus lead to a double
reduction in the obligation in many
towns, improperly diluting their fair share
obligations. Indeed, the court confirms
<Page 581>
that several Mercer County municipalities
that have settled with FSHC have sought
bonus credits for affordable housing units
constructed from 1999 through the first
half of 2015 as part of the compliance
process. Mr. Reading, however, accepted
the adjustment to remove gap period LMI
households living in affordable housing
units that were not deed restricted since
such an adjustment would not lead to double
counting in the compliance process. He
also concluded that while overlap with traditional
Present Need should be excluded
from Gap Present Need, the adjustment
should be modified not to exclude households
living in QUAMs because those urban
municipalities do not have a new construction
need, essentially agreeing with
the testimony of Mr. Bernard in
<SPage 195>
this
regard. Reading Final Gap Rpt. (June 12,
2017), Ex. SM 11 at 22.

<HN02>D. Gap Present Need Methodology

<P20>Drs. Angelides and Kinsey began their
approaches by estimating LMI household
growth during the gap period, and then
applying adjustments to account for the
guidance provided by <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>. In
fashioning an appropriate Gap Present
Need methodology, the court will determine
the appropriate approach to
<SPage 196>
calculate LMI household growth, and
then evaluate the proposed adjustments.
<Page 582>

<HN20>1. Gap Period LMI Household Growth

<P20>In determining an estimate of the
number of LMI households that formed
during the gap period, all of the experts
agreed that no existing dataset provided a
direct answer. In fact, Mr. Reading testified
that available datasets were much better
at tracking housing units than LMI
household formation. So the effort to identify
LMI households that formed during
the gap period proved to be somewhat
elusive. As in other parts of the fair share
methodology, the court had to select from
imperfect approaches, both of which contained
troubling elements the court was
unable to endorse. So once again the court
struggled to fashion an acceptable alternative
that would result in a fair and reasonable
estimate of Gap Present Need without
accepting any one complete methodology
proposed by the experts. And once again
the court hopes to avoid unforeseen negative
consequences that might flow from
combining the most convincing aspects of
each model.

<P20>Both experts started their analyses by
determining the total number of households
in New Jersey in 1999 and 2015 and
determining the increase in households
over the sixteen-year period of the gap.
Unlike the Prospective Need period that
required the use of projections, estimates
of total households at the beginning and
end of the gap period became available
from the United States Census Bureau
and were accepted by both experts, eliminating
the need for the elaborate calculations
utilized in the Prospective Need
methodology:

</T>
<SPage 197>

<B22>[Reading Final Gap Rpt. (June 12,
2017), Ex. SM 11 at 4.]

<P00>From this point on, however, their methodologies
diverged significantly.

<P20>As noted above, Dr. Angelides determined
his estimate of the number of LMI
households for 2015 only, calling it a "single
snapshot" approach, which he deemed
appropriate since the Supreme Court combined
gap need with traditional Present
Need, also calculated at a single point in
time. Notably, all of his calculations used
true median incomes and not the HUD/COAH-derived
income grids endorsed by
the court in Phase 1 of the trial. Dr. Angelides
calculated 2015 LMI household ratios
and applied them to total household
growth during the gap period. He derived
his 2015 LMI Household Ratios, by household
size and region, utilizing LMI income
thresholds set at eighty percent of observed
median incomes in the 2015 ACS
One-Year PUMS. Dr. Angelides then multiplied
the 2015 LMI Household Ratios by
the gap period Total Household Growth
for each of the forty-two region and household
size combinations. Dr. Angelides asserted
that this "single snapshot" approach
identified those households formed in the
gap period that currently qualify as LMI,
which he then aggregated by region. Angelides
Gap Rpt. (April 12, 2017), Ex. P 86
at 20-26. He referred to his estimate of the
LMI households that formed during the
gap as making up a "pot," from which he
made deductions for various adjustments
he deemed required by <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>.
He also made certain assumptions about
each level or "strata" of LMI households
derived from true median incomes (<EMU>i.e.</EMU>,
<Page 583>
moderate, low, and very low income levels),
which assumed that each household in
the strata could afford housing affordable
to households earning the top incomes in
the category.

<P20>Dr. Kinsey utilized what he called a "two
snapshot" approach, whereby he determined
the percentages of LMI households
in 1999 and 2015 for each of 168 "cells"
representing the various county and age
cohort groupings that he had also analyzed
in his Prospective Need methodology. The
incomes he used in his model were derived
from COAH's income grid from 2000 and
the grid he
<SPage 198>
calculated for 2015 using
HUD data because COAH had not updated
the grid itself. Using those incomes for
moderate, low and very low income households,
he determined the share of total
households that were LMI for every age
group by county for each of the end points
of the gap period. He then applied those
LMI household ratios in each of the cells
to total households in every cell to produce
the number of LMI households at the beginning
and end of the gap period. Dr.
Kinsey then subtracted the number of
LMI households in 1999 from the number
in 2015, concluding that 93,398 LMI households
were added during the gap period.
Kinsey Gap Rpt. (April 12, 2017), Ex. DF
85 at 28-34. Note that Dr. Kinsey later
updated this number and used 93,451 as
the number of LMI households formed
during the gap period. While his calculations
yielded a statewide average of 41.16
percent of New Jersey's households that
were qualified as LMI in 1999, using census
data, and 41.66 percent of the State's
households that were qualified as LMI in
2015, using ACS/PUMS data, the incremental
growth of LMI households during
the period was 49.87 percent. Reading Final
Gap Rpt. (June 12, 2017), Ex. SM 11 at
5.

<P20>Dr. Kinsey asserted&mdash;in response to
characteristics that the Supreme Court
had identified as needing to be excluded
from Gap Present Need (<EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>,
227 N.J. at 529-30, 152 A.3d 915)&mdash;that the
increase in households he calculated reflected
the number of LMI households that
came into existence during the gap period
and were still in existence at the end of the
period. He claimed that his model excluded
those who had died and those who were
income-ineligible. Finally, Dr. Kinsey asserted
that the number of LMI households
captured within traditional Present Need
in 2015 should not be subtracted from Gap
Present Need despite the Supreme Court's
explicit direction to exclude such households
to avoid double-counting because
COAH had not deducted Present Need in
its Prior Cycle Prospective Need calculation,
which Dr. Kinsey maintained was the
only proper way to determine Gap Present
Need. <EMU>See Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at
529-30, 152 A.3d 915.
<SPage 199>

<P20>Notably, Dr. Kinsey utilized different
datasets to calculate his LMI household
ratios in 1999 and in 2015, albeit out of
necessity. Reading Final Gap Rpt. (June
12, 2017), Ex. SM 11 at 4-5. Because detailed
PUMS income data was not yet
available in 1999, Dr. Kinsey relied on 2000
Census data, which he sorted using the
2000 COAH income grid. Kinsey Gap Rpt.
(April 12, 2017), Ex. DF 85 at 31. Dr.
Kinsey used 2000 Census income data because
it reflected 1999 incomes, and the
2000 COAH grid because it was based, in
part, on household income data derived
from the fourth quarter of 1999. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> For
2015, Dr. Kinsey used 2015 ACS PUMS
income data. Since a COAH grid was not
available for 2015, Dr. Kinsey sorted
PUMS income data using a 2015 income
grid he devised utilizing HUD 2015 county
income limits, as he had done in his Prospective
Need analysis. He then applied
secondary source adjustments to his estimate
<Page 584>
of LMI households formed during
the gap period.

<P20>As in the Prospective Need phase, the
approaches of the experts yielded significantly
divergent results. The difference in
their gap period LMI household growth
estimates is set forth in the following
chart:

<P00>For the reasons discussed below, the court
prefers Dr. Kinsey's approach using the
HUD/COAH-derived income grids to determine
the number of LMI households in
2015, but will modify his methodology to
address concerns raised by Mr. Reading
about some of the results produced by Dr.
Kinsey's model.

<P20>As noted above, Mr. Reading favored
Dr. Angelides' approach because he felt it
better responded to the unique circumstances
<SPage 200>
presented
by the gap period and
comments made by the Supreme Court in
<EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 529-30, 152
A.3d 915. For the estimation of LMI
household growth, he once again preferred
Dr. Angelides' use of "true" mathematical
medians over the COAH income grids, and
recommended this approach to the court.
However, the court will require the use of
income grids in the estimation of gap period
LMI household growth as advocated by
Dr. Kinsey and Mr. Bernard, for the same
reasons expressed above in the discussion
of Prospective Need. COAH never wavered
in its use of the HUD-based grids,
and changing that policy for the gap period
would lead to a mismatch between LMI
households that make up Gap Present
Need and LMI households that can qualify
to live in the new deed-restricted units
ultimately made available to address this
need.

<P20>In addition, although Dr. Angelides
characterized his methodology as a "single
snapshot" in time in an apparent effort to
make it fit better with traditional Present
Need, he started his approach to LMI
household growth by calculating the net-change
in total households during the gap
period. Consequently, using the term "single
snapshot" to describe his methodology
is somewhat of a misnomer. Moreover, the
Supreme Court simply did not require that
Gap Present Need mimic traditional Present
Need in this or any other way. In fact,
the Court specifically noted that the concept
of Present Need "does not have to be
limited to a survey approach to housing
units" that were substandard and would be
addressed through rehabilitation, but could
and should be expanded to include an analytical
component that identifies a number
of LMI households whose need for affordable
housing will be addressed by imposing
new construction obligations upon municipalities.
<EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 529,
152 A.3d 915.

<P20>Dr. Kinsey, on the other hand, stubbornly
insisted that reading <EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU>
and <EMU>V</EMU> together required the court to follow
COAH's Prior Cycle Prospective Need approach,
even though the Supreme Court
<Page 585>
had only acknowledged that approach "as
a matter of historical record," and had
specifically refused to endorse it or
<SPage 201>
any
of the other models presented to Judge
Troncone because they had not been tested
by cross-examination. <EMU>See Mount Laurel
V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 528 n. 7, 529, 152 A.3d
915. While the court favors Dr. Kinsey's
methodology because it uses the income
grids long endorsed by COAH, the court
cannot accept his inexplicably inflated Gap
LMI Household Growth Rate of almost
fifty percent because of its significant deviation
from COAH's rule of thumb. As the
court noted earlier in its discussion of
Phase 1 of the trial, COAH projected constant
LMI Household Ratios throughout
the Prospective Need period because it
was impossible to reliably calculate those
ratios ten years into the future due to the
"many imponderables" recognized by
COAH consultant Dr. Robert Burchell.
Here, however, looking into the past, the
court expected data to be available from
which LMI Household Ratios could be reliably
estimated for both 1999 and 2015.
Unfortunately, in practice this was not the
case because the data used by Dr. Kinsey
at the beginning and end of the gap period
was apparently not compatible and skewed
the results for 2015.

<P20>As repeated throughout this decision,
COAH has consistently observed that LMI
Household Growth Rates "almost by definition"
hover around forty percent. <EMU>See,
e.g.</EMU>, 46 N.J.R. 953 (June 3, 2014). COAH
utilized this rule of thumb because it established
a range of reasonable values
around the mathematical median. Special
Master Reading thus became very troubled
by Dr. Kinsey's model that found over
93,000 gap period households in need of
affordable housing in 2015 because that
calculation reflected a growth rate of 49.87
percent during the sixteen-year period.
Mr. Reading characterized this result as
unreasonably high, attributing its significant
variation from COAH's rule of thumb
to the inappropriate mixing of data sources
used by Dr. Kinsey in 1999 and 2015.
Indeed, Dr. Angelides demonstrated that
Dr. Kinsey's approach produced volatile
gap period LMI household growth rates
between regions from a low of five percent
in Region 1, to a high of 85.1 percent for
Region 6. Angelides Gap Rpt. (April 12,
2017), Ex. P 115 at 32. Even more concerning
were the variations in Dr. Kinsey's
countywide results, which were not discussed
in
<SPage 202>
the testimony, but were admitted
into evidence on CD-ROM. Kinsey

<P20>Such wildly varying LMI Household
Growth Rates leave many counties far
<Page 586>
from COAH's "about 40 percent" guidance
and are indicative of a flawed approach.

<P20>Although Mr. Reading endorsed Dr. Angelides'
approach to gap period LMI
household growth calculations, he also
gave serious consideration to Dr. Kinsey's
model as an alternative method. Mr. Reading
concluded that modifying Dr. Kinsey's
methodological steps to apply his 2015
LMI Household Ratios, which averaged
41.66 percent statewide, to the growth in
total households during the gap period
would be both "reasonable and acceptable."
Reading Final Gap Rpt. (June 12,
2017), Ex. SM 11 at 18. Mr. Reading testified
that such modification would both negate
any skewing from data mixing and
would produce LMI Household Growth
Rates closer to the COAH benchmark of
"about 40 percent." Moreover, using constant
LMI ratios for Gap Present Need
would mirror the court's handling of Dr.
Kinsey's LMI growth ratios in the Prospective
Need phase of the trial. While
calculating Gap Present Need enabled the
experts to use actual data, the "imponderables"
created by the "churning" of LMI
households in the gap period and the absence
of datasets to reliably measure such
LMI household formation created circumstances
eerily similar to what confronted
the court when facing the projections necessary
to determine Prospective Need. Mr.
Reading summarized the numerical recommendations
of the experts and added his
modification of
<SPage 203>
Dr. Kinsey's analysis in
the following chart, which reflects changes
in the numbers originally used by both

</T>
<B22>[Reading Final Gap Rpt. (June 12, 2017),
Ex. SM 11 at 5.]

<P20>Since Dr. Kinsey's method produced
LMI Household Growth Rates so wildly
variable as to not only contradict COAH's
basic understanding of the operation of
LMI Household Ratios, but to test the
bounds of reasonableness, the court endorses
Mr. Reading's modification of Dr.
Kinsey's approach. Notably, Dr. Kinsey
was never able to explain why his results
were reliable despite their significant deviation
from COAH's established rule of
thumb. He simply testified that his estimates
of Gap Present Need were the product
of the calculations he performed trying
to mimic COAH's Prior Cycle Prospective
Need approach and should be accepted by
the court on that basis.

<P20>Moreover, Dr. Kinsey never convinced
the court that blindly following the Prior
Cycle methodology made sense when calculating
LMI households formed during
the gap period who were still in need of
affordable housing in 2015. In recalculating
First Round obligations based on over-projections,
COAH appeared to be replicating
the same process it had performed
<Page 587>
in arriving at the faulty projections, but
using more recent data. <EMU>See</EMU> 26 N.J.R. 2348
(June 6, 1994). That makes sense when
undoing a past calculation. Notably, however,
although Dr. Kinsey aimed to follow
COAH's Prior Cycle approach, it was not
clear to the court from the rulemaking
record exactly how COAH determined to
reduce the
<SPage 204>
First Round obligations by a
flat forty-eight percent. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> Nor was Dr.
Kinsey able to convince the court that he
knew exactly what COAH did because the
technical appendix did not contain any actual
calculations. <EMU>See</EMU> 26 N.J.R. 2348 (June
6, 1994). So the court was not convinced
that Dr. Kinsey's calculations really were
consistent with COAH's Prior Cycle approach.
For Gap Present Need, however,
the court is not correcting a prior faulty
calculation of Prospective Need, but is
looking back to estimate the number of
LMI households created over a sixteen-year
period that still need affordable housing
today. That exercise strikes the court
as related to, but distinctly different from
what COAH was doing to dampen down
unduly inflated obligations calculated using
a Prospective Need formula in the First
Round. While aspects of Prospective Need
analysis such as use of the COAH grids
seem appropriate in determining Gap
Present Need, replicating the entire process
was not a perfect fit in this context.

<P20>While the court accepts Dr. Kinsey's
assertion that consistent data sources were
not available for both 1999 and 2015, this
fact does not alter the likelihood that their
use skewed his results, causing his wildly
variable gap period LMI household ratios
and resulting in an increment in the gap
period that far exceeded COAH's rule of
thumb. Consequently, the court endorses
Special Master Reading's analysis that Dr.
Kinsey's unacceptable results were likely
caused by inappropriate data mixing, and
adopts Mr. Reading's modification of the
Kinsey approach, which applies Dr. Kinsey's
2015 LMI Household Ratios to gap
period total household growth:

<C5><EMU>Gap Period LMI Household Growth</EMU>
<T>
                  Total HH Growth     LMI HH Growth

  Region Four      40,625                17,324

  New Jersey      187,390                77,677
</T>
<SPage 205>

<P00>Mr. Reading's modification actually produces
a statewide average LMI Household
Growth Rate of 41.45 percent, which is
slightly lower than the 41.66 percent average
of the applied 2015 LMI Household
Ratios, due to household growth distributions.

<P20>Although the court recognizes that LMI
Household Growth Rates can fluctuate
around forty percent, and are not completely
static, the court viewed its choice
here as being between applying Dr. Kinsey's
2015 ratios to total household growth,
which produces a statewide average LMI
Household Growth Rate of 41.45 percent,
or using his incremental approach that
yielded an average growth rate of 49.87
percent. Faced with these alternatives, the
court deemed it better, and ultimately
more reasonable, to apply the 2015 LMI
Household Ratios to diminish the wildly
divergent county and individual "cell" ratios
calculated by Dr. Kinsey.
<Page 588>

<P20>Having decided to incorporate this modification
of Dr. Kinsey's approach into the
fair share methodology, the court now considers
the very different adjustments proposed
by Dr. Angelides and Dr. Kinsey in
their calculations of the gap period affordable
housing need that remained unmet in
2015. Since the methodological steps of the
experts do not match, the court will consider
each expert's adjustments separately.

<HN20>2. Dr. Kinsey's Adjustments

<P20>Dr. Kinsey adjusted Gap Present Need
by adapting his entire Prospective Need
methodology to the gap period. As noted
above, Dr. Kinsey's approach is largely
based on his understanding of COAH's
1994 Prior-Cycle Prospective Need recalculation,
using the "most up-to-date available
data that reflected actual, observed
growth during the gap period." Kinsey
Gap Rpt. (April 12, 2017), Ex. DF 85 at 10.

<CN>a. Reallocation of Working Age
Household Growth

<P20>In keeping with his Prospective
Need methodology, the first adjustment to
gap period LMI household growth that Dr.
Kinsey proposed was to pool and reallocate
portions of that growth occurring in households
below age sixty-five to regions
<SPage 206>
based on historic job growth. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 33.
This reallocation of working age household
growth was included by COAH as part of
the Second Round Prospective Need calculations:

<B22>... the growth of households below age
65 is put into a statewide pool and allocated
to regions of the state according to
the proportional share of nonresidential
ratable growth.... Thus, growth in the
working-age component of low- and
moderate-income households was assigned
to regions where jobs previously
grew. On the other hand, growth in the
elderly and presumably non-working
population was retained in the original
region where this growth took place.

<B22>[26 N.J.R. 2347 (June 6, 1994).]

<P00>However, this pooling and reallocation step
was not applied in the calculation of Prospective
Need in this trial because neither
Dr. Kinsey nor Dr. Angelides attributed
any of the LMI household growth during
the Prospective Need period to households
headed by persons younger than sixty-five
years of age, reflecting the demographic
characteristics of the Baby Boomer generation.
<EMU>See</EMU> Reading Rpt. (August 31, 2016),
Ex. SM 4 at 50. Moreover, there is no
indication in the rulemaking record whether
COAH included a reallocation of need in
its Prior Cycle Prospective Need calculation.
<EMU>See</EMU> 26 N.J.R. 2348 (June 6, 1994).

<P20>Mr. Bernard agreed with Dr. Kinsey's
inclusion of this step to determine Gap
Present Need as it would counter the displacement
of LMI households from areas
of job growth that occurred during the gap
period. Mr. Reading questioned including
this inter-regional reallocation step, however,
because its purpose in Prior Rounds
was to predict areas of future housing
need based on previous employment
growth and not on the housing need of
LMI households that already exist. Reading
Final Gap Rpt. (June 12, 2017), Ex. SM
11 at 5-6. Mr. Bernard countered that
although the LMI households already existed,
the affordable housing units to accommodate
them had not yet been built,
and thus could still be relocated as part of
this step.

<P20>For Gap Present Need, Dr. Kinsey advocated
reallocating a significant portion
(39.5 percent) of LMI household growth
out of Region 4:

<C5><EMU>Kinsey Reallocation of Gap Period LMI
Household Growth</EMU>

</T>
<B22>[Reading Final Gap Rpt. (June 12, 2017),
Ex. SM 11 at 6.]

<P00>While application of the reallocation method
would reduce Gap Present Need for
Region 4 and Mercer County, it would
shift a new construction obligation away
from where the gap period LMI households
are currently located. Offering an
opportunity for a Mercer County LMI
household to relocate to Bergen County,
which receives the largest portion of the
reallocation, is not something envisioned in
<EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU> and does not make sense
in terms of the Supreme Court's purpose
of providing affordable housing for presently
existing LMI households formed during
the gap period. This court has been
focused on determining the current need
of gap period LMI households in Mercer
County and establishing municipal obligations
to meet that need. Incorporating
this step into a calculation of Gap Present
Need is an example of how blindly following
the Prospective Need methodology is
not a good fit to satisfy the task assigned
to the court. Consequently, the court rejects
Dr. Kinsey's proposed reallocation of
LMI household growth between regions,
which would shift a significant percent of
need away from where LMI gap households
are living today.
<SPage 208>

<CN>b. Gap Period Secondary
Source Adjustments

<P20>After reallocating gap period LMI
household growth between regions, Dr.
Kinsey's next adjustment was for municipal
secondary sources. Dr. Kinsey's approach
was a further adaptation of his fair
share Prospective Need methodology, including
allocating regional Gap Present
Need to the municipalities in each region,
then calculating and applying municipal
secondary source adjustments, but retrospectively
for the gap period. Reading Final
Gap Rpt. (June 12, 2017), Ex. SM 11 at
19. As in his Prospective Need methodology,
Dr. Kinsey adjusted municipal Gap
Present Need to reflect estimated changes
in the housing stock attributable to demolitions,
conversions and filtering. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> Dr.
Kinsey's gap period secondary source adjustments
increased statewide Gap Present
Need significantly:

</T>
<B22>[Reading Final Gap Report (June 12,
2017), SM 11 at 8.]

<P20>Special Master Reading recommended
rejecting Dr. Kinsey's Gap Present Need
secondary source adjustments, concluding
that because such adjustments were conceived
as predictive calculations, they
should apply only as part of a future Prospective
Need methodology. As observed
by Dr. Kinsey, however, COAH included
secondary source adjustments in its calculation
of Prior Cycle Prospective Need,
which was a retrospective calculation. 26
N.J.R. 2348 (June 6, 1994). As the court
noted above, however, in the Second
Round COAH was retrofitting its Prospective
Need calculations from the First
Round in order to reduce the obligations it
<SPage 209>
had previously over-projected, and may
have included secondary source adjustments
because they had been incorporated
into the formula applied in the First
Round to establish the obligations COAH
was then revising. Mr. Reading expressed
additional concern that Dr. Kinsey's proposed
adjustments had the potential to
double count demolitions and conversions,
which had already occurred and may have
been included to some extent in calculating
traditional Present Need. Although Mr.
Bernard generally agreed with Dr. Kinsey's
use of demolitions and conversions to
expand Gap Present Need, he joined Mr.
Reading in expressing discomfort with the
inclusion of filtering in the calculation of
that need for the same reasons they both
rejected filtering previously in the calculation
of Prospective Need. Mr. Bernard also
took exception to how Dr. Kinsey calculated
conversions and handled the Highlands
area of the State.

<P20>The court is wary about adjusting Gap
Present Need to add secondary sources.
The Supreme Court in <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>
focused on LMI households created during
the gap. When estimating households that
have already formed, making adjustments
for changes in housing units such as those
caused by demolitions and conversions that
have already occurred seems incompatible
with the task at hand. That Dr. Kinsey's
Gap Present Need soared far above the
number of gap period LMI households he
identified as having been formed during
the gap period underscored yet again how
a full Prospective Need approach is incompatible
with the thrust of the Supreme
Court's gap period analysis.

<P20>Indeed, Dr. Kinsey's use of secondary
sources focuses on housing units and not
households, fundamentally remaining at
odds with this court's conception of the
components necessary to calculate Gap
Present Need. Firstly, adding significantly
to the gap need due to filtering is as ill-advised
in this context due to the unproven
complexities of the model designed by Dr.
Kinsey as it was when the court considered
a similar adjustment for Prospective
Need. Notably, Mr. Bernard recommended
rejecting this adjustment in both Phases 1
and 2 of the trial, a recommendation
<Page 591>
<SPage 210>
concurred in by Mr. Reading. The court
agrees that there is no place in a "fair
estimate" of Gap Present Need for an
adjustment based on filtering. The proposed
method is simply too unreliable to
be incorporated into a calculation of Gap
Present Need.

<P20>While excluding demolitions and conversions
is not as clear cut, they do not have a
viable place in a retrospective analysis
based on the need of gap period LMI
households for affordable housing in 2015
when those changes in the housing market
have already occurred. This court is not
undoing a past over-projection calculated
with data shown in retrospect to be faulty,
and retrofitting a similar analysis to arrive
at a reduction in prior obligations. Moreover,
adding conversions and demolitions
as calculated by Dr. Kinsey again significantly
inflates Gap Present Need above
the number of gap period LMI households
he asserts was created during the period.
As noted above, such a result makes no
sense to the court. To the extent Dr. Kinsey
made these adjustments as a way to
address the circumstances he described
concerning cost-burdened LMI households
that formed during the gap, Dr. Kinsey
and Mr. Bernard admitted that COAH had
never included this consideration in any of
its fair share housing models, largely due
to the complexities and imponderables
such consideration would entail. Finally,
the court simply lacks confidence that such
adjustments make sense in the context of
Gap Present Need. Should similar circumstances
arise in the future, the court hopes
a reconstituted agency will be available to
evaluate important policy considerations
underlying the necessary retrospective
analysis. For present purposes, however,
the court rejects secondary source adjustments
when calculating Gap Present Need.

<HN20>3. Dr. Angelides' Adjustments

<P20>Dr. Angelides responded creatively to
the concerns expressed by the Supreme
Court in <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU> and fashioned
three novel adjustments for the court's
consideration. While the court was at first
attracted by Dr. Angelides' adjustments as
facially responsive to the Supreme Court's
comments concerning the
<SPage 211>
characteristics of Gap Present Need,
227 N.J. at 526-31, 152 A.3d 915, closer
scrutiny caused the court to lose confidence
in many aspects of the reductions in
Present Need that he advocated. Although
the court does not adopt his proposals to
reduce Gap Present Need for gap period
LMI households that found affordable
housing or gap period LMI households
with significant housing assets, the court
did find his adjustment for traditional
Present Need overlap to be valid as modified.

<CN>a. LMI households living in
affordable housing

<P20>The first adjustment undertaken
by Dr. Angelides to translate gap period
LMI household growth into Gap Present
Need was to exclude those LMI households,
formed during the gap period, that
were living "in a housing unit affordable to
their income strata (as defined in the Fair
Housing Act) in 2015, provided the household
is not overcrowded within the unit (as
defined in COAH's Present Need standard)."
Angelides Gap Rpt. (April 12,
2017), Ex. P 86 at 28. However, because
there was no data source that specifically
identified which 2015 LMI households
were formed during the gap period, Dr.
Angelides made his estimation by assuming
that the same proportion of 2015 gap
period LMI households would be in affordable
units as was the case for all 2015 LMI
households in affordable housing. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 29
n.34.

<P20>Dr. Angelides utilized 2015 ACS PUMS
data to categorize each LMI household by
its income status "strata" (moderate, low,
<Page 592>
or very low-income) and then compared
the households in each strata with the
affordability of the unit in which they were
residing to determine those LMI households
that were living in affordable housing
in 2015. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 29-30. Dr. Angelides
then removed those households living in
overcrowded units, as defined in traditional
Present Need methodology, to avoid
double counting. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 30-31. From these
calculations, Dr. Angelides next determined
the proportion of all 2015 LMI
households in each region and household
size to be living in affordable housing, and
then applied those proportions to his estimated
gap period LMI households to reduce
<SPage 212>
Gap Present Need. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 31-32.
Dr. Angelides' adjustments in this step,
aggregated by region and statewide, demonstrate
significant reductions in gap period
LMI households in need of affordable
housing in 2015:

Non-Overcrowded Affordable Housing

<B22>[Angelides Gap Rpt., (April 12, 2017),
Ex. P 86 at 32.]

<P20>Both Dr. Kinsey and Mr. Bernard took
issue with this adjustment to Gap Present
Need. Both of these experts found Dr.
Angelides' "strata" approach to calculating
the number of gap period LMI households
that found affordable housing to be flawed,
and concluded that, regardless of the accuracy
of his figures, the households he identified
did not represent satisfaction of gap
period affordable housing need. Both Dr.
Kinsey and Mr. Bernard testified that Dr.
Angelides overstated the households living
in affordable housing because he compared
each LMI household's actual housing costs
to the maximum affordable housing costs
for households at the highest qualifying
LMI income, rather than to the maximum
housing costs based on each household's
actual income. When Dr. Kinsey reportedly
reproduced Dr. Angelides' approach in
this step, but determined affordability
based on each household's actual income,
total LMI households living in affordable
housing were less than half the number
<SPage 213>
calculated by Dr. Angelides. Kinsey Gap
Rpt. (April 12, 2017), Ex. DF 95a at 1.

<P20>Dr. Kinsey and Mr. Bernard further
challenged the accuracy of Dr. Angelides'
calculations, specifically questioning the
manner in which he estimated the number
of gap period LMI households in affordable
housing by applying the proportions of
total gap period LMI households in affordable
<Page 593>
housing to gap period LMI household
growth. Both experts asserted that the
application of these proportions was based
on the faulty assumption that newly established
gap period LMI households would
be able to find affordable housing at the
same rate as already established LMI
households. Mr. Bernard considered this
assumption to be counterintuitive given the
diminishing affordable housing choices
available during the gap period, which included
the Great Recession. In addition,
Dr. Kinsey pointed out that Dr. Angelides
mixed income requirements in a novel and
troubling way, utilizing true median incomes
for his calculations that have been
rejected by the court, but also introducing
consideration of HUD standards he had
spurned in other instances in his methodology
and accepting only portions of UHAC
regulations. Dr. Kinsey characterized the
process as using a "hodge-podge affordability
definition ... that mixes and
matches different standards and definitions."
Kinsey Response Gap Rpt. (April
24, 2017), Ex. DF 86 at 17. Dr. Kinsey
asserted that such mixing was inherently
unreliable.

<P20>In the strata approach Dr. Angelides
used to reduce Gap Present Need, he essentially
sorted LMI households living in
cost-burdened housing in 2015 from those
households that were not cost-burdened.
Mr. Bernard questioned the results of this
method to reduce need, citing census-based
HUD data to show an increase in
cost-burdened households in New Jersey
during the gap period. Cost-burdened
households are those that spend over a set
percentage of their incomes for housing,
ranging from twenty-eight percent to over
thirty percent. Mr. Bernard's data showed
that there was a total increase in cost-burdened
households from about sixty-one
percent to seventy-five percent during the
gap period,
<SPage 214>
and that the increase in
LMI households that were cost-burdened
between 2000 and 2010 was more than
three times the number of LMI households
created during the gap. Bernard Gap
Rpt. (April 12, 2017), Ex. DB 47. Mr.
Bernard testified that these figures
showed a significant loss of affordable
housing over the gap period, most of which
he attributed to gentrification. As a result
of these circumstances, Mr. Bernard asserted
that, while some LMI households
did find affordable housing during the gap
period, far more LMI households lost affordable
housing as their incomes declined.
Mr. Bernard therefore concluded that any
gap period LMI households that found
affordable housing did not represent a satisfaction
of "pent-up affordable housing
need," pursuant to <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, and
should therefore not be used to reduce
Gap Present Need.

<P20>Both Dr. Kinsey and Mr. Bernard further
criticized the reduction in Gap Present
Need for gap period LMI households
that found deed-restricted affordable housing
during the period as being redundant.
While the adjustment made by Dr. Angelides
included gap period LMI households
in both deed restricted and non-deed-restricted
units, reductions in municipal obligations
for creation of deed-restricted affordable
housing are applied as credits
during the compliance process. Therefore,
to avoid double counting, both Dr. Kinsey
and Mr. Bernard recommended that if any
municipal housing obligations were to be
reduced for gap period LMI households
that found deed-restricted affordable housing,
such deductions should only be accomplished
through municipal bonus credits
awarded during the compliance process.

<P20>Special Master Reading endorsed Dr.
Angelides' adjustment, concluding that his
approach was well-reasoned and supported
by available data sources. Mr. Reading
responded to Mr. Bernard's concern regarding
increases in New Jersey's cost-burdened
households during the gap period
<Page 594>
by noting that Judge Serpentelli in
<EMU>AMG</EMU>, 207 N.J. Super. at 422-23, 504 A.2d
692, had rejected incorporating cost-burdened
households in the calculation of
Present Need, and COAH and other
courts had agreed with this
<SPage 215>
conclusion.
Mr. Reading did, however, concur with the
criticisms expressed by Dr. Kinsey and
Mr. Bernard regarding the exclusion of
LMI households living in deed-restricted
affordable housing because to include them
would be redundant since municipalities
receive credits for those units toward satisfaction
of their fair share obligations during
the compliance process. Excluding
deed-restricted units would prevent double
counting those units. Reading Final Gap
Rpt., (June 12, 2017), Ex. SM 11 at 20. As
a result, Mr. Reading proposed that the
2,368 LMI households he calculated as living
in deed-restricted affordable housing
remain included in Gap Present Need to
avoid the possibility of double counting. <EMU>Id.</EMU>

<P20>The court concurs with Special Master
Reading that COAH rejected consideration
of cost-burdened households in calculating
municipal affordable housing obligations,
and that its decision was upheld by the
Appellate Division as a permissible exercise
of discretion. <EMU>In Re Adoption of
N.J.A.C. 5:94 & 5:95</EMU>, 390 N.J. Super. at 36,
914 A.2d 348. Such considerations cannot
drive the calculation of Gap Present Need
despite the challenging circumstances experienced
by such LMI households that
formed during the gap period. Further,
while the court appreciates Dr. Angelides'
effort to restrict Gap Present Need to
those households "still in need of affordable
housing" in response to language used
by the Supreme Court in <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>,
227 N.J. at 528-31, 152 A.3d 915, the court
is not convinced that those households
identified by Dr. Angelides in this step
reliably represent a reduction in gap period
<SPage 216>
need.
The court was troubled by the
compelling criticisms of Dr. Kinsey and
Mr. Bernard, which were based on statistical
evidence they provided that called the
deductions taken by Dr. Angelides into
question. Moreover, reductions in Gap
Present Need based on an analysis of cost-burdened
households, as this adjustment
appeared to be, are at odds with COAH
and judicial precedent rejecting such considerations
in prior methodologies. The
court also remained unconvinced that the
strata approach utilized by Dr. Angelides
was reliable, especially as it was not based
on the COAH income grid and mixed affordability
criteria.

<P20>In <EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU>, the Supreme Court
specifically identified COAH's exclusion of
cost-burdened households from Present
Need calculations as having been judicially
approved and among the policies for trial
courts to follow in fashioning their fair
share methodologies:

<B22>[I]n addressing the first iteration of
Third Round Rules, the Appellate Division
also approved the "exclu[sion of]
<Page 595>
the cost-burdened poor from the present
need or rehabilitation share calculation."
In doing so, the appellate panel noted
that pre-FHA courts also had allowed
exclusion of the "cost-burdened poor"
from the fair share formula. The court
found that COAH's decision to exclude
the cost-burdened poor was a permissible
exercise of discretion.

<B22>[<EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU>, 221 N.J. at 32-33, 110
A.3d 31 (citations omitted).]

<P00>COAH's Prior Round rules largely
adopted the approach developed in <EMU>AMG</EMU>,
207 N.J. Super. at 422-423, 504 A.2d 692,
which excluded consideration of cost-burdened
households from the calculation of
Present Need. The Appellate Division concurred
with this conclusion in <EMU>In re Adoption
of N.J.A.C. 5:94 & 5:95</EMU>, 390 N.J.
Super. at 23, 35, 914 A.2d 348, which justified
the exclusion primarily on the difficulty
of accurately calculating the number of
cost-burdened households. Drawing largely
from Judge Serpentelli's analysis, the
appellate court reasoned as follows:

<B22>First, many people do not fully report
their income. Second, some people, by
choice, pay "a disproportionate amount
of their income for housing." Third,
some people choose lesser quality housing
than they can afford, thereby creating
a housing "mismatch." If household
unit income and housing unit cost were
more closely correlated, more units
would be available for needy families.
Fourth, many retirees who have lower
incomes nonetheless have substantial assets.
Fifth, the needs of lower income
households could be met more appropriately
through income
<SPage 217>
maintenance
programs rather than revision of land
use regulations. Sixth, many of the cost-burdened
poor also occupy substandard
units, thereby creating a duplication in
the present need count.

<B22>[<EMU>In re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:94</EMU>, 390
N.J. Super. at 35, 914 A.2d 348 (citations
omitted).]

<P00><EMU>See also</EMU> 36 N.J.R. 5798, 5809-10 (Dec. 20,
2004) (wherein COAH specifically provided
additional policy-based justifications for
the exclusion as part of the notice and
comment process).

<P20>In using cost-burdened concepts to exclude
gap period LMI households from
Gap Present Need, Dr. Angelides thus
ventured into territory COAH had assiduously
avoided. And in criticizing his adjustment,
Dr. Kinsey and Mr. Bernard also
made arguments based on cost-burdened
concepts. Without guidance from COAH
and the appellate courts as to how such
concepts might appropriately be incorporated
into any calculation of municipal obligations,
this court is unwilling to endorse
an approach based on an analysis of cost-burdened
households, especially one where
the testimony of the experts was so sharply
conflicting. Indeed, Dr. Angelides' adjustment
is susceptible to all of the potential
inaccuracies connected with a cost-burdened
analysis highlighted in <EMU>AMG</EMU>,
and the appellate cases that concurred in
Judge Serpentelli's reasoning.

<P20>Although Gap Present Need is a new
addition to the fair share methodology, the
court remained skeptical that cost-burdened
concepts could be incorporated into
determining a "fair estimate" of that Need.
The bottom line is that the adjustment as
structured by Dr. Angelides is simply too
unreliable to be accepted by the court to
significantly dilute Gap Present Need. Accepting
this adjustment would run afoul of
well-established COAH precedent based
on the inherent lack of reliability in such
an analysis.

<P20>Furthermore, other aspects of Dr. Angelides'
approach raise even more questions
about his calculations. First, to estimate
the number of LMI households in
<Page 596>
affordable housing that formed during the
gap period, Dr. Angelides assumed that
the proportion of those gap period LMI
households that found affordable housing
would be the same as the proportion of all
2015 LMI households in affordable housing.
While this approach may appear reasonable
<SPage 218>
at first glance, it assumes that
gap period LMI households were able to
acquire affordable housing during the gap
period at the same rate as all LMI households.
The court, however, shares the concerns
raised by Mr. Bernard that it is
counterintuitive to assume that the relatively
new LMI households formed during
the gap period would have the same level
of access to affordable housing opportunities
as those LMI households established
before 1999. Those households in LMI status
for longer periods of time would likely
be more familiar with the processes to find
and qualify for affordable housing and may
already have been living in affordable units
for considerable periods of time. To the
extent that some percentage of LMI
households are living in owner-occupied
residences, the ability of newer formed
LMI households to purchase property
would likely not match their more established
counterparts. These concerns cause
the court to further doubt the reliability of
Dr. Angelides' proposed adjustment.

<P20>Second, although Mr. Reading found Dr.
Angelides' overall approach to be reasonable,
the court is concerned with his use of
"strata" to determine housing affordability.
The court agrees with Dr. Kinsey and Mr.
Bernard that setting housing affordability
thresholds from the maximum incomes for
each strata, rather than using the actual
incomes of each household, tends to inflate
the number of households in affordable
housing. Dr. Angelides' strata approach is
especially puzzling considering that PUMS
data can be used to compare each household's
actual income to the cost of the
housing they occupy. In addition, Dr. Kinsey
and Mr. Bernard presented further
credible evidence to make the court question
the propriety of Dr. Angelides' mixing
and matching of income standards from
the UHAC, HUD, and his own methodology
based on true medians, raising the distinct
possibility that his estimate of gap
period LMI households living in affordable
housing was significantly inflated. Kinsey
Rpt. (May 17, 2016), Ex. DF 86 at 16.

<P20>The court also had serious misgivings
about the proposed adjustment due to the
likely negative ramifications of Dr. Angelides'
reductions on the fair share municipal
compliance process.
<SPage 219>
Notably, Dr. Angelides
reiterated often during the trial that
he had no expertise in the process through
which towns design and adopt fair share
plans to comply with their affordable housing
obligations. So it was not surprising
that he did not appear to realize or to be
concerned about the likely impact on the
compliance process of his proposed adjustment
that removed from Gap Present
Need those gap period LMI households
living in deed-restricted units.

<P20>When developing fair share plans to respond
to the identified affordable housing
need, municipalities can obtain credits toward
their affordable housing obligations
from the creation of deed-restricted affordable
housing units. COAH relied upon a
well-established system of "bonus credits"
in the compliance process to incentivize
towns to take various actions such as approving
inclusionary developments, constructing
affordable housing units for very-low
income households, making family
rental units available, or providing affordable
units in designated redevelopment or
rehabilitation areas. <EMU>See, e.g.</EMU>, <EMU>Mount Laurel
IV</EMU>, 221 N.J. at 31-32, 110 A.3d 31.

<P20>The court agrees with Mr. Bernard and
Mr. Reading that Dr. Angelides' adjustment
could very well result in deed-restricted
<Page 597>
housing being counted twice toward
the satisfaction of a town's obligation,
and thus improperly diluting the need. To
avoid this double counting would require
the modification of the compliance process,
which in turn would deprive municipalities
of credits for deed-restricted housing constructed
during the gap period and now
occupied by gap period LMI households.
Such a modification would also benefit municipalities
that did not actually build affordable
housing units during the gap by
reducing their Gap Present Need obligations.
Adopting this approach would interfere
with COAH's well-established compliance
process and thwart the reasonable
expectations of municipalities that have
been relying on credits in developing their
Third Round fair share plans through settlements,
many of which have already been
approved throughout New Jersey, including
several by this court.
<SPage 220>

<P20>Perhaps most importantly, however,
is that disallowing credits for towns where
affordable housing was developed in the
gap period would undermine the special
treatment accorded to them by the Supreme
Court in <EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU>, 221 N.J.
at 21-27, 110 A.3d 31. <EMU>See also Mount
Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 523-25, 152 A.3d 915
(describing rationale behind "the Court's
different, and better, treatment of towns
that had already started taking meaningful
steps toward compliance during [the gap]
period," and thus had "willingly accepted
responsibility for the need arising while
COAH worked to adopt controlling rules
for that very time period and going forward").
Such a result cannot be countenanced.
To avoid double-counting and to
preserve the well-established expectations
of municipalities engaged in the compliance
process thus constitute yet additional
reasons for the court to reject Dr. Angelides'
proposed removal from Gap Present
Need of LMI gap households that found
deed-restricted affordable housing between
1999 and 2015. While deed-restricted
housing was only a subset of the proposed
adjustment, the negative effect of
this adjustment on the compliance process
further erodes the court's confidence in the
methodology advocated by Dr. Angelides.
In short, the court rejects the adjustment
to remove gap households living in affordable
housing from Gap Present Need because
it is too unreliable and threatens to
significantly and inappropriately dilute
municipal new construction obligations for
the gap period.

<CN>b. LMI Households with Significant
Housing Assets

<P20>For his second adjustment, Dr.
Angelides reprised the significant asset
test from his Prospective Need calculations.
Reading Final Gap Rpt. (June 12,
2017), Ex. SM 11 at 12. Utilizing 2015 ACS
PUMS data, Dr. Angelides excluded those
LMI households that owned their own
homes with no mortgage, had total housing
costs of less than 38 percent of their income,
and their primary residence had a
value in excess of the regional asset limit
published by COAH. Mr. Reading recorded
the results of this adjustment in his
report to the court:

<C5><EMU>Gap Period LMI Households with Significant
Assets</EMU>

</T>
<B22>[<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 13.]

<P20>The court reiterates its rejection of a
significant asset test for the same reasons
expressed in the Prospective Need analysis
and agrees with Special Master Reading
that such a test should be included
only as part of a comprehensive re-evaluation
of the entire fair share methodology
by COAH, and not adopted as an isolated
policy that would reduce affordable housing
need without considering off-setting
factors. While the test is a reasonable one,
COAH only considered adding it to the
methodology in the various iterations of
the Third Round when it also adopted
changes that somewhat balanced the reductions
in need anticipated from the asset
test with new requirements that would
increase the overall need. This issue thus
remains one better left to the Executive
and Legislative branches, hopefully to be
addressed in the future by a reconstituted
and functioning COAH.

<CN>c. Overlap with Traditional Present Need

<P20>Dr. Angelides' third and final adjustment
before allocating regional Gap
Present Need to the municipalities was to
remove those gap period LMI households
already included in traditional Present
Need calculations, specifically those gap
period LMI households living in deficient
units as of July 1, 2015. Angelides Gap
Rpt. (April 12, 2017), Ex. P 86 at 35. In
endorsing this "overlap" adjustment, Dr.
Angelides emphasized the Supreme
Court's caution to "avoid double-counting"
when calculating Gap Present Need. <EMU>Ibid.
See Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227 N.J. at 531, 152
A.3d 915.
<SPage 222>

<P20>Dr. Angelides utilized 2015 ACS
PUMS data to identify the gap period
LMI households with identifiable housing
need that he had not previously excluded
for living in affordable housing or having
significant assets that were living in deficient
housing, by region and household
size. Angelides Gap Rpt. (April 12, 2017),
Ex. P 86 at 35-36. In performing these
calculations, Dr. Angelides utilized the
same three surrogates for deficient housing
that he had used in his Present Need
calculations: units with inadequate plumbing
facilities, units with inadequate kitchen
facilities, or units that are both old and
overcrowded. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> Mr. Reading summarized
the application of this adjustment in
the following chart:

<C5><EMU>Gap Period LMI Households Captured

   Region 4           7,790         (431)       -5.5%
</T>
<B22>[Reading Final Gap Rpt. (June 12, 2017),
Ex. SM 11 at 14.]

<P20>After initially rejecting this adjustment,
Mr. Bernard testified that a step addressing
the overlap between traditional Present
Need and Gap Present Need could
have merit. But Mr. Bernard recommended
that Dr. Angelides' adjustment be
modified to not remove the sixty-two percent
of gap period LMI households in deficient
housing located in QUAMs because
including them would not result in double
counting since urban aid municipalities do
not have a new construction obligation.
Mr. Bernard reasoned that, without a new
construction obligation, QUAMs would not
receive both a traditional Present Need
rehabilitation obligation and a Gap Present
Need new construction obligation for the
same LMI Household. According to Mr.
Bernard's interpretation of <EMU>Mount Laurel
V</EMU>, a prohibited overlap occurs only when
redundant traditional Present Need and
Gap Present Need obligations are allocated
to the same municipality. However, Mr.
Bernard acknowledged that excluding
QUAMs from this adjustment, as he proposed,
could theoretically result in a deficient
unit being rehabilitated in a
<SPage 223>
QUAM and a new unit being built elsewhere
in the region for the same gap
period LMI household.

<P20>Special Master Reading concluded that
Dr. Angelides' traditional Present Need
overlap calculation represented a reasonable
and necessary adjustment to Gap
Present Need, and was explicitly contemplated
by the Supreme Court in <EMU>Mount
Laurel V</EMU>. Reading Final Gap Rpt. (June
12, 2017), Ex. SM 11 at 22. Mr. Reading
also agreed with Mr. Bernard's recommendation
that traditional Present Need in
QUAMs not be removed from the calculation
of Gap Present Need because these
municipalities do not receive allocations of
Gap Present Need. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> Mr. Reading estimated
that 61.80 percent of statewide and
28.30 percent of Region 4 traditional Present
Need was located in QUAMs. Mr.
Reading recommended excluding these
percentages from the adjustment, resulting
in a decrease in Dr. Angelides' overlap
of 2,055 units. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 22-24.

<P20>The court concurs with the recommendations
of Mr. Bernard and Mr. Reading
to modify Dr. Angelides' adjustment to
remove the deduction for Present Need in
QUAMs. First, the court's focus in Gap
Present Need is in determining a new
construction obligation for Princeton and
West Windsor. Since their respective traditional
Present Needs will be deducted
from their Gap Present Need obligations,
those towns will be not be responsible to
rehabilitate a unit and also provide a unit
of new construction for the same Gap LMI
household. That is the overlap that concerned
the Supreme Court, which was examining
a new construction obligation
when it created Gap Present Need. Since
QUAMs do not have any new construction
need, the Supreme Court did not discuss
their special status in <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, nor
did the Court mention urban aid municipalities
at all when identifying the overlap
with traditional Present Need that trial
courts should avoid. <EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>, 227
<Page 600>
N.J. at 531, 152 A.3d 915. If gap period
LMI households in deficient housing are
excluded from Mercer County's new construction
obligation, those households may
be deprived of an opportunity to access
affordable housing in the region outside of
Trenton. That result seems at odds with
the intent of
<SPage 224>
the Supreme Court in
<EMU>Mount Laurel V</EMU>. Moreover, COAH itself
recognized that excess Present Need
should be reallocated out of urban areas
that had higher than average substandard
units. N.J.A.C. 5:93-2.4; N.J.A.C. 5:93-2.5;
26 N.J.R. 2346-47 (June 6, 1994). Reducing
the adjustment for overlap with Present
Need to remove the Present Need in
QUAMs strikes the court as consistent
with the policies underlying COAH's regulations
providing for the reallocation of
Present Need from urban areas with large
amounts of deficient housing to other municipalities.

<P20>The court agrees with Special Master
Reading that Dr. Angelides has submitted
a reasonable approach for the Present
Need overlap adjustment, to be modified
to exclude the Present Need in QUAMs.
Since Dr. Angelides incorporated the adjustment
for traditional Present Need as
part of a sequence that relied upon his
first two adjustments that the court has
rejected, the court directed Mr. Reading to
apply the Present Need adjustment, minus
Present Need in QUAMs. As modified, the
results of the adjustment are reflected in
the following chart:

<P20>Dr. Angelides allocated Gap Present
Need to the municipalities in the same
proportions he used to allocate Prospective
Need, which he calculated based on each
municipality's proportional share of his
Prospective Need phase allocation factors.
However, since the court adopted Dr. Kinsey's
approach to allocating Prospective
<SPage 225>
Need to the municipalities, for the same
reasons expressed previously and for the
sake of consistency, the court will likewise
use Dr. Kinsey's approach to allocate Gap
Present Need here and directed Mr. Reading
to make the appropriate allocations for
Princeton and West Windsor.

<CN>VI. Consolidated Affordable
Housing Obligations

<P20>A municipality's affordable housing obligations
include its Prior Round Obligations,
Traditional Present Need, Prospective
Need, and Gap Present Need.
However, before these final calculations
can be made, municipal new construction
obligations required to satisfy Prospective
Need and Gap Present Need for the Third
Round are subject to further adjustment.
Pursuant to COAH Second Round methodology,
a municipality's new construction
obligations in any one housing cycle may
not exceed a cap defined by twenty percent
<Page 601>
of the municipality's occupied housing,
N.J.A.C. 5:93-2.16., while the FHA authorizes
a cap on municipal prospective need of
1,000 units for a ten-year period. N.J.S.A.
52:27D-307(e). However, since all parties
have agreed that application of the 1000-unit
cap must await the compliance process
for each municipality, the court need
only decide the appropriate application of
the twenty percent cap at this time.

<P20>As noted in N.J.A.C. 5:93-2.16, application
of the twenty percent cap prevents
a new construction obligation that
would exceed twenty percent of the estimated
occupied housing stock at the beginning
of the Prospective Need period for
any municipality. The cap was developed
with the inclusionary housing strategy in
mind, which typically requires a set-aside
of twenty percent of all units provided by
the private housing market to be deed-restricted
for occupancy by LMI households.
As noted in the Second Round rules,
"if the affordable housing was provided as
a 20 percent set-aside of inclusionary housing,
and if the planned affordable housing
was more than 20 percent of existing units,
then the new affordable housing and accompanying
market units would exceed the
number of existing housing units in the
community." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> COAH determined that
such a result would be undesirable, and
<SPage 226>
thus imposed the cap in the Second
Round. As noted by COAH, "[t]he derivation
of this limitation reflects a desire by
COAH not to overwhelm local communities
with affordable housing activities such that
the community would experience `drastic
alteration' from these activities." 26 N.J.R.
2350 (June 6, 1994) (codified at N.J.A.C.
5:93 app. A). COAH termed the calculation
of the cap as an effort to respect "community
capacity" in establishing municipal affordable
housing obligations.

<HN02>A. Calculate and Apply Twenty Percent
Cap

<P20>With the incorporation of Gap
Present Need into the fair share methodology,
an issue has arisen as to how the
twenty percent cap should be applied with
respect to the total municipal new construction
obligations. Dr. Angelides proposed
that because Gap Present Need, unlike
traditional Present Need, constitutes a
new construction obligation, the twenty
percent cap should be applied to the combined
totals of Gap Present Need and Prospective
Need for the Third Round. Angelides
Gap Rpt. (April 12, 2017), Ex. P 86 at
47. By contrast, Dr. Kinsey proposed that
Gap Present Need and Prospective Need
each be subject to the twenty percent cap
separately. Kinsey Gap Rpt. (April 12,
2017), Ex. DF 85 at 70. Since Prospective
Need and Gap Present Need impose a
combined new construction obligation for
the Third Round, the tewnty percent cap
should be applied to the combined total to
fulfill COAH's intent in adopting N.J.A.C.
5:93-2.16, which is to prevent the "drastic
alteration" of a community from the housing
need imposed in a single round. The
court, therefore, adopts Dr. Angelides' approach
in this step and will apply the
twenty percent cap to each municipality's
combined Gap Present Need and Prospective
Need new construction obligations.
Notably, however, the cap does not apply
to either Princeton or West Windsor's
combined new construction obligation and
thus is not a matter of dispute in regard to
Mercer County. Application of the twenty
percent cap statewide is demonstrated below
for illustrative purposes.

<CN>VII. Housing Market Analysis

<P20>While not addressing any particular aspect
of the fair share methodology, the
court allowed testimony and evidence to be
presented regarding the housing market in
New Jersey and the ability of that market
to create affordable housing through 2025.
The municipalities relied on the testimony
of Dr. Robert Powell to support their contention
that the obligation recommended
by Dr. Kinsey and FSHC was much too
aggressive to be achieved and should be
rejected on that basis. His testimony was
intended to show that the fair share obligation
advocated by FSHC and NJBA was
unrealistic when analyzed against the likely
pace of residential development in the
next decade. Notably, however, Dr. Powell
addressed only the inclusionary zoning
strategy and its "effectiveness and limitations"
in satisfying municipal affordable
housing obligations. Indeed, he testified
that the League of Municipalities had retained
him to prepare reports focusing on
the limitations of that single mechanism to
<Page 603>
create affordable housing in New Jersey
through 2025.

<P20>Dr. Powell testified that inclusionary
zoning depends on a bargain between municipalities
and private developers whereby
towns will grant increased residential densities
in return for developers providing
affordable units, typically at a set-aside of
twenty percent of the total units. While
that bargain is often attractive to municipalities
because affordable units can be
created without municipal financing, it depends
on the willingness of private developers
to invest substantial capital in the
New Jersey housing market&mdash;something
developers will do only if they determine it
is financially beneficial to do so.

<P20>Dr. Powell prepared reports on the likely
amount of affordable housing that could
be absorbed by the housing market
through inclusionary developments between
the present and 2025. He studied
housing data in terms of residential building
permits issued from 1990 through
2010, as well as population and employment
data over the same period. He noted
that his projections took into account the
slow recovery from the Great Recession
that
<SPage 229>
had characterized the New Jersey
economy, which dampened his estimates
for job and population growth in the State
over the next decade. He concluded that
current economic factors would prevent
the development of a robust housing market
from now until 2025. His estimates
were based on an assumption that sixty
percent of new residential development in
New Jersey in the next decade would involve
inclusionary projects. Dr. Powell also
noted that recent trends in the housing
market showed increased activity in urban
areas and less interest in suburban communities,
although he did admit that this
trend was not particularly pronounced in
Region 4 or in Mercer County. Overall,
however, he stated that recent years
showed a significant increase in multi-family
new construction and a decrease in
large-lot single family homes as a percentage
of total new development.

<P20>Based on his research, and due to uncertainties
in the housing market that made
him hesitant to endorse only one estimate,
Dr. Powell created three alternative projections,
labelling them Very Aggressive,
Optimistic, and Achievable, as reflected in
the following chart at P-32, slide 9:

</T>
<P20>Throughout his testimony, Dr. Powell
focused on the amount of inclusionary development
that he thought was reasonably
likely to occur over the next decade. He
was particularly disturbed that the methodologies
proposed by Drs. Angelides and
Kinsey were created in what he perceived
to be a vacuum divorced from the reality
of the housing market. While he agreed
that there is a significant need for affordable
housing in New Jersey, he saw a "disconnect"
between any fair share methodology
and reality when the methodology did
not consider the current characteristics of
the housing market and the likelihood that
sufficient new construction would be built
to satisfy the fair share needs calculated
by each methodology expert.

<P20>Mr. Jeffrey Otteau also testified for
NJBA as an expert regarding the New
Jersey housing market, and opined that
the projections of Dr. Powell were too low.
Mr. Otteau criticized Dr. Powell's forecasts
for not adjusting the data to minimize the
effect of the Great Recession, which reflected
an extreme disruption in the housing
market and not baseline trends. He
stated that he thought the market could
easily achieve the number of affordable
units through inclusionary projects that
Dr. Powell had categorized as
<SPage 231>
"Optimistic" based on the performance
of the market over the last three years. In
fact, he stated that the pent-up need for
affordable housing created during the gap
period would increase the demand for affordable
housing in the next decade.
Where Dr. Powell had estimated that an
aggressive market through 2025 would
produce an average of 40,000 residential
building permits a year, which was his
maximum number, Mr. Otteau countered
that an average of 50,000 building permits
could be achieved during the same period.
Mr. Otteau noted that more permits than
that had been issued in 1986 and a return
to a robust housing market was possible in
the foreseeable future, especially since the
post-Recession recovery had accelerated in
New Jersey and was likely to continue
improving at a healthy rate.

<P20>Through cross-examination of Dr. Powell
and testimony from Dr. Kinsey, who
<Page 605>
was also accepted as an expert in the New
Jersey housing market, especially in regard
to the development of affordable
housing, it became apparent that Dr. Powell's
testimony had limited utility. First,
Dr. Powell focused exclusively on satisfying
the affordable housing need through
new construction provided by inclusionary
zoning projects. While that mechanism had
been the primary tool used to satisfy municipal
obligations in the years immediately
following the first <EMU>Mount Laurel</EMU> decision,
100 percent affordable units have
surpassed the inclusionary mechanism in
providing affordable housing since that
time. Dr. Powell simply did not consider
those projects in his analysis of the ability
of the housing market to satisfy the need
for LMI housing in the Prospective Need
period. He did acknowledge, however, that
they were a very effective way to provide
affordable housing in New Jersey and had
a proven track record. He remarked that
such projects typically depended upon developers
qualifying for tax credits, which
was beyond the control of the municipality
and thus not as reliable in satisfying municipal
obligations as inclusionary developments.
He also noted that changes in tax
policy could affect the likelihood of this
mechanism remaining viable.
<SPage 232>

<P20>Dr. Powell also had not considered
how municipalities could meet fair share
obligations by extending affordability controls
on existing units, by qualifying for
bonus credits for the creation of past and
future affordable units, by utilizing Affordable
Housing Trust funds supported by
developer contributions to help create affordable
units, and by instituting market-to-affordable
programs through which
towns use public funds to acquire market
rate housing and then subsidize converting
those units into affordable residences. Nor
did he consider that mobile home parks
could be considered as another mechanism
to satisfy affordable housing need. Indeed,
Dr. Powell admitted that he was not an
expert in municipal compliance strategies
to meet affordable housing obligations, and
stressed repeatedly that his opinions were
limited to inclusionary projects only, which
was the assignment he had been given by
the League of Municipalities. Notably, he
is not a professional planner, but rather
focuses on the financial and economic side
of the real estate market.

<P20>In terms of his projections, Dr. Powell
acknowledged that Rutgers was predicting
building permits rising to an average of
30,000 per year in the next few years, an
amount between his Optimistic and Aggressive
projections. Although he had relied
on studies produced by Rutgers in
preparing his own reports, he disagreed
with the Rutgers forecast regarding building
permits, characterizing it as too aggressive.
Moreover, Dr. Powell had refused
to consider the poorest of the low
income households in his study of inclusionary
developments because he concluded
that they could not afford even the
most affordable inclusionary units. According
to Dr. Kinsey, this approach failed to
consider that many very low income households
qualify for vouchers that can be used
to subsidize rents in inclusionary projects.

<P20>Dr. Kinsey provided testimony based on
his analysis of data that he obtained from
COAH that fifty-seven percent of affordable
housing units created in New Jersey
under the <EMU>Mount Laurel</EMU> doctrine had been
developed through 100 percent affordable
projects, and twenty-eight percent of the
units had been created
<SPage 233>
through inclusionary
developments. He expects both
mechanisms to be significant sources of
new affordable housing during the Third
Round Prospective Need period. This evidence
showed that Dr. Powell had been
mistaken in concluding that inclusionary
developments were the primary mechanism
over time used by municipalities to
<Page 606>
satisfy their affordable housing obligations.
Based on his familiarity with the compliance
process, which spans more than three
decades, Dr. Kinsey estimated that towns
will be able to satisfy approximately twenty
percent of their obligations through the
use of bonus credits. Notably, that estimate
was based on an analysis of the
settlement agreements FSHC has entered
with over 100 municipalities since <EMU>Mount
Laurel IV</EMU> was decided in 2015 and over
350 municipalities filed declaratory judgment
actions seeking substantive certification
of their housing plans from the trial
courts. Dr. Kinsey also noted that Dr.
Powell had ignored vacant land adjustments,
through which largely developed
municipalities can seek a reduction in their
affordable housing obligations due to the
unavailability of vacant land for new residential
development. In addition, Dr. Powell
had not examined durational adjustments
in affordable housing obligations
that towns can seek based upon the lack of
infrastructure necessary for development,
such as lack of utilities, including sewers.

<P20>For the Third Round Prospective Need
period addressed in these proceedings, Dr.
Kinsey used Dr. Powell's "Optimistic" estimate
that 24,000 new affordable units
could be built through inclusionary projects,
and created a chart he labelled "How
the Prospective Need Can Be Met," submitted
into evidence at Ex. DF 61, slide 6.
The chart estimates that Dr. Kinsey's affordable
housing need number of 163,653
for the Prospective Need period would
lead to construction of 48,865 new units,
with the balance of the obligation being
addressed through other compliance mechanisms,
discounts offered through settlements
with FSHC, or attributed to municipalities
that have opted not to participate
in declaratory judgment proceedings filed
in the wake of <EMU>Mount Laurel IV</EMU>. This
chart illustrates how Dr. Kinsey concluded
that his statewide Prospective Need obligation
of 163,653 could be met:
<Page 607>
<SPage 234>

<P00><IMAGE></IMAGE>

<P00>In discussing this chart, Dr. Kinsey noted
that municipalities can use all available
compliance mechanisms recognized by
COAH to meet that obligation, and that
the obligation does not require that it be
satisfied only through the construction of
new units. He also emphasized, however,
that satisfying municipal obligations
through new construction combined with
various compliance strategies that do not
require building new units underscores
how a higher obligation will provide a
greater opportunity for the construction of
more affordable units than a lower number.
<SPage 235>

<P20>In fact, he utilized some of the municipal
numbers recommended by Dr. Angelides
to show that certain towns, including
West Windsor in Mercer County, could
satisfy the need attributed to them by Dr.
Angelides without producing any new units
whatsoever. The court does note, however,
<Page 608>
that the chart shows satisfaction of some
of the Prospective Need number by reductions
in municipal obligations agreed to
through court-approved settlements between
Fair Share Housing Center and various
municipalities.

<P20>Finally, Dr. Kinsey asserted that while
it would be beneficial if all new construction
contained in municipal compliance
plans approved by the courts would be
built within the Prospective Need period,
COAH never required that outcome. Indeed,
the methodologies of both Drs. Angelides
and Kinsey considered by this
court started by acknowledging the unmet
need from COAH's First and Second
Rounds, and included those numbers in
the categories addressed in this proceeding.
If any amount of need is unmet during
the Third Round, it will be added to a
future Round and will not disappear, following
well-accepted COAH practice.

<P20>Dr. Powell criticized Dr. Kinsey's chart,
asserting in particular that the combined
30,000-unit credit for extensions of expiring
controls and vacant land and durational
adjustments was based on "soft" data.
While that may be true, it is clear that Dr.
Kinsey prepared his estimates with staff
from FSHC based upon their extensive
practical experience with the compliance
process. No one else who testified at the
trial, except perhaps Mr. Bernard, a former
Executive Director of COAH, had
anywhere near the experience with municipal
affordable housing compliance that Dr.
Kinsey had, which was augmented by his
working with the staff of the FSHC over
many years.

<P20>Moreover, Dr. Kinsey even accepted Dr.
Powell's "optimistic" projection for the
number of units to be created by inclusionary
projects rather than his "aggressive"
estimate and incorporated it into the chart.
While far from scientifically precise, the
chart is accepted by the court for what it
is&mdash;a series of educated guesses
<SPage 236>
based
on significant practical experience that
shows the Prospective Need obligations
recommended by Dr. Kinsey are not unreasonable
numbers totally divorced from
reality, as Plaintiffs contend, but rather
can likely be achieved through use of multiple
compliance mechanisms, including
new construction.

<P20>Indeed, that over 100 settlements had
been entered with FSHC as of May 2017
following the Supreme Court's returning
the substantive certification process to the
trial courts, including several settlements
in Mercer County municipalities that employ
many of the strategies included in the
Kinsey chart (<EMU>i.e.</EMU>, bonus credits, extensions
of expiring controls, inclusionary projects,
and 100 percent affordable projects),
demonstrates that the obligations calculated
by Dr. Kinsey are not as daunting to
many municipalities as Plaintiffs suggest.

<P20>In addition, while the chart purported to
demonstrate how a Prospective Need of
over 160,000 units could be met, this court
has calculated the Prospective Need to be
85,382. That lower number makes it even
more likely that it is achievable and accommodates
any overestimates that may have
been made by Dr. Kinsey, the uncertainty
of projections generally, and the contention
that some of the data used could be
considered as "soft."

<P20>Having provided an analysis of how his
Prospective Need number could be met
that included a projection that 48,865 new
affordable housing units were likely to be
constructed in the Third Round through
2025 somewhat constrained Dr. Kinsey
when his Gap Present Need obligation was
added to his Prospective Need figure. His
total including Gap Present Need soared
to 309,691 affordable units. Yet, despite
this number, which came close to doubling
his Prospective Need number, Dr. Kinsey
contended that the maximum new construction
<Page 609>
expected would remain at 48,865,
somewhat contradicting his own opinion
that the larger the obligation, the more
likely an increased number of new units
would be built. He nonetheless provided an
analysis to the court that purported to
demonstrate how his combined Prospective
Need and Gap Present Need obligation of
over 300,000 could be met. The
<SPage 237>
chart
illustrating his position was labelled "Impact
of Kinsey/FSHC Approach" and was
admitted into evidence as Ex. DF 96, at
slide 111:

<P00><IMAGE></IMAGE>

<P20>Notably, the categories with the biggest
changes were vacant land and durational
adjustments, which increased from 20,000
units being removed from the total to 45,000
units; units covered by court-approved
settlements going from 22,500 to 45,000
units removed from total need; applications
of twenty percent and 1,000-unit caps
removing 30,000 units whereas 6,000 had
been removed previously; and attributing
51,251 units to non-participating municipalities
while 26,000 had been removed from
these towns before. While Dr. Kinsey attempted
to justify these significant increases
in order to account for his claim
that the total obligation he recommended
to the court was both reasonable and
achievable, his explanations were unsatisfactory
and did not convince the court of
the reliability of the much-inflated assessment.
However, since the court's own analysis
of the methodologies presented in the
trial resulted in a combined post-twenty
percent cap Prospective Need and Gap
Present Need of 154,581, far below Dr.
Kinsey's number,
<SPage 238>
the court's rejection
of his final assessment as to how his total
recommended need could be achieved has
no impact on the outcome of this case and
does not alter the court's own conclusions.
Indeed, the court found Dr. Kinsey's analysis
demonstrating that his Prospective
Need number of 163,653 was achievable in
the Third Round to be credible. And that
analysis supports the reasonableness and
achievability of the total Third Round municipal
new construction obligation found
by the court in this proceeding.
<Page 610>

<CN>VIII. CONCLUSION

<P20>As the preceding discussion demonstrates,
the parties, expert witnesses, and
Special Master Reading put an enormous
effort into analyzing the most appropriate
methodology by which to calculate municipal
affordable housing obligations in the
Third Round affordable housing cycle. The
enormity of the effort reflects the critical
importance of the task to the citizens and
political subdivisions in the State of New
Jersey. The court hopes that the formulas
adopted and explained in this decision enable
Princeton and West Windsor to
promptly finalize new Housing Elements
and Fair Share Plans that satisfy their
constitutional obligations to provide housing
affordable to our State's LMI households.
And the court hopes as well that the
work of all involved, and the transparency
of the judicial process leading to the adoption
of the court's methodology, will assist
other courts grappling with similar issues
and&mdash;eventually&mdash;will assist a reconstituted
COAH in ensuring continuing compliance
with the <EMU>Mount Laurel</EMU> doctrine.

<P20>OPINION BY <author>DUBOW</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>In these consolidated appeals, Appellant,
Tamoya Payne, appeals from the September
14, 2023 judgments of sentence entered
in the Allegheny County Court of
Common Pleas following her convictions
of, <EM>inter alia,</EM> Receiving Stolen Property
("RSP") and Access Device Fraud
("ADF"). Appellant challenges the sufficiency
of the evidence in support of her
convictions of these offenses. After careful
review, we affirm.

<P20>The relevant facts and procedural history
are as follows. In October 2022, after
the Homestead Police Department contacted
Detective Jackie Weibel, a certified
fraud examiner working for Allegheny
County District Attorney's Office, Detective
Weibel began investigating the discovery
by employees of Paramount Services
("Paramount") and Steel City Dental
("Steel City") of counterfeit and altered
checks. With respect to Paramount, Melissa
Smith ("Smith"), the Chief Financial
Officer at Paramount, received a phone
call from a bank asking her about a suspicious
check for $9,927.41 payable to Appellant.
Smith confirmed that she had written
the amount designated on the check, but
denied having made Appellant the payee.
Appellant was not an employee or vendor
of Paramount and Paramount did not owe
Appellant any money.

<P20>Around the same time, Heather Cigrand,
an administrator in charge of payroll
at Steel City, informed police and Steel
City's bank that she had discovered a fake
check for $3,982.40 made payable to Appellant.
Steel City did not employ Appellant,
did not owe any money to Appellant, and,
therefore had no reason to make a check
payable to her.

<P20>After obtaining search warrants, Detective
Weibel located records documenting
all the transactions associated with Appellant's
PNC Bank account from September
14, 2022, through October 19, 2022.
Through her investigation, Detective Weibel
learned Appellant had deposited the
Paramount and Steel City checks into Appellant's
PNC Bank account. Detective
Weibel's investigation revealed that Appellant
<Page 623>
was the only person with access to the
PNC account. Further investigation revealed
that Appellant had transferred
money from her PNC account to a Cash
App account in her name.

<P20>Specifically, Detective Weibel discovered
that, on October 6, 2022, Appellant deposited
a check from Steel City for $3,982.40
with the PNC Bank teller. Following this
deposit, Appellant's PNC Bank records
showed a $15 transfer to Apple Cash and a
$5 transfer to Cash App.

<P20>On October 11, 2022, video surveillance
footage from PNC Bank depicted a woman
who looked like Appellant, but whose face
the video did not clearly show, depositing a
check. That same day, Appellant's bank
records showed that the Paramount check
had been deposited into Appellant's account.
Following the deposit, there were
several transfers of funds to Appellant's
Cash App account for a total of $6,955.50, a
Zelle transfer to an individual named
George Duckett, and a $506 cash withdrawal
from an ATM at River's Casino.

<P20>PNC Bank returned both checks as
fraudulent and closed Appellant's account.
At the time PNC Bank closed the account,
the account showed an overdrawn balance
of $9,879.47.

<P20>As a result of Detective Weibel's investigation,
on March 29, 2023, the Commonwealth
charged Appellant at Docket No.
202301452 with one count each of Theft by
Deception, RSP, Forgery, ADF, and Passing
Bad Checks<fnr1> related to the Paramount
check. On May 3, 2023, the Commonwealth
charged Appellant at Docket No.
202302389 with the same five offenses related
to the Steel City check. The court
consolidated the cases for trial.

<P20>On September 14, 2023, following a
bench trial, the court convicted Appellant
at each docket number of one count each
of Theft, RSP and ADF. On September 18,
2023, the trial court sentenced Appellant to
four years of probation. Appellant filed a
post-sentence motion, which the trial court
denied.

<P20>This timely appeal followed. Both Appellant
and the trial court complied with Pa.
A.R.P. 1925.

<P20>Appellant raises the following four issues
on appeal:

<B24>I. Whether [Appellant's] conviction
for [RSP] at [Docket No.]
202301452 can be sustained where
the Commonwealth failed to
prove, beyond a reasonable doubt,
that [Appellant] possessed the
requisite <EM>mens rea</EM> as required by
the statute?

<B24>II. Whether [Appellant's] conviction
for [RSP] at [Docket No.]
202302389 can be sustained where
the Commonwealth failed to prove,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that
[Appellant] possessed the requisite
<EM>mens rea</EM> as required by the statute?

<B24>III. Whether [Appellant's] conviction
for [ADF] can be sustained where
the Commonwealth, failed to
prove, beyond a reasonable doubt,
that [Appellant] used an "access
device" that was counterfeited, altered,
revoked, or belonged to
someone else?

<B24>IV. Whether [Appellant's] conviction
for [ADF] at [Docket No.]
202302389 can be sustained where
the Commonwealth failed to prove,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that
<Page 624>
[Appellant] used an "access device"
that was counterfeited, altered,
revoked, or belonged to
someone else?

<P00>Appellant's Brief at 7.

<CN><EMB>A.</EMB>

<P20>Appellant challenges the sufficiency
of the evidence in support of her
RSP and ADF convictions. In addressing
this challenge, our well-settled standard of
review is <EM>de novo,</EM> and our scope of review
is limited to the evidence admitted at trial
viewed in the light most favorable to the
Commonwealth as verdict winner. <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Rushing,</EMBI> 627 Pa. 59, 99
A.3d 416, 420-21 (2014). We determine
"whether the evidence at trial, and all reasonable
inferences derived therefrom,
when viewed in the light most favorable to
the Commonwealth as verdict winner, are
sufficient to establish all elements of the
offense beyond a reasonable doubt." <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. May,</EMBI> 584 Pa. 640, 887 A.2d
750, 753 (2005). The factfinder, "while
passing on the credibility of the witnesses
and the weight of the evidence&mdash;is free to
believe all, part, or none of the evidence."

<CN><EMB>B.</EMB>

<HN20><EMB>Receiving Stolen Property</EMB>

<P20>In her first two issues, Appellant
asserts that the Commonwealth failed to
present sufficient evidence to support her
convictions of RSP. In particular, Appellant
claims that the Commonwealth did not
prove that Appellant knew or had reason
to know that the funds deposited into her
PNC Bank account had been stolen. Appellant's
Brief at 18-23, 25-26. She argues
that because the fraudulent checks at issue
bore her name, appeared to be legitimate,
and the Commonwealth presented no evidence
suggesting that Appellant was involved
in the creation or procurement of
the bad checks or that she had deposited
the checks, it was unreasonable for the
court to infer that Appellant knew the
funds were stolen. Appellant's Brief at 23,
25.

<P20>The Crimes Code provides that "[a] person
is guilty of [receiving stolen property]
if he intentionally receives, retains, or disposes
of movable property of another
knowing that it has been stolen, or believing
that it has probably been stolen, unless
the property is received, retained, or disposed
with intent to restore it to the owner."
18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3925(a).

<P20>The Commonwealth may prove
that the defendant knew or had reason to
believe the property was stolen through
direct or circumstantial evidence. <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Robinson,</EMBI> 128 A.3d 261, 265
(Pa. Super. 2015) (<EM>en banc</EM>). A fact-finder
may infer knowledge or belief that property
was stolen from facts such as the recency
of the theft, the place or manner of
possession, alternations to the property indicative
of theft, or a false explanation for
the possession. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 268-69. <EMBI>See also
Commonwealth v. Riley,</EMBI> 302 A.3d 112,
116 (Pa. Super. 2023), <EM>appeal granted,</EM> 2024
WL 4272542 (Pa. Sept. 24, 2024) ("Once
the Commonwealth proves the recency of
the thefts, the jury is free to infer that the
defendant was the thief unless the defendant
can offer a satisfactory alternative
explanation for his possession of the stolen
goods."). The fact-finder may also consider
a defendant's conduct while in possession
of the stolen goods when determining
guilty knowledge. <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Williams,</EMBI> 468 Pa. 357, 362 A.2d 244, 248-49
(1976).

<P20>Any "unexplained" possession of
stolen property is a question of fact, and
the trier of fact should consider the circumstances
of possession when the defendant
<Page 625>
offers no explanation for his or her
possession. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 249. The trier of fact can
also consider whether the defendant and
the property's rightful owner are known to
each other, as well as any lack of permission,
and the defendant's conduct while in
possession of the stolen property. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
248-50.

<P20>Our review of the record indicates that
the Commonwealth presented sufficient
evidence to support Appellant's RSP convictions.
First, representatives of both Paramount
and Steel City testified that they
did not know or employ Appellant, nor did
they owe her money. N.T. Trial, 9/14/23, at
14, 21. Thus, there was no reason that
either of them would have written a check
payable to Appellant and no reason for
Appellant to believe that she had the right
to deposit funds from either company into
her account.

<P20>The evidence also demonstrated that the
checks were deposited into Appellant's
PNC Bank account shortly after their issuance
and the funds were withdrawn or
transferred contemporaneous with the deposit
into the account. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 32-34. The
Commonwealth also presented evidence
that the checks were deposited into an
account owned solely by Appellant, withdrawn
at an ATM from the account owned
by her, and the funds were transferred to
an app in her name and controlled by her.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 29-32, 34, 38. Additionally, the Commonwealth
demonstrated that Appellant's
debit card and PIN number were used to
remove cash from an ATM at River's Casino.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 32, 34. The record contains no
evidence that Appellant reported that the
card and PIN had been stolen or that she
had given them to anyone else, nor did she
report any unusual activity on her PNC
Bank account to the bank or the police.
Rather, her actions lead to the reasonable
conclusion that she knew the funds, which
she did not earn or have any legal claim to,
were in her bank account and she began to
immediately withdraw the money. Thus,
we conclude that, when viewed in the light
most favorable to the Commonwealth as
verdict winner, the evidence supports the
trial court's inference that Appellant knew
the checks were stolen. Accordingly, Appellant
is not entitled to relief on this
claim.

<HN20><EMB>Access Device Fraud</EMB>

<P20>In her final two issues, Appellant
asserts that the Commonwealth failed to
adduce sufficient evidence to support her
convictions of ADF. Appellant's Brief at
27-32. Appellant acknowledges that "no
bank would ever authorize the withdrawal
of funds through a fraudulent check." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
at 28. Nevertheless, she argues that, because
the "access device" in question was
her own valid ATM card, she was authorized
to use it to withdraw funds from her
own account. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 29-32. Therefore, she
concludes that the Commonwealth failed to
prove that she used an "access device" that
was counterfeited, altered, revoked, or belonged
to someone else. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>The Crimes Code provides, in relevant
part, that a person commits ADF if she
"uses an access device to obtain or in an
attempt to obtain property or services with
knowledge that ... [her] use of the access
device is unauthorized by the issuer or the
device holder[.]" 18 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 4106(a)(1)(iv).<fnr2>
<Page 626>

<P20>Contrary to Appellant's argument,
Section 4106(a)(1)(iv) does not require the
Commonwealth to prove that Appellant
used a counterfeit, altered, or revoked access
device to obtain property. Rather, as
set forth above, Section 4106(a)(1)(iv) requires
that the Commonwealth prove that
the user of the access device used it in a
way that was not authorized by its issuer,
<EM>i.e.,</EM> to obtain funds which did not rightfully
belong to her.

<P20>Viewed in the light most favorable to the
Commonwealth as verdict-winner, the evidence
of record, as described above, indicates
that the funds deposited into and
withdrawn from Appellant's PNC Bank account
by Appellant were stolen. <EMBI>See generally,</EMBI>
N.T. Trial at 11-36. From this evidence,
we conclude that it was reasonable
for the trial court to infer that PNC Bank
did not authorize Appellant to use her
ATM card to deposit or withdraw funds to
which she had no legal right. Yet, Appellant
did use her debit card to deposit and
withdraw funds that did not legally belong
to her. Accordingly, Appellant's claim that
the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient
evidence to prove that Appellant
used an access device in an unauthorized
manner fails.

<P20>Judgment of sentence affirmed.

<fnt2> An "access device" is "[a]ny card, including,

card and automated teller machine card,
plate, code, account number, personal identification
number or other means of account
access that can be used alone or in conjunction
with another access device to obtain

<P20>OPINION BY <author>MURRAY</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Grant Mackay Company, Inc. (Grant
Mackay), Charah Solutions (Charah), and
Controlled Demolition, Inc. (CDI) (collectively,
Appellants), appeal from the order
entering a preliminary injunction against
Appellants, and in favor of the plaintiffs,
Thomas and Stacey Ansell, Travis and
Brittni Bair, Brittni Cadamore n/k/a Brittni
Bair, Daniel Carrigan, Thomas and Patricia
Carrigan, Kevin Keener and Suzanne
Price, Joe and Caitlin Kern, Shawn
Moore and Rose Paris, Linda Schaffer,
Donald J. Vasil, Jr., and Victoria Christy
(collectively, Plaintiffs).<fnr1> The trial court's
order preliminarily enjoined implosion of a
boiler house at the former Cheswick Generating
Station (Power Plant). After careful
review, we reverse the order entering a
preliminary injunction against Appellants.

<P20>The trial court issued the following findings
of fact:

<B22>The [] Power Plant was formerly a 565
MW coal-fired power station located in
Springdale, Pennsylvania, and apparently,
the only one in Allegheny County.
(Compl. &para; 15). On June 2, 2023, [Grant
Mackay], the general contractor, and
[CDI], the demolition subcontractor, imploded
two (2) chimney stacks located at
the [Power Plant], which is now owned
by Charah [].<fnr2> (Compl. &para; 28). CDI was
responsible for obtaining a Blasting Activity
Permit from the Pennsylvania ...
Environmental Protection Agency (the
"DEP"), designing and felling the chimneys,
handling explosives, transporting
explosives to the site, and felling the
<Page 630>
chimneys in the specified area. (H.T.
Vol. VII at 20<fnr3>).

<B22>Mark Loizeaux ("Mr. Loizeaux"), President
of CDI, admitted that on June 2,
2023, the chimneys were imploded and
although one (1) chimney fell as designed
to fall, [implosion of] the 750' (the
second) chimney created an air blast
that damaged a tree, which fell into a
power line, and projected dust and debris
outside of the project site and into
the surrounding residential neighborhood.
(H.T. Vol. VII at 30). CDI recorded
the seismic activity during the chimney
stacks implosion and provided the
recorded ground vibration and air overpressure
readings to the DEP. (H.T.
Vol. VII at 35-36).

<B22>Mr. Loizeaux admitted that when the
chimneys were imploded, they were expected
to break apart forty percent
(40%) of the way up, which creates an
opening to vent air pressure, and the
750' chimney did not break apart; consequently,
the air pressure was forced out
the end of the chimney. (H.T. Vol. VII at
50-51)....

<B22>....

<B22>The June 2, 2023[,] demolition of the
chimney stacks released dust, insulation,
flyrock, and debris into the air, resulting
in the formation of a cloud of dust, which
included toxic ... metals. (Compl. &para; 29).

<P00>Trial Court Findings and Conclusions,
1/25/24, at 3-4 (footnotes added; paragraph
designations omitted; formatting modified).

<P20>Following the chimney stacks' implosion,
the DEP cited CDI for exceeding "permitted
air blast limits," thereby causing flyrock
and damage to private property and
overhead utility lines. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 4. As found by
the trial court,

<B22>[t]his fugitive dust cloud traveled out-ward
from the Power Plant property,
into the homes and onto yards of the
Plaintiffs and other residents surrounding
the Power Plant in the Springdale
Borough community. (Pl. Ex. 88, 89)[.]
... It is undisputed that fugitive dust
from the chimney implosions traversed
the property of the Power Plant into the
homes and onto the property of the
Plaintiffs and other surrounding residents.
(Pl. Ex. 88, 89). The Plaintiffs'
expert, S. Thomas Dydek, Ph.D. ("Dr.
Dydek"), testified that even after the
dust visibly settled onto the ground
and/or surfaces, invisible dust remained
in the area further increasing the risk of
harm. (H.T. Vol. IX at 201).

<B22>....

<B22>Following the implosion, clean-up methods
[employed] may not have alleviated
the risk. Individuals used leaf blowers
and power washers to remove dust from
the surfaces on which it was visible.
(H.T. Vol. VII at 139-140). Dr. Dydek
testified that these methods re-distributed
the dust throughout the community,
and that the clean[-]up methods did not
remove all the dust; the fact that dust
may not have been visible in the days
after the implosion did not necessarily
eliminate the risk of harm from that
dust. (H.T. Vol. IX at 201-206).

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 5 (paragraph designations omitted;
formatting modified). The trial court found
that dust samples collected by Plaintiffs,
from furniture inside their homes, had
"RCRA metals," such as lead and arsenic.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 6. In addition, "[m]ultiple individuals
had eye injuries [and respiratory issues]
occur ... not only shortly after the implosion
but continued thereafter...." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at

<P20>Relevant to the instant proceedings, on
August 30, 2023, CDI applied to the DEP
for a blasting permit to implode the Power
Plant's boiler house.

<B22><EMB>On September 15, 2023, CDI was
granted a second blasting permit by
the DEP,</EMB> and the implosion of the boiler
house was set for one (1) week later, on
September 22, 2023. (Def. Ex. 3). Prior
to receiving the blasting permit, [Appellants]
weakened and partially loaded
with explosives the boiler house structure,
and these actions limited the available
remedies by the parties and [the
trial court]. (H.T. Vol. VII at 76-77).

Trial Court Findings and Conclusions,
1/25/20, &para; 28 (stating that after issuance of
the blasting permit, Plaintiffs filed the instant
injunctive action).

<P20>On September 15, 2023, Plaintiffs filed,
in the common pleas court, a complaint in
equity for injunctive relief (Complaint).<fnr4>
Plaintiffs sought to enjoin implosion of the
boiler house and to restrain a public nuisance
caused by the implosion. <EMBI>See generally</EMBI>
Complaint, 9/15/23. On September 18,
2023, the trial court entered an order directing
the parties to maintain the status
quo, and scheduling a "hearing on [] Plaintiffs'
Emergency Motion for Preliminary
Injunction" for September 20, 2023.<fnr5> Order,
9/18/23, at 1. The trial court conducted
this hearing, over multiple days, from September
20, 2023, through November 15,
2023.

<P20>Relevantly, in their second amended
complaint, Plaintiffs averred the DEP improperly
issued a blasting permit because
(a) blasting efforts at the Power Plant will
cause substantial harm to Plaintiffs, <EMBI>see</EMBI>
Second Amended Complaint, 10/18/23, &para; 1;
and (b) the blasting permit was issued in
violation of the Sunshine Act, 65 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 701 <EM>et seq.</EM> <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> &para; 2. In their second
amended complaint, Appellants claimed
that Springdale Borough issued a building
permit authorizing the demolition without
a hearing, and without a determination of
the proper fee by the Borough Council. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
&para; 14. Plaintiffs asserted that the Borough's
failure to comply with a statute requiring
an open hearing constitutes irreparable
harm. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> &para; 4.

<P20>On December 10, 2023, trial court entered
an order granting Plaintiffs' emergency
motion for a preliminary injunction
and enjoining demolition of the Power
Plant's boiler house. Trial Court Order,
12/10/23. The trial court's order directed,
<EM>inter alia,</EM> the following:

<B22>1. [The trial court] find[s] that the Plaintiffs
have met the six (6) elements required
to issue a preliminary injunction
as a matter of law.

<B22>2. The Parties are to meet and discuss a
joint comprehensive safety plan for the
implosion of the boiler house and attempt
to reach an agreement within ten
(10) days of this Order.

<B22>3. The joint comprehensive safety plan
shall be submitted to the DEP and the
[Allegheny County Health Department
(ACHD)] for review and input, and the
Parties shall request both the DEP and
the ACHD to attend and participate in a
public meeting.
<Page 632>

<B22>4. The Plaintiffs shall request that the
DEP condition the approval of the blasting
permit on meeting all [] terms of the
joint comprehensive safety plan, plus
any and all terms that the Plaintiffs
believe necessary to safely implode the
boiler house.

<B22>5. The public meeting shall be held to
provide the Plaintiffs and the residents
with notice and the opportunity to be
heard regarding the comprehensive
safety plan.

<B22>6. Pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1531, upon submission
of the joint comprehensive safety
plan, plus any and all terms that the
Plaintiffs believe necessary to implode
the boiler house, and after the public
meeting is held, the Parties shall Praecipe
for a conciliation/hearing for [the
trial court] to consider dissolution of the
injunction.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 1-2. Appellants respectively filed
timely appeals of the trial court's order.
Appellants and the trial court have complied
with Pa.R.A.P. 1925.

<P20>Appellant Charah presents the following
issues for our review:

<B22>1. Did the trial court lack jurisdiction
over the preliminary injunction because
[Plaintiffs] did not exhaust their administrative
remedies, while collaterally attacking
final actions by the [DEP] and
the [ACHD]?

<B22>2. Did the trial court err as a matter of
law and on the record by usurping the
statutory and regulatory authority
granted to the DEP and ACHD?

<B22>3. Did the trial court err as a matter of
law by granting relief that exceeds the
permissible scope and violates due process?

<B22>4. Did the trial court err as a matter of
law and on the record by granting the
preliminary injunction while denying
[Plaintiffs] relief on the merits?

<B22>5. Did the trial court err as a matter of
law and on the record by misapplying
the irreparable harm standard?

<B22>6. Did the trial court err on the record
by holding that the [Plaintiffs] established
irreparable harm?

<B22>7. Did the trial court err as a matter of
law and on the record by relying on
inadmissible evidence to conclude that
asbestos "may still be present at the
Power Plant"?

<B22>8. Did the trial court err as a matter of
law and abuse its discretion by setting
an insufficient preliminary injunction
bond [of] $50,000?

<P00>Appellant Charah's Brief at 1 (some capitalization
modified).

<P20>Appellant Grant Mackay, joined by CDI,
presents the following issues:

<B22>A. Whether the trial court erred in violating
the agency autonomy of and collaterally
attacking the regulatory agency
autonomy of both the [DEP] and the
[ACHD]?

<B22>B. Whether the trial court abused its
discretion and misapplied the applicable
legal standard by issuing a preliminary
injunction that lacked any apparently
reasonable grounds to satisfy the requirements
set forth in <EMBI>Warehime v.
Warehime</EMBI> [580 Pa. 201], 860 A.2d 41
(Pa. 2004)?

<B22>C. Whether the trial court erred in exceeding
the relief requested by the
Plaintiffs?

<B22>D. Whether the order of court entered
by the trial court is unenforceable in
that it is not reasonably clear, unambiguous,
or sufficiently certain, and that the
trial court essentially directed the parties
to resolve the case by entertaining
any and all conditions requested by the
Plaintiffs and their experts, presenting
the conditions to the [DEP] and the
[ACHD] for conditional approval, holding
<Page 633>
a public meeting, and then returning
to the [trial c]ourt for conciliation/hearing?

<B22>E. Whether any of the findings of fact
on which the trial court relied lacked
any apparently reasonable grounds[?]

<P00>Appellant Grant Mackay's Brief (joined by
CDI) at 3-5 (issues reordered; some capitalization
modified).

<P20>All Appellants challenge the jurisdiction
of the trial court to preliminarily
enjoin blasting activity at the Power Plant.
Appellant Charah's Brief at 15; Appellant
Grant Mackay's Brief at 19. The question
of subject matter jurisdiction is one which
may be raised at any time and one over
which we exercise <EM>de novo</EM> and plenary
review. <EMBI>In re Admin. Ord. No. 1-MD-2003,</EMBI>
594 Pa. 346, 936 A.2d 1, 5 (2007).

<P20>Charah claims Plaintiffs "based their request
for a preliminary injunction largely
on attacks against allowing the DEP's and
ACHD's permitting and clearance processes."
Appellant Charah's Brief at 15. Charah
argues that, "[b]y failing to exhaust
administrative remedies available to them,
[Plaintiffs] deprived any court of jurisdiction
over their demand for a preliminary
injunction." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Charah claims Plaintiffs
are collaterally attacking the permitting
and clearance processes of administrative
agencies. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 16.

<P20>Charah points out the trial court ordered
Plaintiffs to exhaust their administrative
remedies, by submitting a comprehensive
plan to DEP and ACHD for
review. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 17. Appellants argue,

<B22>[i]f [Appellants] wished to challenge the
issuance of the blasting permit for the
boiler house, they were required to do
so before the [Environmental Hearing
Board (EHB)] ... (35 [P.S.] &sect; 7511 <EM>et
seq.</EM> (1989)), which "has the power and
duty to hold hearings and issue adjudications
... on orders, permits, licenses
or decisions of the" DEP. 35 [P.S.]
&sect; 7514(a). Plaintiffs were aware of the
issuance of the blasting permit on September
15, 2023 (one[] week before the
scheduled implosion), ... and the administrative
remedies available to them
before the EHB based on the appeal
paragraph included in the blasting permit
itself.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 18 (some punctuation modified).

<P20>Grant Mackay similarly argues "the
Pennsylvania Legislature has statutorily
conferred upon the DEP the responsibility
and authority to regulate blasting in this
Commonwealth through the Administrative
Code of 1929, 71 P.S. &sect; 510-17." Appellant
Grant Mackay's Brief at 19. Grant
Mackay points out there is no dispute that
DEP issued a Blasting Activity Permit. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
at 20. According to Grant Mackay, representatives
from DEP testified at the hearing
that the permit was properly issued in
accordance with the Administrative Code.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Grant Mackay argues that there is an
adequate administrative remedy available
to Plaintiffs. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Grant Mackay points out
that the blasting permit, itself, provided
that

<B22>[a]ny person aggrieved by this action
may appeal the action to the [EHB],
pursuant to Section 4 of the [EHB] Act,
35 P.S. &sect; 7514, and the Administrative
Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S.[A.] Chapter 5A.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 20-21. According to Grant Mackay,
the EHB is empowered to issue a supersedeas
based upon consideration of whether
irreparable harm or likely injury to the
public may result. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 21 (citing 35 P.S.
&sect; 7514(d)(1)).

<P20>Plaintiffs counter that administrative
remedies would not have protected against
the potential harm alleged. Plaintiffs' Brief
(Charah) at 36. Plaintiffs contend that
"[a]nything to do with dust or air quality
fell outside" of the jurisdiction of the DEP.
<Page 634>
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Plaintiffs acknowledge testimony that
ACHD has "purview over air quality [in
Allegheny County], and ACHD would issue
a letter indicating that it approved the
dust mitigation control plan submitted by
[Grant Mackay]." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> However, Plaintiffs
argue the witness from ACHD was unaware
of what information is considered by
ACHD in approving a dust plan. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Plaintiffs
further argue that ACHD does not
analyze the dust being released from a
demolition, as the ACHD focuses solely on
asbestos. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 37. Plaintiffs thus argue
that challenging either the blasting permit
or ACHD's asbestos clearance documentation
would serve no purpose. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Plaintiffs also assert that the administrative
process does not supplant injunctive
relief. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 38. They claim that even
where a permit is issued, a party may still
file for injunctive relief should the use of
that permit cause a nuisance (or other
damage). <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (citing <EMBI>Machipongo Land &
Coal Co. Inc. v. DEP,</EMBI> 569 Pa. 3, 799 A.2d
751 (2002) (<EMBI>Machipongo</EMBI>)). Plaintiffs' Brief
(Charah) at 39. Plaintiffs argue they "did
not seek to challenge the permits, [and]
were not required to do so[.]" <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 40.

<P20>Initially, we must address whether
the trial court had jurisdiction to issue a
preliminary injunction.

<B22>"It is fundamental that prior to resorting
to judicial remedies, litigants must
exhaust all the adequate and available
administrative remedies which the legislature
has provided." <EMBI>Cnty. of Berks ex
rel. Baldwin v. Pa. Labor Rels. Bd.,</EMBI>
544 Pa. 541, 678 A.2d 355, 360 (1996);
<EMBI>see also Dep't of Pub. Welfare v. Eisenberg
(Eisenberg I),</EMBI> 499 Pa. 530, 454
A.2d 513, 514-15 (1982) ("Where injunctive
relief is sought, our initial focus
should be on the threshold question regarding
whether equity jurisdiction is
appropriate. That equity will not intervene
where there is available an adequate
statutorily prescribed remedy at
law[] is a principle well established in
this Commonwealth."). The exhaustion

<B44>doctrine is a court-made rule intended
to prevent premature judicial intervention
into the administrative process.
A court is [t]o defer judicial review
where the question presented is
one within an agency specialization
and where the administrative remedy
is likely to produce the desired result.
The doctrine operates as a restraint
on the exercise of a court's equitable
powers and a recognition of the legislature's
direction to comply with statutorily-prescribed
remedies.

<B22><EMBI>Empire Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v.
Dep't of Env't Res.,</EMBI> 546 Pa. 315, 684
A.2d 1047, 1053 (1996) (alteration in
original) (citations and internal quotation
marks omitted). Nonetheless, the exhaustion
doctrine is not absolute. <EMBI>Feingold
v. Bell of Pa.,</EMBI> 477 Pa. 1, 383 A.2d
791, 793 (1977).

<P00><EMBI>Glenn O. Hawbaker, Inc. v. Commonwealth
DOT,</EMBI> ___ Pa. ___, 304 A.3d 1067,
1081 (2023). The purposes of this exhaustion
requirement are to prevent premature
judicial intervention in the administrative
process; and to ensure that claims will be
addressed by the body with expertise in
the area. <EMBI>Lehman v. Pennsylvania State
Police,</EMBI> 576 Pa. 365, 839 A.2d 265, 275
(2003); <EMBI>Empire Sanitary Landfill,</EMBI> 684
A.2d at 1053.

<P20>There are three exceptions to
the exhaustion doctrine:

<B22>The first exception is where the jurisdiction
of an agency is challenged. The
second exception is where the constitutionality
of a statutory scheme or its
validity is challenged. The third exception
is where the legal or equitable remedies
are unavailable or inadequate, or
the administrative agency is unable to
provide the requested relief. Under the
<Page 635>
third exception, even though an administrative
agency may not have jurisdiction
over all constitutional issues raised by a
litigant, the litigant must first exhaust
its administrative remedies where there
is no separate allegation that the available
statutory remedy is inadequate.

<P00><EMBI>Empire Sanitary Landfill,</EMBI> 684 A.2d at
1054 (citations omitted).

<P20>An administrative "remedy is
inadequate if it either (1) does not allow
for adjudication of the issue raised ... [,]
or (2) allows irreparable harm to occur to
the plaintiffs during the pursuit of the
statutory remedy." <EMBI>Commonwealth ex rel.
Nicholas v. Pa. Labor Rels. Bd.,</EMBI> 545 Pa.
288, 681 A.2d 157, 161 (1996).

<B22>It is true an administrative remedy is
considered inadequate if the plaintiff
makes a clear showing that it would
suffer irreparable injury during pursuit
of that remedy. <EMB>However, where an administrative
process exists to resolve a
dispute, ... a court of equity is not
justified in exercising jurisdiction
solely on the basis that it may reach a
more expeditious resolution.</EMB>

(citations omitted; emphasis added).

<P20>We observe that by statute, the
DEP is vested with authority to abate
nuisances in Pennsylvania. 71 P.S. &sect; 510-17.
Specifically, the DEP has the power
and duty

<B22><EMB>(1)</EMB> To protect the people of this Commonwealth
from unsanitary conditions
and other nuisances, including any condition
which is declared to be a nuisance
by any law administered by the department;

<B22><EMB>(2)</EMB> To cause examination to be made of
nuisances, or questions affecting the security
of life and health, in any locality,
and, for that purpose, without fee or
hinderance, to enter, examine and survey
all grounds, vehicles, apartments,
buildings, and places, within the Commonwealth,
and all persons, authorized
by the department to enter, examine
and survey such grounds, vehicles,
apartments, buildings and places, shall
have the powers and authority conferred
by law upon constables;

<B22><EMB>(3)</EMB> To order such nuisances including
those detrimental to the public health to
be abated and removed;

<B22><EMB>(4)</EMB> If the owner or occupant of any
premises, whereon any such nuisance
fails to comply with any order of the
department for the abatement or removal
thereof, to enter upon the premises,
to which such order relates, and abate
or remove such nuisance;

<B22><EMB>(5)</EMB> For the purpose of collecting or recovering
the expense of the abatement
or removal of a nuisance, to file a claim,
or maintain an action, in such manner as
may now or hereafter be provided by
law, against the owner or occupant of
the premises upon or from which such
nuisance shall have been abated or removed
by the department;

<B22><EMB>(6)</EMB> In making examinations as authorized
by this section, the [DEP] shall
cooperate with the Department of
Health, for the purpose of avoiding any
duplication of inspection or overlapping
of functions.

<P00>71 P.S. &sect; 510-17.

<P20>The DEP is statutorily vested with authority
over blasting activities in Pennsylvania:

<B22>DEP did not always have enforcement
authority for Blasting Act violations; in
fact, when the Blasting Act became law
on July 10, 1957, the Department of
Labor and Industry [] was charged with
administering it. Then, in 1981, the General
Assembly shifted this authority to
<Page 636>
the Department of Environmental Resources,
which has since been re-named
DEP.

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Marks Contr., Ltd.,</EMBI>
850 A.2d 873, 875 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2004) (footnotes
omitted).

<P20>The Blasting Act has not been amended
since the 1981 transfer of powers and
duties. It contains only five sections: a
definition section, 73 P.S. &sect; 164; a section
dealing with examination and licensing of
blasters, <EMBI>see id.</EMBI> &sect; 165; a provision requiring
that blasting operations be conducted
in accordance with regulations, <EMBI>see id.</EMBI>
&sect; 166; a provision authorizing DEP to promulgate
rules and regulations to effectuate
the Act, <EMBI>see id.</EMBI> &sect; 167; and a penalties
section, <EMBI>see id.</EMBI> &sect; 168.

<P20>Relevantly, Section 166 (Blasting operations
conducted in accordance with regulations)
provides as follows:

<B22><EMB>(a) The use of explosives for the purpose
of blasting</EMB> in the neighborhood of
any public highway, stream of water,
<EMB>dwelling house,</EMB> public building, school,
church, commercial or institutional
building, or pipe line, <EMB>shall be done in
accordance with the provisions of this
section, and rules and regulations promulgated
by the [DEP].</EMB>

<P00>73 P.S. &sect; 166(a) (emphasis added). The
Pennsylvania Code provides that, "a person
may not engage in blasting activities in
this Commonwealth <EMB>without first obtaining
the appropriate permit</EMB> from [DEP]
issued under this chapter." 25 Pa. Code
&sect; 211.121(a) (emphasis added).

<P20>"The EHB has the jurisdiction to
hear appeals of actions of the [DEP.]"
<EMBI>Empire Sanitary Landfill,</EMBI> 684 A.2d at
1053 (citing 35 P.S. &sect; 7514(2)). Section 7514
defines the powers and duties of the EHB:

<B22><EMB>(a) GENERAL RULE.</EMB>&mdash; The [EHB]
has the power and duty to hold hearings
and issue adjudications under 2 Pa.
C.S.[A.] Ch. 5 Subch. A (relating to
practice and procedure of Commonwealth
agencies) on orders, permits, licenses
or decisions of [DEP].

<B22><EMB>(b) POWERS CONTINUED.</EMB>&mdash; The
[EHB] shall continue to exercise the
powers to hold hearings and issue adjudications
which (powers) were vested in
agencies listed in section 1901-A of the
act of April 9, 1929 (P.L. 177, No. 175),
known as The Administrative Code of
1929.

<B22><EMB>(c) DEPARTMENTAL ACTION.</EMB>&mdash;
The [DEP] may take an action initially
without regard to 2 Pa.C.S.[A.] Ch. 5
Subch. A, but no action of the [DEP]
adversely affecting a person shall be
final as to that person until the person
has had the opportunity to appeal the
action to the [EHB] under subsection
(g). If a person has not perfected an
appeal in accordance with the regulations
of the board, the [DEP's] action
shall be final as to the person.

<B22><EMB>(d) SUPERSEDEAS.</EMB>&mdash;

<B44><EMB>(1)</EMB> No appeal shall act as an automatic
supersedeas. <EMB>The [EHB] may,
however, grant a supersedeas upon
cause shown.</EMB> The [EHB], in granting
or denying a supersedeas, shall be
guided by relevant judicial precedent
and the board's own precedent.
Among the factors to be considered
are:

<B66><EMB>(i) Irreparable harm to the petitioner.</EMB>

<B66>(ii) The likelihood of the petitioner
prevailing on the merits.

<B66><EMB>(iii) The likelihood of injury to
the public or other parties, such
as the permittee in third party
appeals.</EMB>

<B44><EMB>(2)</EMB> A supersedeas shall not be issued
in cases where pollution or injury to
the public health, safety or welfare
exists or is threatened during the period
<Page 637>
when the supersedeas would be
in effect.

<B44><EMB>(3)</EMB> The board shall promulgate regulations
for issuance or denial of a temporary
supersedeas.

<B22><EMB>(e) INTERVENTION.&mdash; Any interested
party may intervene in any matter
pending before the [EHB].</EMB>

<B22>....

<B22><EMB>(h) VOLUNTARY MEDIATION.</EMB>&mdash;
Subject to [EHB] approval, parties to
any proceeding may request permission
to utilize voluntary mediation services to
resolve the dispute or narrow the areas
of difference. If the [EHB] approves, the
hearing shall be continued until the parties
report the results of the mediation.
If the parties accept the mediation report
and the result is consistent with
State and Federal environmental laws,
then the [EHB] may enter the settlement
as its decision. If mediation is unsuccessful,
then the hearing shall be rescheduled
and conducted in accordance
with the provisions of law.

<P00>35 P.S. &sect; 7514(a)-(e), (h) (emphasis added).

<P20>Plaintiffs further could have appealed
any determination by the DEP directly to
the Commonwealth Court:

<B22>As concerns a right of appeal from agency
adjudications, the Administrative
Agency Law provides that "[a]ny person
aggrieved by an adjudication of a Commonwealth
agency who has a direct interest
in such adjudication shall have the
right to appeal therefrom to the court
vested with jurisdiction of such appeals."<SUP>[FN]</SUP>
2 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 702. Pertinent
here, the Commonwealth Court has "exclusive
jurisdiction of appeals from final
orders of government agencies," including
"[a]ll appeals from Commonwealth
agencies under Subchapter A of Chapter
7 of Title 2 (relating to judicial review of
Commonwealth agency action)." 42 Pa.
C.S.[A.] &sect; 763(a)(1)....

<B22><SUP>[FN]</SUP> An "[a]djudication" is defined for
purposes of the Administrative Agency
Law as "[a]ny final order, decree, decision,
determination or ruling by an
agency affecting personal or property
rights, privileges, immunities, duties, liabilities
or obligations of any or all of the
parties to the proceeding in which the
adjudication is made." 2 Pa.C.S.[A.]
&sect; 101.

<P00><EMBI>Glenn O. Hawbaker,</EMBI> 304 A.3d at 1087
(footnote in original).

<P20>Thus, Plaintiffs had an adequate statutory
remedy available from the DEP's issuance
of the blasting permit. The administrative
appeal process afforded Plaintiffs
the opportunity for mediation, as well as
an opportunity to apply for a supersedeas
during any appeal. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 35 P.S.
&sect; 7514(d)(1)(i), (h).

<P20>Similarly, the ACHD Code afforded
Plaintiffs an administrative remedy.
The ACHD Code provides:

<B22><EMB>&sect; 2101.11 PROHIBITION OF AIR
POLLUTION</EMB>

<B24>a. It shall be a violation of this Article
to fail to comply with, or to cause or
assist in the violation of, any requirement
of this Article, or any order
or permit issued pursuant to
authority granted by this Article. No
person shall willfully, negligently, or
through the failure to provide and
operate necessary control equipment
or to take necessary precautions, operate
any source of air contaminants
in such manner that emissions from
such source:

<B46>1. Exceed the amounts permitted by
this Article or by any order or
permit issued pursuant to this Article;

<B46>2. Cause an exceedance of the ambient

by &sect; 2101.10 of this Article;
or

<B46>3. May reasonably be anticipated to
endanger the public health, safety,
or welfare.

<B24>b. It shall be a violation of this Article
for any person to:

<B46>1. Operate, or allow to be operated,
any source in such manner as to
allow the release of air contaminants
into the open air or to cause
air pollution as defined in this Article,
except as is explicitly permitted
by this Article;

<B66>....

<B24>c. It shall be a violation of this Article
for any person to cause a public
nuisance, or to cause air, soil, or
water pollution resulting from any
air pollution emission....

<P00>ACHD Code &sect; 2101.11. The ACHD Code
provides, "[a]ny violation of this Article
shall constitute a nuisance." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> &sect; 2010.13.

<P20>The Article XXI of the ACHD Code
provides an appeal process for the grant or
denial of a permit issued by the ACHD:

<B24>1. Any person who is aggrieved by the
denial or rejection of a permit application
or revocation of a permit required
by this Article, or the issuance
or reissuance of such permit
with conditions, or any person who
participated in the public comment
process for a permit, shall have the
right to file an appeal pursuant to
the provisions of Article XI, Rules
and Regulations of the Allegheny
County Health Department, or in
accordance with such other procedures
as may hereafter be established
by the Board of County Commissioners.

<B24>2. In all such cases involving the provisions
of this Part, a hearing granted
pursuant to this Subsection:

<B44>....

<B44>B. Shall be held before a Hearing
Officer who represents the public interest
and does not derive any significant
portion of his income from persons
subject to this Article within the
meaning in Part A of this Article;
except that, if a panel of three (3) or
more persons is appointed to hear the
case, a majority of the panel shall
represent the public interest and shall
not derive any significant portion of
his income from persons subject to
this Article. Prior to being appointed
as a Hearing Officer, each proposed
appointee shall file with the Chief
Clerk of the County of Allegheny a
Disclosure Statement as required by
Part I of this Article. Said Disclosure
Statement shall be subject to the public
inspection provisions of Part I.

<B24>3. In any such administrative hearing,
the person filing the appeal shall
bear the burden of proof and the
burden of going forward with respect
to all issues.

<P00>ACHD Code &sect; 2102.03(h). In the event
Plaintiffs disagreed with the ACHD's determination,
they could file an appeal to
the common pleas court,<fnr6> and a subsequent
appeal to the Commonwealth Court. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 763. Thus, the ACHD afforded
Plaintiffs an administrative remedy
for the issuance of a permit under its
provisions.
<Page 639>

<P20>We further observe that Plaintiffs
failed to appeal Springdale Borough's issuance
of a permit. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Springdale Borough
Code &sect; 225-4 (Board of Appeals). Plaintiffs
could have appealed the issuance of the
permit, or challenged the violation of the
Sunshine Act, through an appeal to the
common pleas court. <EMBI>See</EMBI> n.5 <EMBI>supra.</EMBI> Instead,
they circumvented the administrative
process through an equity action.

<P20>Our Supreme Court has recognized
that an "unjustified failure to follow
the administrative scheme undercuts the
foundation upon which the administrative
process was founded." <EMBI>Shenango Valley
Osteopathic Hosp. v. Dep't of Health,</EMBI> 499
Pa. 39, 451 A.2d 434, 438 (1982). The "premature
interruption of the administrative
process restricts the agency's opportunity
to develop an adequate factual record, limits
the agency in the exercise of its expertise
and impedes the development of a
cohesive body of law in that area." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> "It
is therefore clearly appropriate to defer
judicial review when the question presented
is one within the agency's specialization
and when the administrative remedy is as
likely as the judicial remedy to provide the
desired result." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Although Plaintiffs cite our Supreme
Court's decision <EMBI>Machipongo,</EMBI> we conclude
their reliance is misplaced. Plaintiffs argue,

<B22>[t]he Supreme Court has previously held
that even where a permit is validly issued
by the DEP, a party may still file
for injunctive relief should the use of
that permit cause a nuisance (or other
damage). <EMBI>Machipongo</EMBI> [<EMBI>Land & Coal
Co. Inc. v. DEP</EMBI>], 799 A.2d 751....

<P00>Plaintiffs' Brief at 38. In <EMBI>Machipongo,</EMBI>
however, the Supreme Court was asked to
address a situation wherein property owners
(Property Owners) claimed a regulation
effectuated a taking of their property,
as it banned their coal mining operations.

<P00><EMBI>Machipongo,</EMBI> 799 A.2d at 755. The <EMBI>Machipongo</EMBI>
Court observed, that, in addressing
the issue of a taking, the Commonwealth
Court had

<B22>recited factors that the U.S. Supreme
Court has identified as relevant to the
determination of whether a categorical
taking had occurred:

<B22>whether the public interest requires regulatory
interference with the property
right;

<B22>whether the regulation is reasonably related
to that goal;

<B22>whether the amount of property taken
deprives an owner of all economical viable
uses of the property, measured by
what is taken (the numerator) against
what was left (the denominator); [and]

<B22>whether the property owner's actions or
proposed actions would cause a nuisance.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 759 (citation omitted).

<P20>The Supreme Court ultimately remanded
to the Commonwealth Court to consider
whether the proposed use, <EM>i.e.,</EM> mining,
would pollute water, thereby constituting a
nuisance under the Clean Streams Act, 35
P.S. &sect; 691.3:

<B22>[The Supreme Court] remand[s] this
case to the Commonwealth Court to consider
evidence that the proposed use
would constitute a nuisance. If, after a
factual inquiry that court determines
that the Property Owners' activities
would unreasonably interfere with the
public right to unpolluted water, the ruling
of the court based upon decisions of
this Court and the U.S. Supreme Court
should be clear. <EMB>The government is not
required to pay Property Owners to
refrain from taking action on their
land that would have the effect of
polluting public waters.</EMB> Indeed, despite
our conviction that private property
rights are to be strongly protected,
<Page 640>
we are struck by the impropriety of
taking action that would require the
General Assembly to pay someone not to
pollute public water or destroy public
fisheries.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 775 (emphasis added).

<P20>Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs asked
the trial court to enjoin blasting, an activity
expressly regulated by statute and regulations.
Plaintiffs asked the trial court to
invoke its equitable jurisdiction, without
exhausting their administrative remedies.
We conclude this failure deprived the trial
court of equitable jurisdiction to issue a
preliminary injunction. The EHB Act provides
an appropriate remedy, which includes
a supersedeas to protect against
irreparable harm. The ACHD Code likewise
affords an administrative remedy for
the alleged harm.

<B22>As a rule, where an adequate administrative
process is available, a party may
not forgo that process in favor of seeking
judicial relief. <EMBI>Bayada Nurses, Inc.
v. Com., Dep't of Labor and Indus.,</EMBI> 607
Pa. 527, 8 A.3d 866, 875 (2010); <EMBI>Empire
Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Commonwealth,
Dep't of Envtl. Res.,</EMBI> 546 Pa.
315, 684 A.2d 1047, 1053 (1996). Instead,
the party must first exhaust its administrative
remedies before proceeding to
court....

<P00><EMBI>SEPTA v. City of Philadelphia,</EMBI> 627 Pa.
470, 101 A.3d 79, 90 (2014).

<P20>In addition, <EMB>the trial court's order, itself,
directed Plaintiffs to pursue their
administrative remedies</EMB> before the appropriate
administrative tribunals. As stated
above, the trial court ordered the parties
to submit a comprehensive plan to the
DEP and ACHD for review and input.
Trial Court Order, 12/10/23, &para; 3. The trial
court directed Plaintiffs to "request that
the DEP condition approval" of any permit
on a joint comprehensive plan developed
by the parties. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> &para; 4. The trial court did
not direct the DEP to accept the comprehensive
plan.

<P20>We further observe that the trial court's
retention of jurisdiction, following the exhaustion
of Plaintiffs' administrative remedies,
is problematic. The trial court apparently
would review the agencies' respective
determinations following their consideration
of the joint comprehensive plan and
their ultimate resolution of Plaintiffs' assertions.
Review of DEP's determinations,
however, is within the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Commonwealth Court. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 42
Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 763.

<P20>For the forgoing reasons, we conclude
the trial court erred in exercising its equitable
jurisdiction and granting Plaintiffs'
request for a preliminary injunction. Accordingly,
we reverse the trial court's order
granting a preliminary injunction
against Appellants.

<P20>Order reversed. Superior Court jurisdiction
relinquished.
<FN>
<fnt1> A preliminary injunction, although interlocutory,
is nevertheless immediately appealable
as of right under Pa.R.A.P. 311(a)(4).

<fnt2> In their brief, Charah asserts the following:

<B22>[Plaintiffs] incorrectly sued Charah. Cheswick
Environmental Redevelopment
Group, LLC, not Charah, is the owner of
the [Power Plant] Site involved in this matter.

<P00>Appellant Charah's Brief at 6 n.1.

<fnt3> As the trial court explained in its opinion,
all references to testimony ("H.T.") are to
testimony taken intermittently from September
20, 2023[,] to November 15, 2023[,]
at a preliminary injunction hearing....

<P00>Trial Court Opinion, 1/25/24, at 3 n.2.

<fnt4> Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on
September 18, 2023, and a second amended
complaint on October 18, 2023.

<fnt5> Although Plaintiffs filed a complaint in equity
for an injunction, the trial court <EM>sua sponte</EM>
considered the complaint as an "emergency
motion" for a <EM>preliminary</EM> injunction. No
emergency motion is of record.

<fnt6> <EMBI>See</EMBI> 2 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 752 ("Any person aggrieved

<P20>OPINION BY <author>MURRAY</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Jordan Torres (Appellant) appeals from
the judgment of sentence imposed following
his negotiated guilty plea to one count
each of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse
(IDSI) with a child and endangering
the welfare of a child (EWOC).<fnr1> After
careful review, we affirm.

<P20>Between March and April 2021, Appellant
forced his seven-year-old cousin, M.C.,
to perform oral sex on him. These incidents
occurred during times when Appellant
was responsible for supervising M.C.

<P20>Based on the allegations, the Commonwealth
charged Appellant, via criminal
complaint, with rape of a child and several
related offenses. Appellant waived his arraignment.

<P20>On April 28, 2023, Appellant, who was
represented by Laurence Narcisi, Esquire
(plea counsel), entered a negotiated guilty
plea to IDSI with a child and EWOC.<fnr2> On
the same date, the trial court sentenced
Appellant, in accordance with the plea
agreement, to 5&frac12; to 12 years in prison,
followed by three years' probation.<fnr3> The
trial court ordered Appellant to submit to
lifetime registration as a Tier III sexual
offender under the Sexual Offender Notification
and Registration Act (SORNA). <EMBI>See</EMBI>
42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9799.15. Further, the court
directed completion of a sexually violent
predator (SVP) evaluation, and stated the
Commonwealth would determine whether
an SVP hearing would be required. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
N.T., 4/28/23, at 21. On May 1, 2023, the
trial court entered an order directing the
Sexual Offenders Assessment Board
(SOAB) to complete an SVP assessment.

<P20>On May 8, 2023, prior to the completion
of the SVP assessment, Appellant filed a
motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The
trial court issued an order directing Appellant's
counsel to file 1) a supplemental
motion stating the grounds for the motion
with specificity, and 2) a memorandum addressing
whether the motion should be
considered a pre- or post-sentence motion
to withdraw.<fnr4> Order, 5/15/23 (citing <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Schrader,</EMBI> 141 A.3d 558, 561
(Pa. Super. 2016) (holding that "where a
defendant pleads guilty and waives a pre-sentence
SVP determination, the judgment
of sentence is not final until that determination
is rendered")).

<P20>Appellant subsequently retained, Laurie
R. Jubelirer, Esquire (Attorney Jubelirer),
to represent him. The trial court granted
an extension of time for Appellant to file a
supplemental motion to withdraw his
guilty plea in light of the change in counsel.
On July 2, 2023, Appellant, through
Attorney Jubelirer, filed a supplemental
motion asserting his innocence. Additionally,
Appellant alleged he had notified plea
counsel on April 30, 2023 (the day before
the trial court issued its order directing
<Page 644>
completion of an SVP assessment), that he
wished to withdraw his guilty plea. Appellant
also argued plea counsel failed to 1)
conduct an investigation of his case, 2)
interview witnesses, 3) advise Appellant
concerning possible defenses he could raise
if he proceeded to trial, 4) discuss potential
deportation consequences, and 5) permit
him to speak with his mother before deciding
whether to plead guilty. Supplemental
Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea, 7/2/23,
&para;&para; 3, 5, 14. In sum, Appellant states, "no
other viable options besides a guilty plea in
this matter were discussed with him." <EMBI>Id.,</EMBI>
&para; 14.<fnr5> In his accompanying memorandum,
Appellant argued his motion should be addressed
as a presentence motion to withdraw
his guilty plea.

<P20>The Commonwealth filed an answer.
Therein, the Commonwealth stated the
SOAB had completed its assessment of
Appellant and determined Appellant does
not meet the criteria to be deemed an
SVP. The Commonwealth agreed that Appellant's
motion to withdraw should be
assessed using the presentence motion to
withdraw guilty plea standard. Answer,
7/24/23, &para; 5. However, the Commonwealth
argued Appellant's claims were "self-serving
and insincere." <EMBI>Id.,</EMBI> &para; 7. The Commonwealth
also alleged that Appellant's mother
threatened M.C.'s mother the night
before the guilty plea hearing, and Appellant
should not be permitted to benefit
from his family's attempted witness intimidation.
<EMBI>Id.,</EMBI> &para;&para; 3, 12.

<P20>On August 9, 2023, the trial court conducted
a hearing on Appellant's motion to
withdraw his guilty plea. At that time, the
Commonwealth confirmed the SOAB's
evaluation "did not indicate a basis for the
Commonwealth to proceed with a praecipe
to have an SVP hearing." N.T. (Motion to
Withdraw), 8/9/23, at 3. After testimony by
Appellant and arguments by counsel, the
trial court continued the hearing.

<P20>The motion to withdraw hearing resumed
on November 8, 2023. During the
hearing, the trial court heard testimony
from plea counsel, Appellant's mother,
Hatfield Police Detective William Steinberg,
and Appellant's aunt. At the close of
the hearing, the trial court denied Appellant's
motion to withdraw his guilty plea.
The trial court stated,

<B22><EMB>based upon the Commonwealth's notice
that there is not going to be an
SVP hearing, this [c]ourt's order and
sentence dated April 28th of 2023 is
now a final order for purposes of post-sentence
motions and appeal.</EMB>

<P00>N.T., 11/8/23, at 124 (emphasis added). The
following day, the trial court entered an
order declaring Appellant's sentence final
as of November 8, 2023, for purposes of
appeal.

<P20>On December 5, 2023, Appellant filed a
notice of appeal. The trial court subsequently
permitted Attorney Jubelirer to
withdraw and appointed James F. Berardinelli,
Esquire, as appellate counsel. Appellant
and the trial court have complied with
Pa.R.A.P. 1925.

<P20>Appellant raises the following issue for
review:

<B22>Did the [trial] court err in denying [Appellant's]
motion to withdraw his guilty
plea where [Appellant] proffered a plausible
claim of innocence which was corroborated
by his denial of the allegations
when they came to light, the fact that
the plea was entered under duress
caused by [plea] counsel's lack of preparation,
the motive of [M.C.'s] mother to
fabricate the allegations to obtain a U-Visa,
<Page 645>
and [Appellant's] good character[,]
and the Commonwealth failed to establish
that any prejudice would result from
the withdrawal?

<P00>Appellant's Brief at 3.

<P20>Preliminary, we must address the
unique procedural posture of this case, as
it implicates both the timeliness of Appellant's
motion to withdraw his guilty plea
and the timeliness of the instant appeal.
<EMBI>See generally Commonwealth v. Parker,</EMBI>
173 A.3d 294, 296 (Pa. Super. 2017) ("A
court may consider the issue of jurisdiction
<EM>sua sponte.</EM>"); <EMBI>see also</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 341(a)
(permitting appeals from final orders). In a
criminal case, an appeal lies from the judgment
of sentence. <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Lawrence,</EMBI>
99 A.3d 116, 117 n.1 (Pa. Super.
2014).

<P20>Ordinarily, the "date of imposition
of the sentence is the date the sentencing
court pronounces the sentence."
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Green,</EMBI> 862 A.2d 613,
621 (Pa. Super. 2004) (<EM>en banc</EM>). However,
this Court has explained that in cases involving
sexually violent offenses, the determination
of whether a defendant is an SVP
under SORNA is a component of a judgment
of sentence. <EMBI>See Schrader,</EMBI> 141 A.3d
at 561-62 (recognizing that although an
SVP designation is a non-punitive collateral
consequence of a criminal sentence, it is
a component of the judgment of sentence).

<P20>Section 9799.24 (Assessments) of
SORNA provides: "After conviction but
<EMB>before sentencing,</EMB> a court shall order an
individual convicted of a sexually violent
offense to be assessed by" the SOAB. 42
Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9799.24(a) (emphasis added). A
defendant may waive his right to a pre-sentence
assessment by the SOAB. <EMBI>See generally
Schrader,</EMBI> 141 A.3d at 561, 563 (explaining
the appellant had expressly
waived his right to a pre-sentence assessment
and SVP determination as part of a
negotiated guilty plea); <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Whanger,</EMBI> 30 A.3d 1212, 1214 (Pa. Super.
2011) (stating the appellant executed a
document waiving his right to a pre-sentence
SVP assessment).

<P20>Instantly, Appellant entered a negotiated
guilty plea to IDSI and EWOC. During
the guilty plea hearing, the trial court
informed Appellant that he would have to
undergo an SVP assessment, and that the
SVP determination is a separate proceeding.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 4/28/23, at 14. The court
explained that, depending on the SOAB's
assessment and recommendation, the
Commonwealth would decide whether to
praecipe the court for an SVP designation.
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI>; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> 42 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 9799.24(e)(1) ("A hearing to determine
whether the individual is a sexually violent
predator shall be scheduled upon the praecipe
filed by the district attorney."), (3)
("At the hearing <EMB>prior to sentencing,</EMB> the
court shall determine whether the Commonwealth
has proved by clear and convincing
evidence that the individual is a
sexually violent predator." (emphasis added)).
Appellant confirmed his understanding
of this information. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 4/28/23,
at 14-15.

<P20>The trial court did not inform Appellant
of Section 9799.24(a)'s requirement that
the assessment take place <EMB>prior to sentencing,</EMB>
nor did Appellant expressly waive
that right during the plea hearing. Moreover,
our review of Appellant's written
guilty plea colloquy and the addendum for
sexual offenders reveals no written waiver
of this right. <EMBI>But see</EMBI> N.T. (Motion to
Withdraw Hearing), 8/9/23, at 3 (wherein
the trial court indicated its understanding
that Appellant waived his right for a pre-sentence
SVP determination). Though the
trial court did not comply with Section
9799.24, Appellant does not challenge this
error. We therefore discern no prejudice
<Page 646>
caused by the post-sentence assessment by
the SOAB.

<P20>Nevertheless, there remains the question
of when or if Appellant's judgment of
sentence became final. In <EMBI>Schrader,</EMBI> this
Court considered the finality of a judgment
of sentence where the defendant
waives his presentence SOAB assessment
as part of a guilty plea. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 141 A.3d at
561. The defendant in <EMBI>Schrader</EMBI> pled guilty
to indecent assault of a person less than 13
years old. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 561. As part of the plea
agreement, the defendant expressly
waived his right to undergo an SOAB assessment
prior to sentencing. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 561,
563. The trial court sentenced the defendant
immediately after accepting his guilty
plea. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 561. Several months later, the
trial court conducted an SVP hearing, after
which it designated the defendant an
SVP. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>The defendant appealed, challenging the
discretionary aspects of his sentence, as
well as his SVP designation. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Before
considering the merits of the defendant's
claims, this Court considered whether the
defendant timely filed his appeal. We concluded
that "where a defendant pleads
guilty and waives a pre-sentence SVP determination,
<EMB>the judgment of sentence is
not final until that determination is rendered.</EMB>"
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (emphasis added).

<P20>Though <EMBI>Schrader</EMBI> is not directly applicable
to the instant case, it is instructive.
Instantly, Appellant entered his guilty plea
on April 28, 2023. As we previously stated,
at that time, Appellant was informed that
he would be required to undergo an assessment
to determine whether he met the
requirements to be classified as an SVP.
On May 1, 2023, the trial court entered an
order directing the SOAB to complete an
assessment. Section 9799.24(d) directs that
the SOAB "shall have 90 days from the
date of conviction of the individual to submit
a written report containing its assessment
to the district attorney." 42 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 9799.24(d).

<P20>Shortly thereafter, on May 8, 2023,
Appellant filed his motion to withdraw his
guilty plea. Because Appellant filed the
motion well before the time within which
the SOAB was required to complete an
SVP assessment, we conclude Appellant's
judgment of sentence was not final at the
time he filed the motion. Therefore, the
trial court properly addressed Appellant's
motion as a pre-sentence motion to withdraw
his guilty plea.

<P20>We now turn to the issue of whether
Appellant's notice of appeal lies from a
final judgment of sentence. Unlike in
<EMBI>Schrader,</EMBI> the trial court never conducted
an SVP hearing or determined whether
Appellant meets the requirements for SVP
designation.

<P20>Regarding SVP hearings, Section
9799.24(e)(1) instructs that an SVP hearing
"shall be scheduled upon the praecipe filed
by the district attorney." 42 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 9799.24(e)(1). Therefore, while Section
9799.24 requires the trial court to order
completion of an SVP assessment, it does
not require the Commonwealth to proceed
with an SVP hearing. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI>; <EMBI>see also
Commonwealth v. Baird,</EMBI> 856 A.2d 114,
118 (Pa. Super. 2004) (stating that "the
district attorney decides whether to file a
praecipe for a hearing whereby the court
will determine if an offender meets the
SVP criteria....").<fnr6>
<Page 647>

<B22>In other words, an SVP hearing does
not automatically occur after receipt of
the SOAB report, ... but, rather, <EMB>the
district attorney decides whether to
pursue the SVP classification by filing,
or not filing, a praecipe for an
SVP hearing.</EMB> Thus, if the district attorney
does not file a praecipe, then there
would be no SVP determination hearing.

<P00><EMBI>Baird,</EMBI> 856 A.2d at 118 (emphasis added).

<P20>Here, the Commonwealth did not
praecipe for an SVP hearing. Indeed, the
Commonwealth stated during the first motion
to withdraw hearing that, based on
the SOAB's evaluation, it would not praecipe
for an SVP hearing. N.T., 8/9/23, at 3.
We would conclude Appellant's judgment
of sentence became final at the time the
Commonwealth provided notice that it
would not pursue an SVP designation, as
that notice effectively finalized the SVP
component of Appellant's sentence. However,
as we have determined the trial court
properly considered Appellant's motion as
a <EMB>pre-sentence</EMB> motion to withdraw his
guilty plea, the court was required to complete
the motion to withdraw hearing and
dispose of the motion. Thus, we agree with
the trial court that Appellant's judgment of
sentence became final on November 8,
2023. At that time, the court had rendered
a decision on Appellant's motion to withdraw,
and both the sentence and SVP determination
(in this case, the Commonwealth's
notice that it would not pursue an
SVP hearing) had been entered. We therefore
conclude Appellant's December 5,
2023, notice of appeal was timely filed.

<P20>Having concluded Appellant's timely
filed his appeal, we turn to the merits of
his claim. Appellant argues he promptly
filed his motion to withdraw 10 days after
pleading guilty. Appellant's Brief at 17.
Appellant claims plea counsel "bullied" him
into pleading guilty by presenting no other
options other than the plea. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 18.

<B22>Moreover, through new counsel, [Appellant]
articulated a plausible defense
strategy that he wished to pursue,
namely, contending that the allegations
against him had been fabricated by
[M.C.'s] mother to enable her to obtain a
U-Visa....

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI><fnr7> Appellant maintains he is innocent of
the charged offenses. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 18-19. Additionally,
Appellant contends the Commonwealth
did not establish it would suffer
prejudice if Appellant withdrew his plea.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 19.

<P20>"It is well[]settled that the decision
whether to permit a defendant to withdraw
a guilty plea is within the sound discretion
of the trial court." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Kehr,</EMBI> 180 A.3d 754, 757 (Pa. Super. 2018)
(citation omitted); <EMBI>see also</EMBI> Pa.R.Crim.P.
591(A) ("At any time before the imposition
of sentence, the court may, in its discretion,
permit, upon motion of the defendant,
... the withdrawal of a plea of
guilty....").

<P20>Pre-sentence motions to withdraw
should be liberally allowed. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.
R.Crim.P. 591, cmt. ("After the attorney
for the Commonwealth has an opportunity
to respond, a request to withdraw a plea
made before sentencing should be liberally
<Page 648>
allowed."); <EMBI>see also Islas,</EMBI> 156 A.3d at
1187-88.

<B22>In determining whether to grant a presentence
motion for withdrawal of a
guilty plea, the test to be applied by the
trial courts is fairness and justice. If the
trial court finds "any fair and just reason[,"]
withdrawal of the plea before
sentence should be freely permitted, unless
the prosecution has been "substantially
prejudiced."

<P00><EMBI>Islas,</EMBI> 156 A.3d at 1188 (brackets and citation
omitted). Further, "when a defendant
files a presentence motion to withdraw a
guilty plea based upon a claim of innocence,
the innocence claim must be at least
plausible to demonstrate, in and of itself, a
fair and just reason for presentence withdrawal
of a plea." <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Norton,</EMBI>
650 Pa. 569, 201 A.3d 112, 120 (2019)
(citation and quotation marks omitted).

<P20>We first observe that Appellant's original
motion to withdraw his plea did not
include even a bare assertion of innocence.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Motion to Withdraw Negotiated Guilty
Plea, 5/8/23. In fact, the motion to withdraw
merely alleges that Appellant informed
plea counsel he wished to withdraw
his plea, and that plea counsel advised him
against doing so. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI>

<P20>Appellant first asserted his innocence
in his supplemental motion to withdraw.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Supplemental Motion to Withdraw
Guilty Plea, 7/2/23, &para;&para; 13-14. During
the motion to withdraw hearing, Appellant
stated he was innocent of the charges
against him. N.T., 8/9/23, at 15. As the trial
court stated, "[Appellant] attempted to
support a claim of innocence by testifying,
<EM>inter alia,</EM> that he had lied under oath at
the guilty plea hearing when he admitted
to having forced his minor cousin to perform
oral sex on him." Trial Court Opinion,
2/5/24, at 12. Appellant did not identify
any additional evidence to support his innocence,
nor did he establish that he maintained
his innocence from the time the
case was initiated. <EMBI>See Commonwealth v.
Carrasquillo,</EMBI> 631 Pa. 692, 115 A.3d 1284,
1285 (2015) (stating that "a bare assertion
of innocence is not, in and of itself, a
sufficient reason to require a court" to
grant a presentence motion to withdraw a
guilty plea).

<P20>Appellant identifies several additional
arguments, which he believes support his
claim of innocence. In general, Appellant
argues 1) plea counsel failed to investigate
possible defenses, including a possible motive
&mdash;<EM>i. e.,</EM> the opportunity to obtain a U-Visa
&mdash;for family members to fabricate the
allegations against him; 2) he was unable
to discuss with plea counsel the possible
deportation consequences of pleading
guilty; and 3) he was not given the opportunity
to speak with his mother before
entering the plea. We observe that portions
of Appellant's arguments would be
better suited for analysis under the post-sentence
motion to withdraw guilty plea
context or through a petition under the
Post Conviction Collateral Relief Act, 42
Pa.C.S.A. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546.

<P20>Nevertheless, the trial court addressed
these arguments and concluded Appellant
failed to present a fair and just reason
warranting the withdrawal of his guilty
plea. Trial Court Opinion, 2/5/24, at 10.
The trial court reasoned:

<B22>[Appellant] was a 20-year-old high
school graduate at the time he entered
into a negotiated guilty plea. [Appellant]
stated he understood the presumption of
innocence and that he had the right to a
trial where he could challenge witnesses,
present witnesses and where the Commonwealth
would have to prove all the
elements of the charged crimes to 12
individual jurors beyond a reasonable
doubt. [Appellant] further affirmed that
he had discussed with his attorney the
potential immigration consequences of
<Page 649>
his plea, including deportation. He indicated
he was satisfied with [plea counsel's]
representation and that he had no
questions for [plea] counsel or the court
before pleading guilty. [The trial] court
further advised [Appellant] that he did
not have to accept the factual basis and
plead guilty, but <EMB>[Appellant] nevertheless
admitted under oath that he
forced his then seven-year-old cousin
to perform oral sex on him.</EMB> [Appellant]
also executed a written guilty plea colloquy
in which he affirmed that he was
satisfied with [plea counsel's] representation,
that he had had sufficient time to
talk with his attorney before deciding to
plead guilty[,] and that he understood
the possible immigration consequences
of his guilty plea.

<B42>At the subsequent hearing on his motion
to withdraw his plea, [Appellant]
attempted to support a claim of innocence
by testifying, <EM>inter alia,</EM> that he
had lied under oath at the guilty plea
hearing when he admitted to having
forced his minor cousin to perform oral
sex on him. [The trial] court did not
abuse its discretion in finding [Appellant]
did not demonstrate a fair and just
reason to withdraw the guilty plea based
on his incredible, self-serving testimony
that he lied before but [i]s telling the
truth now.

<B42>Conversely, the Commonwealth presented
the transcript from [Appellant's]
preliminary hearing, at which [M.C.] testified.
Plea counsel, who had the opportunity
to cross-examine [M.C.] at the
proceeding, testified to his impressions
of [M.C.] and the impact [her] testimony
could have at trial. Plea counsel's credible
testimony on these points presented
a further basis for this court to find no
plausible claim of innocence.

<B42>[Appellant] seems to suggest in his
[Rule 1925(b)] concise statement, however,
that his claim of innocence is supported
by his having denied the allegations
when they first came to light. He
did not assert in his original or supplemental
motion, however, that he had
denied the allegations when they first
came to light. [Appellant] further had a
full and fair opportunity to testify at the
August 9, 2023, motion hearing and did
not make any such claim....

<P00>Trial Court Opinion, 2/5/24, at 11-12 (citations
to record omitted).

<P20>Moreover, during his guilty plea colloquy,
Appellant expressly confirmed he had
discussed with plea counsel the potential
impact of pleading guilty on his immigration
status. N.T., 4/28/23, at 8. During the
first motion to withdraw hearing, Appellant
initially testified that plea counsel had
never spoken with him about the possibility
of deportation. N.T., 8/9/23, at 16. During
cross-examination, Appellant conceded
his prior acknowledgement that counsel
discussed with him the deportation consequences,
and stated his previous testimony
was truthful. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 30-32, 35-36, 38-40.
At the second motion to withdraw hearing,
plea counsel testified he and Appellant had
discussed "the immigration implication[.]"
N.T., 11/8/23, at 37. The trial court credited
plea counsel's testimony. Trial Court
Opinion 2/5/24, at 15.

<P20>Regarding Appellant's claim that M.C.'s
mother fabricated the report of sexual conduct
in order to obtain a U-Visa, the trial
court reasoned:

<B22>[Appellant] utterly failed to demonstrate
a basis for this court to credit that claim,
presenting nothing but bald speculation
about such an alleged motivation. In
contrast, evidence presented at the motion
hearing demonstrated that the incidents
were not reported to law enforcement
by [M.C.] or her family in the first
instance; [M.C.] told a friend at school,
which eventually led to the school making
the initial report. Plea counsel,
moreover, testified credibly to his impressions
<Page 650>
of [M.C.] as a witness at the
preliminary hearing, to his understanding
of the U-Visa process[,] and to the
reasons why he did not believe it presented
a plausible defense. [Plea counsel]
also testified credibly that he had
discussed the issue with [Appellant],
along with other possible defenses, and
that [Appellant] nevertheless made the
decision to plead guilty.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 15-16 (citations to record omitted).

<P20>The trial court further rejected Appellant's
contention that plea counsel "bullied"
him into entering a guilty plea:

<B22>[Appellant] ... asserted that his claim
of innocence is corroborated by his claim
that he entered into a negotiated guilty
plea under duress occasioned by plea
counsel's alleged lack of preparation.<SUP>[FN]</SUP>
As an initial matter, ... [Appellant] testified
under oath at the guilty plea
[hearing] that he understood the presumption
of innocence and that he had
the right to a trial where he could challenge
Commonwealth witnesses. [Appellant]
indicated he was satisfied with
[plea counsel's] representation and that
he had no questions for counsel or the
court before pleading guilty. [Appellant]
also executed a written guilty plea colloquy
in which he affirmed that he was
satisfied with [plea counsel's] representation
and that he had had sufficient
time to talk with his attorney before
deciding to plead guilty.

<B22><SUP>[FN]</SUP> To the extent [Appellant's] claims
sound in allegations of plea counsel ineffectiveness,
they must await post-conviction
proceedings. <EMBI>See Commonwealth v.
Rosenthal,</EMBI> 233 A.3d 880, 886 (Pa. Super.
2020) (citations omitted).

<B42>This court did not credit [Appellant's]
subsequent, self-serving testimony to
the contrary at the motion [to withdraw]
hearing and, in any event, it did not
support a plausible claim of innocence.
Rather, this court found credible plea
counsel's extensive testimony at the motion
hearing about his discussions with
[Appellant] and that [Appellant] ultimately
made the decision to plead guilty.
This court, therefore, properly found
that [Appellant] did not assert a plausible
claim of innocence or a fair and just
reason to withdraw his plea. Instead,
[Appellant] was informed of the evidence
against him, the advantages and risks of
going to trial or entering a guilty plea[,]
and the possible defenses he could present.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 16-17 (footnote in original; some
citations omitted).

<P20>The trial court's conclusions are sound,
and its credibility determinations are supported
by the record. <EMBI>See Norton,</EMBI> 201
A.3d at 121 (stating that, in exercising its
discretion over a pre-sentence motion to
withdraw a guilty plea, a trial court must
"make credibility determinations that are
supported by the record"). We agree with
the trial court's conclusion that Appellant's
arguments do not support a plausible claim
of innocence.

<P20>Based upon the foregoing, the trial court
did not abuse its discretion in denying
Appellant's presentence motion to withdraw
his guilty plea.

<P20>Judgment of sentence affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt1> <EMBI>See</EMBI> 18 Pa.C.S.A. &sect;&sect; 3123(b), 4304(a)(1).

<fnt2> The original criminal information graded
the EWOC charge as a first-degree misdemeanor.
Pursuant to the plea agreement, the
Commonwealth amended the criminal information
to grade EWOC as a third-degree felony.

<fnt3> The plea agreement contemplated a 5&frac12; to
15-year prison term with a concurrent probationary
term. Because Appellant was subject
to a mandatory 3-year probation term under
42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9718.5, the parties agreed to
modify the maximum prison sentence to give
Appellant the benefit of his bargain. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T.,
4/28/23, at 19-20.

<fnt4> Presentence and post-sentence motions to
withdraw a guilty plea are assessed using
different standards. "Post-sentence motions
are subject to higher scrutiny since courts
strive to discourage entry of guilty pleas as
sentence-testing devices." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Islas,</EMBI> 156 A.3d 1185, 1188 (Pa. Super. 2017)
(citation and brackets omitted). By contrast,
presentence motions to withdraw are more
liberally allowed. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 1188-89.

<fnt5> Appellant attached to his supplemental motion
a public reprimand, issued by the Disciplinary
Board of the Supreme Court, concerning
plea counsel's representation of clients.
Supplemental Motion to Withdraw Guilty
Plea, 7/2/23, Exhibit A.

<fnt6> We note that in <EMBI>Baird,</EMBI> this Court addressed
the process for determining whether an offender
met the SVP criteria under Megan's
Law rather than SORNA. The statutory provision
discussed in our above citation to <EMBI>Baird,</EMBI>
42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9795.4(e)(1) (expired Dec. 20,
2012, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9799.41),
contains identical language to current Section
9799.24(e)(1). Therefore, the <EMBI>Baird</EMBI> Court's
discussion of the SVP procedure remains instructive.

<fnt7> A U-Visa "is a temporary legal status offered
to victims of ... specified crimes who
have cooperated, or are likely to cooperate, in
the investigation and prosecution of those
crimes." <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Hernandez,</EMBI> 242

[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <author>STEVENS</author>, <dgn>P.J.E.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Appellant, Patricia Scarcelli, appeals
from the judgment of sentence entered in
the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia
County following her conviction at a
<Page 653>
bench trial on one count each of terroristic
threats (M1), harassment (M3), and ethnic
intimidation (F3).<fnr1> After a careful review,
we affirm the convictions. However, we
vacate the sentence for 18 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 2706(a)(1), terroristic threats. We affirm
the judgment of sentence in all other respects.

<P20>The relevant facts and procedural history
are as follows: On August 5, 2022, the
Commonwealth filed an Information charging
Appellant with the offenses <EM>supra,</EM> and
on June 6, 2023, Appellant, who was represented
by counsel, proceeded to a bench
trial. At trial, the Commonwealth presented
the testimony of Ann Peters and Benjamin
Green, both of whom are longtime
residents of a "quiet" block with row
homes in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. N.T.
6/6/23, at 10-12. For several decades, Appellant
lived in the house between the
Peters and Green family homes. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Appellant
and Ms. Peters are Caucasian while
Mr. Green is African American. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 24,
27.

<P20>Ms. Peters, who lives next door to Appellant,
testified that, on May 27, 2021, at
approximately 2:00 a.m., she was in her
front bedroom, which faces the street, and
she heard Appellant "outside cursing,
screaming, and yelling threats." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 11,
18. Ms. Peters "peeked" outside and confirmed
it was Appellant. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 18. Ms.
Peters heard Appellant threatening to
shoot her neighbor, Mr. Green, who is
known in the neighborhood as "The Rev"
because he is the reverend of the local
church. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 11. Specifically, Ms. Peters
heard Appellant yell: "Rev, you better get
out. Get your nappy head out here because
I'm going to shoot you." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 14. Ms.
Peters testified that "nappy head" is a
"racial slur." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> She noted that she is
married to an African American man, and
she has previously heard these words directed
towards her husband in a racially
negative manner. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 16.

<P20>Ms. Peters testified she also heard Appellant
yelling that she was going to get
her rifle, and she accused Mr. Green of
"doing something to her house in the attic."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 14. Appellant threatened to
destroy Mr. Green's property and indicated
"he wouldn't be able to get his people to
fix it." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 13. Ms. Peters testified Appellant
"continued on for approximately
twenty minutes," and she was "very angry."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 16, 25. Ms. Peters testified she
felt "nauseous" when she heard Appellant
yelling, and she interpreted Appellant's
words as a threat to Mr. Green. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 13.
Ms. Peters provided a videotape from her
security camera to Mr. Green. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 17.

<P20>On cross-examination, Ms. Peters indicated
she went to the police station with
Mr. Green, and while she was there, she
gave a police statement. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 19-20. The
police statement indicated Ms. Peters reported
the following, in relevant part:

<B42>Two nights ago, [Appellant] was outside
screaming, cursing, threatening to
shoot Reverend Green, as she calls him,
"The Rev," his wife, and myself. This
went on for at least 30 minutes, and I
went out and I said to her, "Who are
you calling out?" I spent a year of
this.... I tried to calm her down, but
then I just went in the house.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 20-21.

<P20>Ms. Peters clarified that she never went
outside, so the police statement was inaccurate
in that respect. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 21. Rather,
she spoke to Appellant through a window.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Mr. Green, who confirmed he lives next
door to Appellant, testified he was home
on May 27, 2021, at 2:00 a.m., when he
heard Appellant making "a lot of noise."
<Page 654>
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 27. He "looked out the window, and
[he] could see that [Appellant] was there."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Appellant was standing between her
driveway and Mr. Green's driveway but
closer to Mr. Green's side. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 37. Appellant
yelled "a lot of expletives ... and
[made] threats to [him], [his] wife, and
[his] mother-in-law." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 27. Mr. Green
indicated Appellant used the "F" word and
made "references to his ethnicity[, which
is] African American." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> He testified Appellant
told him to "bring [his] nappy head
outside so she could shoot and kill [him]."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Mr. Green testified that "nappy head" is
a known racial slur. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 28. He explained
that "[t]he texture of [African American]
hair is something that is deemed derogatory."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Mr. Green testified he felt "very
concerned" and "threatened" by Appellant's
statements. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Mr. Green indicated
he called 911 to report that his neighbor
was threatening to kill him, but the police
did not respond. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 29, 34. He went to
the police station the next day to report
the incident. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 34.

<P20>Mr. Green testified Appellant "for some
reason [has] developed some sort of hatred
or just something racial about [him]." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
at 30. He noted that, during the incident,
Appellant accused him of damaging her
gutters and property; however, Mr. Green
testified that he has done no such thing.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 36. Since this incident, he has been
on "high alert every single day that [he]
comes out the door." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 31.

<P20>At the conclusion of trial, the trial court
found Appellant guilty of the offenses set
forth <EM>supra,</EM> and on September 18, 2023,
Appellant proceeded to a sentencing hearing.
The trial court sentenced Appellant to
three months to twelve months in prison
for Count 1-terroristic threats (M1), and
for Count 3-ethnic intimidation (F3), the
trial court sentenced Appellant to three
months to twelve months in prison. The
sentences were imposed concurrently. No
further penalty was imposed for Count 2-harassment
(M3). Appellant did not file
post-sentence motions; however, she filed a
timely, counseled appeal on October 18,
2023. All Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) requirements
have been met.

<P20>On appeal, Appellant sets forth the following
issues in her "Statement of Questions
Presented" (verbatim):

<B24>A. Was not Ms. Scarcelli erroneously
convicted of 18 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2710, as
the evidence was insufficient to establish
that her conduct was motivated
by racial hatred, where she
threatened both a black neighbor
and white neighbor with whom she
had an ongoing property related
feud?

<B24>B. Did not the trial judge illegally impose
sentences on both ethnic intimidation
and terroristic threats, as 42
Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9765 and caselaw mandate
that those offenses merge for
sentencing purposes?

<P00>Appellant's Brief at 3 (answers omitted).

<P20>In her first issue, Appellant contends
the evidence was insufficient to sustain
her conviction for ethnic intimidation
under 18 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2710(a). Appellant
indicates she made an "avalanche of insults"
and threatened Ms. Peters (who is
Caucasian) and Mr. Green (who is African
American), and, thus, she "does not dispute
her convictions for terroristic threats
and harassment." Appellant's Brief at 8.

<P20>However, she indicates there is no evidence
of any words specifically motivated
by "malicious intention" or "hatred" towards
anyone's race, religion, or national
origin. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> She specifically contends
the "two off-the-cuff references to `nappy-headed'
were rattled off impulsively along
with a hodgepodge of expletives and non-racial
insults hurled at Mr. Green[,]" and
<Page 655>
the use of the phrase does not establish
ethnic intimidation without some further
proof of her intent. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 10. Thus, she
insists her conviction for ethnic intimidation
is not supported by sufficient evidence.

<P20>A claim impugning the sufficiency
of the evidence presents us with a question
of law. <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Widmer,</EMBI>
560 Pa. 308, 744 A.2d 745, 751 (2000). Our
standard of review is well settled:

<B42>The standard we apply in reviewing
the sufficiency of the evidence is whether
viewing all the evidence admitted at
trial in the light most favorable to the
verdict winner, there is sufficient evidence
to enable the fact-finder to find
every element of the crime beyond a
reasonable doubt. In applying the above
test, we may not weigh the evidence and
substitute our judgment for the fact-finder.
In addition, we note that the
facts and circumstances established by
the Commonwealth need not preclude
every possibility of innocence. Any
doubts regarding a defendant's guilt
may be resolved by the fact-finder unless
the evidence is so weak and inconclusive
that as a matter of law no probability
of fact may be drawn from the
combined circumstances. The Commonwealth
may sustain its burden of proving
every element of the crime beyond a
reasonable doubt by means of wholly
circumstantial evidence. Moreover, in
applying the above test, the entire record
must be evaluated and all evidence
actually received must be considered.
Finally, the finder of fact while passing
upon the credibility of witnesses and the
weight of the evidence produced, is free
to believe all, part or none of the evidence.
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Brooks,</EMBI> 7 A.3d 852,
856-57 (Pa. Super. 2010) (citations omitted).

<P20>The Crimes Code provides as follows for
the offense of ethnic intimidation:

<B22><EMB>&sect; 2710. Ethnic intimidation</EMB>

<B22><EMB>(a) Offense defined.</EMB>&mdash;A person commits
the offense of ethnic intimidation if, with
malicious intention toward the race, color,
religion or national origin of another
individual or group of individuals, he
commits an offense under any other provision
of this article or under Chapter 33
(relating to arson, criminal mischief and
other property destruction) exclusive of
section 3307 (relating to institutional
vandalism) or under section 3503 (relating
to criminal trespass) with respect to
such individual or his or her property or
with respect to one or more members of
such group or to their property.

<C5>***

<B22><EMB>(c) Definition.</EMB>&mdash;As used in this section
"malicious intention" means the intention
to commit any act, the commission
of which is a necessary element of any
offense referred to in subsection (a) motivated
by hatred toward the race, color,
religion or national origin of another
individual or group of individuals.

<P00>18 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2710(a), (c) (bold in original).

<P20>Preliminarily, as indicated <EM>supra,</EM> Appellant
does not dispute that she was properly
convicted of terroristic threats, which is a
predicate offense for ethnic intimidation
under Section 2710(a).<fnr2> Appellant's Brief at
8. Moreover, she does not dispute that she
made two statements towards Mr. Green
threatening his "nappy head." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 8.
Viewing the evidence in the light most
<Page 656>
favorable to the Commonwealth, as the
verdict winner, we conclude that the trial
court, as the fact-finder, could find that
Appellant's actions were motivated by malicious
intent towards Mr. Green's race
under the circumstances at issue.

<P20>Relevantly, the trial court explained:

<B42>Both Mr. Green and Ms. Peters testified
that when Appellant used the term
"nappy head," they understood her to be
making a racial slur against [African
American] people, Mr. Green in particular.
N.T. 6/6/23, at 15, 27. Mr. Green was
frightened by Appellant's racial slurs
and threats, and [he] was very concerned
for his family and his family's
lives. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 28.

<C5>***

<B42>The Commonwealth need not prove
that racial animus is the sole motivating
factor to make out a charge of ethnic
intimidation; it must only prove that racial
animus is a motivating factor for the
conduct. Here, ample evidence supported
[the trial] court's conclusion that
Appellant's conduct towards Mr. Green
was at least in part racially motivated.
Appellant repeatedly referred to Mr.
Green as having a "nappy head," a
phrase that has historically been used as
an ethnic slur against [African American]
people. Appellant's anger at her
belief that neighbors were damaging her
property does not, for purposes of the
ethnic intimidation statute, cancel out
the racial animus she displayed in her
language. Indeed, the fact that Appellant
directed her tirade at her [African
American] neighbor, Mr. Green, while
largely ignoring her [Caucasian] neighbor,
Ms. Peters, buttresses [the trial]
court's conclusion that ethnic malice was
a major factor in her decision to behave
as she did.

<P00>Trial Court Opinion, filed 1/22/24, at 3, 6-7
(citation omitted).

<P20>We agree with the trial court's sound
reasoning. The record reveals that Appellant
yelled outside, closer to Mr. Green's
home than her own home, and directed
various insults and profanities towards
him. During this communication, as Appellant
admits, on at least two occasions, she
referred to Mr. Green as having a "nappy
head." Both Commonwealth witnesses testified
to their experience with this phrase
being used with malicious intent against
African Americans.

<P20>We note that we specifically reject Appellant's
claim that, because her racially
motivated language was included with other
expletives and non-racial slurs, we must
conclude that she did not have a "malicious
intention," <EM>i.e.,</EM> her terroristic threats were
not motivated by hatred toward the race of
Mr. Green. She suggests her "motive" was
a paranoid anger regarding someone damaging
her property.

<P20>However, as the trial court aptly
recognized, the malicious intention element
required for an ethnic intimidation
conviction "is satisfied if there is evidence
that ethnic malice was <EM>a</EM> motivator for the
defendant's criminal act; it need not be the
sole motivator." <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Sinnott,</EMBI>
612 Pa. 321, 30 A.3d 1105, 1110 (2011)
(emphasis in original). As our Supreme
Court has held:

<B22>Human beings may act with a single,
exclusive motive; they may act for multiple
reasons. Where one intent is criminal
under [Section] 2710 and the other is
not, the question is not which is primary
or dominant. If the evidence of criminal
intent (here, racial animus) is sufficiently
established, it cannot be negated by establishing
that a second intent coexisted
in the mind of the actor. Such a rule
would lead to an absurd result which the
legislature did not intend. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 1 Pa.
C.S.A. &sect; 1922(1) (legislature does not
<Page 657>
intend result that is absurd, impossible
of execution, or unreasonable).

<P00><EMBI>Sinnott, supra,</EMBI> 30 A.3d at 1110.

<P20>Furthermore, to the extent Appellant
suggests that her conviction for ethnic intimidation
cannot stand because she also
yelled at Ms. Peters, who is Caucasian, we
note that in forming this argument, Appellant
relies on Ms. Peters' cross-examination
wherein she indicated she told the
police that Appellant was yelling at Mr.
Green, Mr. Green's wife, and herself. As
the trial court notes, the testimony establishes
that Appellant's threats were directed
primarily towards Mr. Green, and the
record supports the trial court's conclusion.

<P20>Moreover, the testimony establishes Appellant's
ethnically motivated statements
were clearly and solely directed toward
Mr. Green. Ms. Peters testified Appellant
referred to "The Rev," which is a nickname
for Mr. Green, while making the
references to "nappy head," and Mr.
Green's testimony establishes that, from
context, the phrases were directed at him.
The trial court so found, as was within its
purview. <EMBI>Brooks, supra.</EMBI> Accordingly, we
find no merit to Appellant's sufficiency of
the evidence claim.

<P20>In her second claim, Appellant
contends her sentence is illegal under 42
Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9765. Specifically, she contends
her conviction for terroristic threats
should have merged with her conviction for
ethnic intimidation for sentencing purposes.
In this vein, she argues the crimes
arose from a single criminal act, and all of
the statutory elements of terroristic
threats are included in the statutory elements
for ethnic intimidation. She notes
that, given the grading of the ethnic intimidation
offense as a F3 in this case, the
crime of terroristic threats was the predicate
offense for ethnic intimidation under
Section 2710(b), and, thus, under 42 Pa.
C.S.A. &sect; 9765, the offenses merged. She
highlights that the trial court agrees with
her analysis and recommends in its Pa.
R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion that this Court find
the offenses should have merged for sentencing.<fnr3>

<P20>Whether Appellant's convictions
merge for sentencing is a question implicating
the legality of Appellant's sentence.
Consequently, our standard of review is <EM>de
novo,</EM> and the scope of our review is plenary.
<EMBI>See Commonwealth v. Collins,</EMBI> 564 Pa.
144, 764 A.2d 1056, 1057 n.1 (2001).

<P20>Section 9765, relating to the merger of
sentences, provides:

<B42>No crimes shall merge for sentencing
purposes unless the crimes arise from a
single criminal act and all of the statutory
elements of one offense are included
in the statutory elements of the other
offense. Where crimes merge for sentencing
purposes, the court may sentence
the defendant only on the higher
graded offense.

<P00>42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9765.

<P20>As our Supreme Court has indicated:
"The statute's mandate is clear. It
prohibits merger unless two distinct facts
are present: 1) the crimes arise from a
single criminal act; and 2) all of the statutory
elements of one of the offenses are
included in the statutory elements of the
other." <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Baldwin,</EMBI> 604
Pa. 34, 985 A.2d 830, 833 (2009).

<P20>Here, there is no dispute that the crimes
for which Appellant was convicted "arose
from a single criminal act." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> At issue is
<Page 658>
Appellant's claim that all of the statutory
elements of one of the offenses (terroristic
threats) are included in the statutory elements
of the other offense (ethnic intimidation).
In this vein, she argues her conviction
for terroristic threats was a necessary
underlying element for her conviction for
ethnic intimidation, and, thus, the convictions
merged.

<P20>In resolving Appellant's claim, it is necessary
to, again, examine the language of
the ethnic intimidation statute. The statute
relevantly provides:

<B22><EMB>(a) Offense defined.</EMB>&mdash;A person commits
the offense of ethnic intimidation if, with
malicious intention toward the race, color,
religion or national origin of another
individual or group of individuals, he
commits an offense under any other provision
of this article....

<B22><EMB>(b) Grading.</EMB>&mdash;An offense under this section
shall be classified as a misdemeanor
of the third degree if the other offense is
classified as a summary offense. Otherwise,
an offense under this section shall
be classified one degree higher in the
classification specified in section 106 (relating
to classes of offenses) than the
classification of the other offense.

<P00>18 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2710(a), (b) (bold in original).

<P20>As the statute plainly provides, relevantly,
to be guilty of ethnic intimidation, the
person must commit "an offense under any
other provision of this article[.]"<fnr4> <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> The
relevant article is "Article B. Offenses Involving
Danger to the Person (&sect; 2301 to
&sect; 3220)". A plain reading of the statutory
text clearly provides that "the commission
of the predicate offense is an element of
ethnic intimidation." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Baker-Myers,</EMBI> 667 Pa. 70, 255 A.3d 223,
230 (2021). <EMBI>See Commonwealth v. Magliocco,</EMBI>
584 Pa. 244, 883 A.2d 479 (2005)
(holding the commission of a predicate offense
is a statutory element of the ethnic
intimidation offense).

<P20>Here, while both harassment (M3)
and terroristic threats (M1) are offenses,
which could have been used as the predicate
offense for ethnic intimidation, based
on the grading of the ethnic intimidation
offense as a F3 in this case,<fnr5> the trial
court, as requested by the Commonwealth,
used terroristic threats as the predicate
offense for the crime of ethnic intimidation.
Accordingly, the offense of terroristic
threats should have merged with the
offense of ethnic intimidation for sentencing.
While the trial court imposed separate
sentences for the offenses, it ran the sentences
concurrently. Consequently, because
our disposition does not upset the
trial court's overall sentencing scheme or
affect Appellant's aggregate sentence, we
agree with the trial court's recommendation
that it is unnecessary to remand for
resentencing. <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Thur,</EMBI>
906 A.2d 552 (Pa. Super. 2006).

<P20>Accordingly, we affirm Appellant's convictions.
We vacate solely the sentence for
terroristic threats under 18 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 2706(a)(1), and we do not remand. We
affirm the judgment in all other respects.

<P20>Convictions affirmed. Judgment of sentence
at 18 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2706(a)(1) vacated.
<Page 659>
Judgment of sentence affirmed in all other
respects. Jurisdiction relinquished.
<FN>
<fnt*> Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior
Court.

<fnt1> 18 Pa.C.S.A. &sect;&sect; 2706(a)(1), 2709(a)(4), and
2710(a), respectively.

<fnt2> Appellant was also convicted of harassment,
which is a predicate offense for ethnic intimidation.
However, as discussed <EM>infra,</EM> given the
grading of the offenses, the terroristic threats
offense was the predicate offense in this case.

<fnt3> We note the Commonwealth indicates in its
appellate brief that it concurs with the trial
court's rationale.

<fnt4> The remaining portion of Subsection
2710(a) regarding other predicate offenses is
not at issue in this case.

<fnt5> The offense of terroristic threats in this case
is graded as a M1, and the offense of harassment
in this case is graded as a M3. Using
terroristic threats as the predicate offense, the
trial court graded Appellant's offense of ethnic
intimidation as a F3, which is "one degree
higher in the classification specified in Section
106 ... than the classification of the
other offense." 18 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 2710(b).

<P20>Clifford E. Wilson (Appellant) appeals
from the judgment of sentence imposed
following his non-jury conviction of two
counts of driving under the influence
(DUI) &mdash; controlled substance and one
count of possession of drug paraphernalia.<fnr1>
After careful review, we affirm.

<P20>On July 21, 2021, at approximately 8:50
p.m., Lawrence Wiest (Mr. Wiest), a fire
department paramedic, called 911 to report
a suspected overdose. N.T., 4/27/23, at
19; Criminal Complaint, 12/21/21. Mr. Wiest
reported that a vehicle had crashed
into a fence, and the driver was unconscious.
Criminal Complaint, 12/21/21.
Sharpsburg Borough Police Officer Brett
Carb (Officer Carb) responded to the dispatch.
N.T., 4/27/23, at 6-7.

<B22>The vehicle in question was located
along Main Street and had driven into a
construction fence. Main Street was
busy at that time and location. Video
showed numerous vehicles going past
the scene. The sole occupant, [Appellant],
was unconscious in the driver's
seat. [Mr. Wiest advised Officer Carb
that Appellant displayed agonal breathing,
and that he suspected Appellant had
<Page 661>
overdosed. Criminal Complaint, 12/21/21;
<EMBI>see also</EMBI> Commonwealth's Exhibit 1A.]

<B42>Two (2) doses of Narcan were administered
to [Appellant]. These were given
to him by [Mr. Wiest], a paramedic with
the fire department who was on scene
when Officer Carb arrived. [Mr. Wiest]
indicated that [he] had turned off the
engine and put [Appellant's] vehicle in
park before Officer Carb got there. [Appellant]
regained consciousness after the
second dose [of Narcan].

<B42>[Appellant] told [Officer Carb] that he
had been at the Auto Zone in the neighboring
community of Etna and was going
to his home in Sharpsburg. That
store is a four- or five-minute drive from
where the vehicle was located. [Appellant]
reported no medical conditions that
could have explained the circumstances.
[Appellant] spoke with the paramedics
on scene for several minutes before he
agreed to go to the hospital for treatment.

<B42>Officer Carb observed that [Appellant]
was speaking in a low, raspy voice,
had droopy eyelids, and was unsteady as
he walked from the car to a waiting
stretcher for transport to a local hospital.
Based on his observations, the effect
of the Narcan, and the collision with the
fence, Officer Carb formed the opinion
that [Appellant] was incapable of safely
operating a motor vehicle.

<B42>[Appellant's] car was not legally
parked and was going to be towed from
the scene. After [Appellant] was in the
ambulance and set for transport to the
hospital, Officer Carb conducted an inventory
search of the vehicle prior to
towing it. An empty stamp bag<fnr2> was
recovered in the gear shifter.

<B42>Officer Carb then went to meet [Appellant]
at [the hospital] .... Officer
Carb described [Appellant] as coherent
and responding to questions in an appropriate
manner. [Appellant] was read the
DL-26 [informed consent] form and
signed it after appearing to have no
difficulty understanding Officer Carb.

<B42>[Appellant's] blood was collected and
tested positive for fentanyl.

<P00>Trial Court Opinion, 10/23/23, at 2-3 (unnumbered)
(footnote added).

<P20>The Commonwealth charged Appellant,
via criminal information, with three counts
of DUI &mdash; controlled substances, and one
count each of DUI &mdash; general impairment<fnr3>
and possession of drug paraphernalia.

<P20>On March 3, 2023, Appellant filed an
omnibus pre-trial motion which included,
<EM>inter alia,</EM> a motion to quash the charge of
possession of drug paraphernalia. Appellant
argued he is immune from prosecution
under the Drug Overdose Response Immunity
Act (the Act), 35 P.S. &sect; 780-113.7.
After a hearing, the trial court denied
Appellant's omnibus pre-trial motion. Pertinently,
the court concluded Appellant
was not entitled to immunity under the Act
because Officer Carb discovered the drug
paraphernalia during a standard inventory
search of Appellant's vehicle. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Trial
Court Opinion, 10/23/23, at 4 (unnumbered).

<P20>The case proceeded to a non-jury trial
on June 1, 2023. At the start of trial, the
Commonwealth withdrew the charges of
DUI &mdash; general impairment and DUI &mdash;
controlled substance (combination of alcohol
and drugs). The trial court convicted
Appellant of two counts of DUI &mdash; controlled
substance and one count of possession
<Page 662>
of drug paraphernalia. On the same
date, the trial court sentenced Appellant to
an aggregate of 4 days in the DUI alternative
to jail program and six months' probation,
and imposed $1,000 in fines.

<P20>Appellant filed a timely post-sentence
motion on June 12, 2023, challenging the
sufficiency and weight of the evidence. On
July 18, 2023, the trial court held a hearing
on the post-sentence motion. At the close
of the hearing, the trial court denied Appellant's
motion.

<P20>This timely appeal followed. Appellant
and the trial court have complied with
Pa.R.A.P. 1925.

<P20>Appellant raises the following issue for
review:

<B22>In refusing to quash the charge of possession
of drug paraphernalia, whether
the trial court erred in concluding that
[Appellant] was not entitled to immunity
pursuant to the [Act]?

<P00>Appellant's Brief at 5 (some capitalization
modified).

<P20>Appellant claims he was entitled to immunity
under the Act because Officer Carb
found the drug paraphernalia as a result of
his response to the 911 call. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 22; <EMBI>see
also id.</EMBI> at 23 ("[T]he officer's entry and
search of [Appellant's] car were not wholly
unrelated to [Appellant's] drug overdose
event."). According to Appellant, because
Appellant denied taking any drugs, Officer
Carb had a responsibility to identify the
drugs Appellant had taken. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 23. Appellant
argues Officer Carb found the paraphernalia
while emergency personnel
were still rendering assistance on site. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
at 24.

<P20>The Commonwealth counters that Officer
Carb found the paraphernalia in the
course of an inventory search. Commonwealth
Brief at 14; <EMBI>see also id.</EMBI> (arguing
that Appellant's car was illegally parked
following the accident, and police were required
to tow the vehicle). The Commonwealth
asserts that Appellant was not entitled
to immunity because the inventory
search "was a course of conduct independent
of and separate from the medical
measures taken concerning [Appellant's]
overdose...." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 15. According to the
Commonwealth, "the mere fact that police
were present at the same time that [A]ppellant
was being treated for an overdose
does not equate to an automatic grant of
immunity." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 18.

<P20>Appellant's issue involves the interpretation
and application of the Act.
Our standard of review is well settled:

<B22>A trial court's application of a statute is
a question of law, and our standard of
review is plenary. Moreover, our review
is limited to determining whether the
trial court committed an error of law. In
interpreting any statute, appellate
courts must take note of the principles
of statutory interpretation and construction.
The principal objective of interpreting
a statute is to effectuate the intention
of the legislature and give effect to
all of the provisions of the statute. In
construing a statute to determine its
meaning, courts must first determine
whether the issue may be resolved by
reference to the express language of the
statute, which is to be read according to
the plain meaning of the words. When
analyzing particular words or phrases,
we must construe them according to the
rules of grammar and according to their
common and approved usage. Words of
a statute are to be considered in their
grammatical context. Furthermore, we
may not add provisions that the General
Assembly has omitted unless the phrase
is necessary to the construction of the
statute. A presumption also exists that
the legislature placed every word, sentence
and provision in the statute for
<Page 663>
some purpose and therefore courts must
give effect to every word.

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Lewis,</EMBI> 180 A.3d 786,
788 (Pa. Super. 2018) (citations and quotation
marks omitted).

<P20>The Act was promulgated "[i]n an
effort to prevent overdose deaths," <EMBI>Lewis,</EMBI>
180 A.3d at 787, and provides, in relevant
part:

<B22>(a) A person may not be charged and
shall be immune from prosecution for
any offense listed in subsection (b) and
for a violation of probation or parole if
the person can establish the following:

<B44>(1) law enforcement officers only became
aware of the person's commission
of an offense listed in subsection

<B44>(b) because the person transported a
person experiencing a drug overdose
event<fnr4> to a law enforcement agency, a
campus security office or a health care
facility; or

<B44>(2) all of the following apply:

<B66>(i) the person reported, in good
faith, a drug overdose event to a
law enforcement officer, the 911
system, a campus security officer or
emergency services personnel and
the report was made on the reasonable
belief that another person was
in need of immediate medical attention
and was necessary to prevent
death or serious bodily injury due
to a drug overdose;

<B66>(ii) the person provided his own
name and location and cooperated
with the law enforcement officer,
911 system, campus security officer
or emergency services personnel;
and

<B66>(iii) the person remained with the
person needing immediate medical
attention until a law enforcement
officer, a campus security officer or
emergency services personnel arrived.

<B22>(b) The prohibition on charging or prosecuting
a person as described in subsection
(a) bars charging or prosecuting a
person for probation and parole violations
and for violations of section
13(a)(5), (16), (19), (31), (32), (33) and
(37).

<B22>(c) Persons experiencing drug overdose
events may not be charged and shall be
immune from prosecution as provided in
subsection (b) if a person who transported
or reported and remained with them
may not be charged and is entitled to
immunity under this section.

<B22>(d) The prohibition on charging or prosecuting
a person as described in this
section is <EMB>limited</EMB> in the following respects:

<B44>(1) This section may not bar charging
or prosecuting a person for offenses
enumerated in subsection (b) <EMB>if a law
enforcement officer obtains information
prior to or independent of
the action of seeking or obtaining
emergency assistance</EMB> as described in
subsection (a).

<P00>35 P.S. &sect; 780-113.7(a)-(d)(1) (emphasis and
footnote added; footnote omitted). The Act
"places the burden on the defendant to
establish the Act's applicability." <EMBI>Commonwealth</EMBI>
<Page 664>
<EMBI>v. Markun,</EMBI> 185 A.3d 1026, 1033
(Pa. Super. 2018) (<EM>en banc</EM>).

<P20>In general, the Act provides "immunity
from prosecution for certain crimes
when a person has a reasonable belief
someone is suffering from an overdose and
contacts local authorities." <EMBI>Lewis,</EMBI> 180 A.3d
at 787-88. If the conditions set forth in the
Act are satisfied, immunity may attach to
both the reporter and the victim. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
788.

<P20>Instantly, the parties do not dispute
Mr. Wiest's (the off-duty paramedic who
reported the emergency) entitlement to
immunity under Section 780-113.7(a),
which would give rise to derivative immunity
for Appellant under Section 780-113.7(c).<fnr5>
<EMBI>See Commonwealth v. Carontenuto,</EMBI>
148 A.3d 448, 452-53 (Pa.Super.
2016) (describing immunity for the overdose
victim under subsection (c) as derivative
of the reporter's entitlement to immunity
under subsection (a)). It is also
undisputed that possession of drug paraphernalia
is an enumerated offense under
the Act. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 35 P.S. &sect; 780-113.7(b). Additionally,
the incident was a "drug overdose
event."

<P20>The sole issue is whether the limiting
provision of subsection (d)(1) precludes immunity
for Appellant. Returning to the
text of the Act, subsection (d)(1) limits the
prohibition on charging or prosecuting a
drug overdose victim "if a law enforcement
officer obtains information prior to or <EMB>independent
of</EMB> the action of seeking or obtaining
emergency assistance...." 35 P.S.
&sect; 780-113.7(d)(1) (emphasis added). Contrary
to Appellant's assertion, the plain
language of the Act does not require that
the discovery of the incriminating information
be "wholly unrelated" to the process
of rendering aid in a drug overdose event.<fnr6>
"[W]e should not insert words into [a statute]
that are plainly not there." <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Lehman,</EMBI> ___ Pa. ___, 311 A.3d
1034, 1044 (2024).

<P20>Here, Officer Carb testified he responded
to a dispatch concerning an overdose in
a vehicle. N.T., 4/27/23, at 6-7. When he
arrived on scene, Officer Carb observed
the vehicle had hit a fence. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 7. Mr.
Wiest was still present at the scene. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
Officer Carb identified Appellant as the
vehicle's sole occupant. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 8.

<P20>Officer Carb testified that both he and
Mr. Wiest unsuccessfully attempted to
awaken Appellant. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 9, 19, 21. Mr.
Wiest administered two doses of Narcan to
Appellant. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 9, 20. Officer Carb indicated
that Appellant did not immediately
respond to the Narcan, but he eventually
regained consciousness. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 20.

<P20>Appellant subsequently explained that
he was driving home. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 10. Appellant
indicated that he did not have a history of
losing consciousness or any other medical
conditions. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Officer Carb described Appellant
<Page 665>
as having "slow, raspy speech and
droopy eyes, which are consistent with
narcotics use." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 12; <EMBI>see also id.</EMBI> at 10.
After several minutes of discussion, Appellant
agreed to go to the hospital. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 11.
According to Officer Carb, Appellant was
"very unsteady" while he walked toward
the stretcher. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Officer Carb testified that the vehicle
had to be towed because it was illegally
parked and had crashed into a fence. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
12. Officer Carb stated that standard procedure
is to conduct an inventory search
prior to towing a vehicle. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> During an
inventory search, police "[c]heck the vehicle
for any valuables, anything else, so that
there's no &mdash; nothing alleged taken from
the vehicle." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 12-13. If evidence of a
crime is discovered during the search, the
evidence is transported to the police station,
photographed, and placed in an evidence
locker. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 13.

<P20>Importantly, Officer Carb explained that
the determination to tow Appellant's vehicle
was made <EMB>after</EMB> Appellant agreed to go
to the hospital. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 12. Our review of
Officer Carb's body-worn camera recording
confirms that Appellant was in the
ambulance and under the paramedics' care
before Officer Carb returned to the vehicle
and located the stamp bag. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Commonwealth's
Exhibit 1A (video recording from
Officer Carb's body-worn camera, taken at
the scene); <EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T., 4/27/23, at 8
(wherein the parties stipulated to the authenticity
of the video).

<P20>Officer Carb testified that while conducting
the inventory search, he observed
a stamp bag near the gear shifter. N.T.,
4/27/23, at 13. Officer Carb removed the
stamp bag from the vehicle and "placed it
into evidence[.]" <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 14.

<P20>Appellant relies, in part, on this Court's
decision in <EMBI>Lewis.</EMBI> In <EMBI>Lewis,</EMBI> the defendant
called 911 to report that she had overdosed
on prescription medication. <EMBI>Lewis,</EMBI> 180
A.3d at 788. Police responded to the scene
"to assist [the defendant] until an ambulance
could arrive." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> "While [the police
officer] was assisting [the defendant] in
gathering the prescription pills, he observed
paraphernalia...." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> On direct
appeal, this Court concluded the defendant
was entitled to immunity from prosecution
on the offense of possession of drug paraphernalia.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 791. Appellant specifically
refers to the following portion of this
Court's decision in <EMBI>Lewis</EMBI>:

<B22>[T]he Act is designed to save lives by
sacrificing the enforcement of minor
narcotics criminal penalties. However, as
noted, it does not frustrate larger law
enforcement goals. For example, if a
narcotics distribution operation were the
subject of an extended investigation, the
suspects would not receive immunity if
they called 911 while police were in the
process of entering the building. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 35
P.S. &sect; 780-113.7(d)(1). Furthermore,
even if police were completely unaware
of the narcotics distribution operation,
and were summoned to treat an overdose,
there would be no immunity granted
for distribution charges, firearms
charges, or any other crime not explicitly
listed in the Act. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 35 P.S. &sect; 780-113.7(d)(2).
Thus, the Act in no way constitutes
an impediment to the prosecution
of organized criminal behavior.

<P00><EMBI>Lewis,</EMBI> 180 A.3d at 790. Appellant urges us
to apply <EMBI>Lewis,</EMBI> asserting that Officer
Carb, like the responding officer in <EMBI>Lewis,</EMBI>
found drug paraphernalia only as a result
of his response to a 911 call.

<P20>We conclude <EMBI>Lewis</EMBI> is readily distinguishable.
Significantly, <EMBI>Lewis</EMBI> did not involve
a challenge under subsection (d)(1),
and this Court did not undertake an analysis
of the Act's limiting provision. Instead,
the <EMBI>Lewis</EMBI> decision evaluated the applicability
of the Act's immunity provisions on
individuals who self-report an overdose.
<Page 666>
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 790-91. The <EMBI>Lewis</EMBI> Court also
addressed the reasonableness of the defendant's
belief that she required immediate
medical attention. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 791. Thus, the
facts and arguments present in <EMBI>Lewis</EMBI> exclusively
pertained to subsection (a)(2),
which is not at issue in the present case.

<P20>Moreover, the police officer in <EMBI>Lewis</EMBI>
found drug paraphernalia while he was in
the process of assisting the defendant, before
paramedics arrived on the scene. <EMBI>See
id.</EMBI> at 788. By contrast, Officer Carb discovered
the empty stamp bag <EMB>after</EMB> Appellant
was in the ambulance and under the
care of paramedics.

<P20>On review, we conclude this distinction
is dispositive. Appellant correctly
states that Officer Carb's presence at the
scene was the result of his response to the
911 dispatch. However, Officer Carb did
not immediately observe and seize evidence
as part of his response. Officer Carb
arrived on scene, spoke with Mr. Wiest,
attempted to rouse Appellant (who was
unconscious behind the wheel of a vehicle
that had driven off the road and into a
fence), and oversaw Mr. Wiest's administration
of two doses of Narcan. After an
ambulance arrived, Officer Carb remained
with the vehicle while Mr. Wiest updated
the responding paramedics. Appellant regained
consciousness, and Officer Carb
continued to ask Appellant basic questions
and have a conversation with Appellant
about going to the hospital. Appellant
eventually agreed, walked to the stretcher,
and was loaded into the ambulance.

<P20>Only then did Officer Carb turn
his attention back to the vehicle. Officer
Carb and other responding officers discussed
the vehicle's location and the need
to have it towed. When he returned to the
vehicle, Officer Carb promptly observed
the stamp bag near the vehicle's gear shift.
<EMBI>See generally</EMBI> Commonwealth's Exhibit 1.
Officer Carb proceeded with the inventory
search,<fnr7> and a tow truck arrived on scene
to remove the vehicle. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> The police
department's standard procedure dictates
that an inventory search must be performed
when police determine a vehicle
must be towed, regardless of the reason
for the initial call to the scene.<fnr8>

<P20>We conclude that the inventory search
was a police action independent of Officer
Carb's response to the call for emergency
assistance. Based on the circumstances of
this case, we conclude Officer Carb had
<Page 667>
completed the initial course of action in
rendering emergency assistance before
starting the inventory search. Therefore,
Officer Carb's discovery of drug paraphernalia
during the course of an inventory
search, was "independent of the action of
seeking or obtaining emergency assistance"
for purposes of the Act.

<P20>Based upon the foregoing, we conclude
the limiting provision of subsection (d)(1)
applies; Appellant was not immune from
prosecution on the drug paraphernalia
charge. Thus, Appellant is not entitled to
relief on his claim.

<P20>Judgment of sentence affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt1> 75 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 3802(d)(1) and (d)(2); 35 P.S.
&sect; 780-113(a)(32).

<fnt2> During the pre-trial motion hearing, Officer
Carb testified that a stamp bag is a small
glycine packet, which is commonly used to
package heroin. N.T., 4/27/23, at 13.

<fnt3> 75 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 3802(a)(1), (d)(3).

<fnt4> The Act defines a "drug overdose event" as
follows:

<B22>An acute medical condition, including, but
not limited to, severe physical illness, coma,
mania, hysteria or death, which is the result
of consumption or use of one or more controlled
substances cause an adverse reaction.
A patient's condition shall be deemed
to be a drug overdose if a prudent layperson,
possessing an average knowledge of
medicine and health, would reasonably believe
that the condition is in fact a drug
overdose and requires immediate medical
attention.

<P00>35 P.S. &sect; 780-113.7(f) (definitions section).

<fnt5> Nevertheless, it is clear from the testimony
adduced at the suppression hearing that Mr.
Wiest (1) made a good faith report of a drug
overdose to an appropriate authority; (2) provided
his name and location, and cooperated
with law enforcement and emergency responders;
and (3) remained with Appellant
while paramedics treated him and law enforcement
arrived at the scene.

<fnt6> Our review of caselaw interpreting the Act
reveals only one unpublished memorandum
involving the applicability of subsection (d)(1),
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Ohm,</EMBI> 160 A.3d 265, 922
EDA 2016 (Pa. Super. 2017) (unpublished
memorandum). However, because this
Court's decision in <EMBI>Ohm</EMBI> was issued in 2017,
we may not consider it for persuasive value.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 126(b) (providing unpublished
non-precedential memorandum decisions of
the Superior Court filed <EMB>after</EMB> May 1, 2019,
may be cited for their persuasive value). Even
if we could consider the <EMBI>Ohm</EMBI> decision, it
would be of little assistance, as there was
little admissible evidence in the record of that
case to aid in review.

<fnt7> Appellant does not dispute that police were
authorized to tow his vehicle from the scene,
nor does he argue Officer Carb violated proper
inventory search procedures. <EMBI>See generally
Commonwealth v. Lagenella,</EMBI> 623 Pa. 434, 83
A.3d 94, 102 (2013) ("An inventory search of
an automobile is permissible when (1) the
police have lawfully impounded the vehicle;
and (2) the police have acted in accordance
with a reasonable, standard policy of routinely
securing and inventorying the contents of
the impounded vehicle.").

<fnt8> We note that in the context of the exclusionary
rule, Pennsylvania law permits introduction
of evidence obtained through a valid
inventory search, as well as improperly obtained
evidence that would have inevitably
been discovered through a valid inventory
search. <EMBI>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Thompson,</EMBI>
289 A.3d 1104, 1107-10 (Pa. Super.
2023) (noting that a proper inventory search
is an exception to the warrant requirement,
and concluding an inventory search of the
defendant's vehicle was proper where the officer
testified the vehicle must be towed
based on its obstruction of a commercial
business); <EMBI>Commonwealth v. King,</EMBI> 259 A.3d
511, 522-23 (Pa. Super. 2021) (concluding
that even if the challenged evidence was unlawfully
obtained, it would have been discovered
during a valid inventory search, where
the defendant's vehicle was illegally parked
and had to be towed). Though neither the
warrant requirement nor the doctrine of inevitable
discovery is directly at issue in this
case, caselaw in this area supports our conclusion
that an inventory search constitutes
an independent police action.

[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <author>BENDER</author>, <dgn>P.J.E.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Appellant, Tyler Thomas Adams, appeals
from the aggregate judgment of sentence
of 2 to 6 years' incarceration, imposed
after he pled guilty to aggravated
assault, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2702(a)(4), carrying a
firearm without a license, 18 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 6106(a)(1), and criminal conspiracy to
commit robbery, 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 903. On appeal,
Appellant contends that the trial
court erred by denying his two motions to
dismiss under Pa.R.Crim.P. 600. After
careful review, we affirm.

<P20>The facts underlying Appellant's convictions
are not germane to our disposition of
his appeal. We need only note that a criminal
complaint was filed on October 30,
2020, in case CP-49-CR-0000154-2021
(hereinafter "case 154"), charging Appellant
with various offenses including robbery
and conspiracy to commit robbery.<fnr1>
In case CP-49-CR-0000156-2021 (hereinafter
"case 156"), a criminal complaint was
filed on January 14, 2021, charging Appellant
with offenses including aggravated assault,
possession of a firearm by a person
prohibited, and carrying a firearm without
a license.

<P20>Appellant's cases were consolidated. On
April 11, 2022, Appellant filed a Rule 600
motion to dismiss both cases, which the
court denied on July 12, 2022. Appellant
filed a second motion to dismiss his cases
on May 3, 2023, which the court again
denied on August 3, 2023. Ultimately, on
December 4, 2023, Appellant pled guilty to
aggravated assault, carrying a firearm
without a license, and criminal conspiracy
to commit robbery. On February 1, 2024,
he was sentenced to the aggregate term
set forth <EM>supra.</EM>

<P20>Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal
on February 22, 2024.<fnr2> Although it does
not appear that the court ordered him to
file a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise statement
of errors complained of on appeal, Appellant
filed a statement on March 18, 2024.
On May 13, 2024, the trial court issued a
"Statement in Lieu of Opinion" concluding
that Appellant's Rule 600 issues are
waived but, alternatively, it is relying on
<Page 669>
the rationale set forth in its July 12, 2022
order denying his motion to dismiss.

<P20>Herein, Appellant states two issues for
our review:

<B22>Question 1: Did the [trial c]ourt abuse
its discretion when it denied Appellant's
Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 600
without [a] hearing or any evidence being
presented?

<B22>Question 2: Did the [trial c]ourt abuse
its discretion when it denied Appellant's
Motion to Dismiss pursuant to Rule 600
where the Commonwealth failed to act
with due diligence in bringing Appellant
to trial within the time limit required by
Rule 600?

<P00>Appellant's Brief at 8 (unnumbered).<fnr3>

<P20>Before we address Appellant's
Rule 600 claims, we discuss the trial
court's determination that he waived these
issues because he "entered a plea and was
sentenced[,]" and he "did not reserve the
right to appeal the Rule 600 issue as part
of the plea agreement or at the time of his
plea or sentence." Statement in Lieu of
Opinion, 5/13/24, at 2 (unnumbered). As
stated above, Appellant filed his motions to
dismiss under Rule 600 in April of 2022
and May of 2023, both of which were denied.
He then pled guilty on December 4,
2023.

<B22>Generally, "upon entry of a guilty plea, a
defendant waives all claims and defenses
other than those sounding in the jurisdiction
of the court, the validity of the
plea, and what has been termed the
`legality' of the sentence imposed[.]"
[<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Eisenberg,</EMBI> 98 A.3d
1268,] 1275 [(Pa. 2014)] (citation omitted).
A guilty plea, however, does not
always extinguish all claims outside of
these three categories. In <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Singleton,</EMBI> 169 A.3d 79 (Pa.
Super. 2017), this Court recognized that
defendants may enter a guilty plea conditioned
on the preservation for appeal
of issues outside of these categories.
[<EMBI>Id.</EMBI>] at 81-82 (stating that[,] "[w]hile our
courts have not specifically addressed
the validity of conditional plea agreements,
our courts have proceeded to review
the merits of issues specifically reserved
in plea agreements" [)](citations
omitted)[]. Therefore, an issue may be
properly preserved for appeal, despite
entry of a guilty plea, if a defendant
raised that issue prior to entering a
guilty plea <EMBI>and specifically reserved
the right to seek appellate review of
that issue as part of the plea agreement.
See id.</EMBI>; <EMBI>accord Eisenberg,</EMBI> 98
A.3d at 1274-75 (concluding that the defendant
"adequately preserved his
[]claim for [Pa.R.A.P.] 302 purposes at
the plea hearing"). In reviewing the
terms of a plea agreement, we approach
the plea agreement as a contract, "to be
analyzed under contract-law standards."
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Snook,</EMBI> 230 A.3d 438,
444 (Pa. Super. 2020). In a dispute over
the terms of a plea agreement, "[a]ny
ambiguities ... will be construed
against the Government." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Speed,</EMBI> 323 A.3d 850,
2024 PA Super 206, *2 (2024) (emphasis
added).

<P20>In <EMBI>Eisenberg,</EMBI> our Supreme Court held
that, although Eisenberg pled guilty, he
had preserved a claim that a mandatory
fine for one of his offenses was unconstitutionally
excessive. The Court pointed to
the fact that, at the plea hearing, Eisenberg's
"[c]ounsel specifically referenced
<Page 670>
the Cruel Punishments Clause of Article 1,
Section 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution,"
"articulated an objection sounding in
terms of disproportionality and excessiveness,"
and "labeled the fine `draconian[.]'"
<EMBI>Eisenberg,</EMBI> 98 A.3d at 1275. Additionally,
the Court noted that "the trial court plainly
understood the gravamen of the claim,"
and "conveyed at the outset of its remarks,
... that the constitutional issue would ultimately
not be resolved in that trial courtroom."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Similarly, in <EMBI>Speed,</EMBI> this Court concluded
that Speed's Rule 600 claim was not
waived even though he pled guilty. We
relied on the fact that, at Speed's guilty
plea proceeding, he "and the Commonwealth
disagreed on whether the terms of
the plea agreement prevented [Speed]
from raising a Rule 600 claim on appeal[,]"
and the trial court specifically concluded
that the "plea agreement [did] <EMBI>not</EMBI> preclude"
Speed from doing so. <EMBI>Speed, supra</EMBI>
at *2, (emphasis added). The <EMBI>Speed</EMBI> panel
also noted that, "[a]fter the trial court
made clear that it considered [Speed's]
Rule 600 appeal rights to be preserved in
his offer to plead guilty, the Commonwealth
did not withdraw from its plea
agreement with [Speed]." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Therefore,
we found that Speed could raise his Rule
600 issue on appeal. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>We cannot reach the same conclusion in
the instant case. At Appellant's plea proceeding,
the Commonwealth stated the offenses
to which Appellant was pleading
guilty, and then declared:

<B22>[The Commonwealth]: Your Honor, the
terms of the plea agreement are that
... the [sentences for Appellant's]
charges are to be run concurrent to his
current incarceration sentence in Union
County, and that the sentence is to be
within the standard range. All other remaining
charges and counts shall be dismissed
and those are the terms of the
plea agreement, [Y]our Honor.

<P00>N.T. Plea, 12/4/23, at 2-3. Defense counsel
stated, "That's correct, [Y]our Honor." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
at 3. At no point did defense counsel, or
Appellant during his oral colloquy, mention
Rule 600 or indicate that Appellant wished
to preserve for appeal a challenge to the
court's denial of his Rule 600 motions to
dismiss. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 3-7.

<P20>Similarly, at Appellant's sentencing proceeding,
there was also no mention of any
Rule 600 issue. There, the court restated
the terms of Appellant's plea consistently
with the Commonwealth's recitation, quoted
<EM>supra.</EM> <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T. Sentencing, 2/1/24, at 7.
Afterward, Appellant's counsel said he had
"[n]othing further[,]" <EMBI>id.,</EMBI> and when the
court asked Appellant if there was "anything
[he] would like to tell the [c]ourt
before [it] impose[d his] sentences[,]" Appellant
replied, "No, sir." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 8.

<P20>Unlike in <EMBI>Eisenberg</EMBI> and <EMBI>Speed,</EMBI> there
was no mention of any Rule 600 issue at
Appellant's plea proceeding or sentencing
hearing that would indicate this issue was
preserved, nor anything to even suggest
ambiguity in this regard. Therefore, we
agree with the trial court that by pleading
guilty, Appellant waived his challenge to
the court's denial of his motions to dismiss
under Rule 600.

<P20>Judgment of sentence affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt1> Appellant states that the complaint in case
154 was filed on October 28, 2020. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Appellant's
Brief at 9 (unnumbered). However, the
date on the first page of the criminal complaint
contained in the certified record bears
a filing date of October 30, 2020.

<fnt2> Initially, Appellant filed a single notice of
appeal listing the docket numbers for both his
cases in violation of <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Walker,</EMBI>
646 Pa. 456, 185 A.3d 969 (2018) (requiring
appellants to file separate notices of appeal
when single order resolves issues arising
on more than one lower court docket). In
light of <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Young,</EMBI> 280 A.3d
1049, 1057 (Pa. Super. 2022) (holding when
there is <EMBI>Walker</EMBI> defect in appeal to which
Pa.R.A.P. 902 applies, default position is to
allow correction of defect unless good cause
is shown by opposing party), we directed Appellant
to file amended notices of appeal. He
timely complied, and we consolidated his appeals
<EM>sua sponte</EM> on April 23, 2024.

<fnt3> Appellant does not delineate these two issues
as separate claims in the Argument section
of his brief, as required by Pa.R.A.P.
2119(a) ("The argument shall be divided into
as many parts as there are questions to be
argued; and shall have at the head of each
part&mdash;in distinctive type or in type distinctively
displayed&mdash;the particular point treated therein,
followed by such discussion and citation of
authorities as are deemed pertinent."). Nevertheless,
our review is not meaningfully impacted
by this briefing error.

counsel permission to withdraw.

<P20>Before we turn to a review of Blango's
appeal, we note with extreme displeasure
the Commonwealth's failure to file an appellee's
brief. "An appellee is required to
file a brief that at minimum must contain
`a summary of argument and the complete
argument for appellee.'" <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Pappas,</EMBI> 845 A.2d 829, 835 (Pa. Super.
2004) (quoting Pa.R.A.P. 2112). In <EMBI>Pappas,</EMBI>
the panel referred to the Commonwealth's
failure to file a proper appellee's brief as
"unacceptable." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> We echo that opinion
and remind the Commonwealth of its obligation
to file an appellee's brief in future
appeals.

<P20>In this case, following a jury trial in
2004, Blango was found guilty of a variety
of sex offenses committed against Blango's
minor stepdaughter. After ordering a presentence
report and Megan's Law assessment,
the trial court sentenced Blango to
an aggregate term of 6&frac12; to 20 years'
incarceration, followed by an aggregate
consecutive probationary term of 15 years.
Following post-sentence motions, the court
entered a modified sentencing order, in
which it imposed the following specific conditions
of probation:

<B24>&mdash; Defendant shall maintain/obtain full-time
employment

<B24>&mdash; Have an MH/MR evaluation and undergo
individual counseling if recommended

<B24>&mdash; Undergo sex offender evaluation

<B24>&mdash; Attend group counseling at a sex offender
counseling service such as
T.W. Ponessa Associates

<B24>&mdash; Undergo medical evaluation and receive
pharmacologic treatment as
recommended

<B24>&mdash; Undergo psychiatric treatment when
required

<B24>&mdash; Undergo maintenance polygraphs
during his entire period of parole

<B24>&mdash; STD class

<B24>&mdash; Community service

<B24>&mdash; No contact with the victim, [] her
sister, or his ex-wife, Iris, or any
other family members.

<P00><EMBI>See</EMBI> Sentencing Order, 2/18/04, at 2. Finally,
the court requested that the Pennsylvania
Board of Probation and Parole ("the
Board") supervise Blango as a special parolee
<Page 674>
and probationer upon his release
from state prison. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Request For Special
Probation/Parole Supervision, 2/24/04; <EMBI>see
also</EMBI> Request For Special Probation/Parole
Supervision, 5/17/04.

<P20>In August 2023, a notice of alleged violations
of probation was filed, followed by a
request for a revocation hearing. At the
time, Blango had already maxed out his
incarceration term of his sentence and was
serving a five-year probationary sentence
for counts 14 through 16.<fnr1> The notice indicates
that the current probationary term
was from February 3, 2023 through February
3, 2028. The notice further indicated
that Blango was accused of committing the
following violations:

<B42><EMB>Condition#8: No contact with Michael
Thompson, Natasha Wansley,
Brianna Thompson, Lyric Thompson,
Jaylen Thompson or Branden Thompson
including messages, letters, presents,
email, or verbal communication.
You are also to maintain a 500 ft
distance from 2644 N. Hollywood St,
Philadelphia:</EMB>

<B42>7/17/23-Michael Thomson informed
parole staff that the offender sent text
messages to his minor child, and provided
screenshots of these to parole staff.
He also reported that they have witnessed
the offender outside of 2644 N.
Hollywood St, Philadelphia.

<B42><EMB>Condition # 8 (Special Probation) &mdash;
No contact with anyone under the age
of 18 without permission from Probation/Parole
staff:</EMB>

<B42>7/17/23&mdash;The offender sent text messages
to a minor child. Screenshots of
these were sent to his Parole Agent.

<P00>Notice of Alleged Violations of Probation/Parole/Intermediate
Punishment,
8/9/23.

<P20>A revocation hearing was held on October
23, 2023. Probation Officer Curtis
Stockdale testified that Blango was living
in Philadelphia while being supervised. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
N.T., Revocation Hearing, 10/23/23, at 3.
Officer Stockdale stated Blango had contact
with the victim's family from the original
case and sent text messages to a minor
child, in violation of his probation. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI>
Screenshots of the text messages were
provided to Blango's state parole agent.
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI>

<P20>John Lorenz, a state parole agent, stated
that Blango had previously been taken
into custody on three separate occasions
during parole supervision for violations related
to contacting the same children, making
the instant offense the fourth violation
in total. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 3-4. Upon learning of
this information, Officer Stockdale explained
that he was changing his original
recommendation of additional state probation
to a request for a period of incarceration.
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 4. Agent Lorenz also recommended
a revocation with a period of
incarceration. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI>

<P20>Officer Stockdale explained that Blango
had signed written instructions on February
10, 2022, outlining the specific rules of
no contact with the family in question,
which stated "all their names, to not be
within 500 feet of their residence, and also
to have no contact with anyone under the
age of 18." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 7. Based on the above,
the court revoked Blango's probation on
counts 14 through 16 and resentenced him
to a period of incarceration of 1 to 2 years.
<Page 675>

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> All other counts remained the same. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
This timely appeal followed.

<P20>We turn first to counsel's petition
to withdraw. To withdraw pursuant to <EMBI>Anders,</EMBI>
counsel must:

<B22>1) petition the court for leave to withdraw
stating that, after making a conscientious
examination of the record, counsel
has determined that the appeal
would be frivolous; 2) furnish a copy of
the [<EMBI>Anders</EMBI>] brief to the [appellant]; and
3) advise the [appellant] that he or she
has the right to retain private counsel or
raise additional arguments that the [appellant]
deems worthy of the court's attention.

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Cartrette,</EMBI> 83 A.3d
1030, 1032 (Pa. Super. 2013) (<EM>en banc</EM>)
(citation omitted). With respect to the
third requirement of <EMBI>Anders,</EMBI> that counsel
inform the appellant of his or her rights in
light of counsel's withdrawal, this Court
has held that counsel must "attach to their
petition to withdraw a copy of the letter
sent to their client advising him or her of
their rights." <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Millisock,</EMBI>
873 A.2d 748, 752 (Pa. Super. 2005).

<P20>An <EMBI>Anders</EMBI> brief must comply
with the following requirements:

<B22>(1) provide a summary of the procedural
history and facts, with citations to the
record; (2) refer to anything in the record
that counsel believes arguably supports
the appeal; (3) set forth counsel's
conclusion that the appeal is frivolous;
and (4) state counsel's reasons for concluding
that the appeal is frivolous.
Counsel should articulate the relevant
facts of record, controlling case law,
and/or statutes on point that have led to
the conclusion that the appeal is frivolous.

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Santiago,</EMBI> 602 Pa. 159,
978 A.2d 349, 361 (2009). "[I]f counsel's
petition and brief satisfy <EMBI>Anders,</EMBI> we will
then undertake our own review of the appeal
to determine if it is wholly frivolous."
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Wrecks,</EMBI> 931 A.2d 717,
721 (Pa. Super. 2007) (brackets added, citation
omitted).

<P20>We find counsel has substantially
complied with the preliminary requirements
set forth in <EMBI>Anders.</EMBI> Counsel filed a
petition to withdraw, certifying he has reviewed
the case and determined that Blango's
appeal is frivolous. Counsel also filed a
brief, which includes a summary of the
history and facts of the case, potential
issues that could be raised by Blango, and
his assessment of why those issues are
meritless, with citations to relevant legal
authority. While a copy of the letter sent
to Blango advising him of his rights is not
attached to the petition to withdraw, counsel
did attach a copy of the letter to his
<EMBI>Anders</EMBI> brief, filed on the same date. The
letter informs Blango that counsel reviewed
the record, found the appeal wholly
frivolous, and advised Blango that he has
the right to retain new counsel in pursuit
of his appeal or proceed <EM>pro se</EM> and that he
has the right to submit any additional issues
he believes are meritorious.

<P20>Counsel has therefore substantially complied
with the requirements of <EMBI>Anders.</EMBI>
Blango has not filed a response. We therefore
proceed to review the issues outlined
in the <EMBI>Anders</EMBI> brief, which present potential
challenges to the revocation of probation
and the sentence imposed after revocation.

<P20>The "[r]evocation of a probation
sentence is a matter committed to the
sound discretion of the trial court and that
court's decision will not be disturbed on
appeal in the absence of an error of law or
an abuse of discretion." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Perreault,</EMBI> 930 A.2d 553, 558 (Pa. Super.
2007). Our review of a revocation proceeding
is limited to determining the validity of
the proceeding, the legality of the judgment
<Page 676>
of sentence imposed, and the discretionary
aspects of sentencing. <EMBI>See Commonwealth
v. Cartrette,</EMBI> 83 A.3d at 1033-35.

<P20>"The Commonwealth establishes a
probation violation meriting revocation
when it shows, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the probationer's conduct
violated the terms and conditions of his
probation, and that probation has proven
an ineffective rehabilitation tool incapable
of deterring probationer from future antisocial
conduct." <EMBI>Perreault,</EMBI> 930 A.2d at 558
(citation omitted).

<P20>In his 1925(b) concise statement, Blango
argued the trial court erred in revoking his
probation when the violated condition was
invalid because it was imposed solely by
state probation and not the court at the
time of sentencing. Blango further argues
the record does not demonstrate the condition
is germane and related to a court-imposed
condition.

<P20>Our Supreme Court has distinguished
between "conditions of probation," which
are imposed by a trial court, and "conditions
of supervision," which are imposed
by the Board and its agents. <EMBI>See Commonwealth
v. Shires,</EMBI> 240 A.3d 974, 977 (Pa.
Super. 2020) (citation omitted).

<P20>In <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Foster,</EMBI> 654 Pa.
266, 214 A.3d 1240 (2019), our Supreme
Court held the statutory language under
Section 9754 must be strictly construed to
require all specific conditions of probation
to be enumerated at the time of sentencing,
holding:

<B22>We find the language of the pertinent
statutory provisions to be clear and unambiguous.
The law provides a general
condition of probation &mdash; that the defendant
lead "a law-abiding life," i.e., that
the defendant refrain from committing
another crime. To [e]nsure that general
condition is met, or to assist the defendant
in meeting that general condition,
the order must also include certain "specific
conditions" from the list enumerated
in section 9754(c). Only upon the
violation of any of the "specified conditions"
in the probation order (general or
specific) may a court revoke the defendant's
probation. In other words, a court
may find a defendant in violation of probation
only if the defendant has violated
one of the "specific conditions" of probation
included in the probation order or
has committed a new crime. The plain
language of the statute does not allow
for any other result.

<P00><EMBI>Foster,</EMBI> 214 A.3d at 1250.

<P20>"In <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Elliott</EMBI> [616 Pa.
524], 50 A.3d 1284 (Pa. 2012), ... our
Supreme Court analyzed the interplay between
the Board's regulatory authority set
forth in the Prison and Parole Code, specifically
61 Pa.C.S.A. &sect;&sect; 6131 and 6151, and
the trial court's authority to impose a sentence
as set forth in 42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect;&sect; 9751,
9754 and 9771." <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Smith,</EMBI>
325 A.3d 794 (Pa. Super. filed Oct. 1, 2024).
The <EMBI>Elliott</EMBI> Court explained:

<B22>[T]he Board and its agents may impose
conditions of supervision that are germane
to, elaborate on, or interpret any
conditions of probation that are imposed
by the trial court. This interpretation
gives meaning to all of the statutory
provisions relevant to this case and thus:
(1) maintains the sentencing authority
solely with a trial court; (2) permits the
Board and its agents to evaluate probationers
on a one-on-one basis to effectuate
supervisions; (3) sustains the ability
of the Board to impose conditions of
supervision; and (4) authorizes that a
probationer may be detained, arrested,
and "violated" for failing to comply with
either a condition of probation or conditions
of supervision. In summary, a trial
<Page 677>
court may impose conditions of probation
in a generalized manner, and the
Board or its agents may impose more
specific conditions of supervision pertaining
to that probation, so long as
those supervision conditions are in furtherance
of the trial court's conditions of
probation.

<P00><EMBI>Elliott,</EMBI> 50 A.3d at 1292.<fnr2>

<P20>The trial court addressed Blango's arguments
as follows:

<B22>Whether the sentencing court placed
these conditions on the record at sentencing
is unclear. However, his state
parole agent had authority to provide
him with conditions of supervision, including
the conditions he violated herein,
as well as violated while on state parole
supervision. Additionally, his county probation
officer informed him of these
same no contact conditions. All of these
efforts complied with 42 Pa.C.S.A. sections
9754 and 9771, as well as our Supreme
Court's decisions[].

<B42>Here, the evidence presented at the
time of the revocation hearing established
that [Blango] was aware of the
conditions that he was accused of violating;
i.e., that he was to have no contact
with the family in question, that he was
not to be within 500 feet of their residence,
and also not to have contact with
anyone under the age of 18. While [Blango]
argues that the record does not demonstrate
that the conditions he is said to
have violated are germane to a court-imposed
condition, this argument lacks
merit. [Blango] was found guilty of three
counts of indecent assault of a person
under 13 years of age and those were
the counts at which his probation was
revoked. Because not having contact
with the victim, or the victim's family, as
well as not having contact with anyone
under the age of 18, would be inherent
to the conditions of his probation, we fail
to see how those conditions would not be
germane. Further, [Blango] acknowledged
the conditions by signing the February
10, 2022 specific rules involving no
contact and, accordingly, cannot argue
that he was not aware of the conditions
being imposed.

<P00>Trial Court Opinion, 2/6/24, at 3-4.

<P20>Upon review, we conclude the
Commonwealth established by a preponderance
of the evidence that Blango violated
the terms of his probation. We agree
with the trial court that the probation department
had authority to provide Blango
with conditions of supervision. However,
this authority is not unfettered. Instead,
the authority of the probation department
to impose a condition of supervision was
limited by the conditions of probation imposed
by the trial court. <EMBI>See Elliott,</EMBI> 50
A.3d at 1288; <EMBI>see also Shires,</EMBI> 240 A.3d at
977. Such conditions must be "germane to,
elaborate on, or interpret any conditions of
probation that are imposed by the trial
court." <EMBI>See Elliott,</EMBI> 50 A.3d at 1291-92;
<EMBI>Shires</EMBI> 240 A.3d at 978.

<P20>The record is devoid of a transcript from
the original sentencing hearing. Accordingly,
it is unclear whether the court placed
certain conditions of supervision on the
record at the time of sentencing. However,
the trial court imposed certain conditions
of parole/probation with which Blango was
required to comply and informed him of
these requirements by way of its sentencing
order. In its February 2, 2004 sentencing
<Page 678>
order, the court specified that upon his
release, Blango was to have "[n]o contact
with the victim, [], her sister, or his ex-wife,
[] or any other family members."
Order, 2/2/04, at 1. In a February 18, 2004
order in which the court modified its sentence,
the court again specified the exact
same condition. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Order, 2/18/04, at 2.

<P20>Blango was accused of violating a
condition of supervision that prevented
him from contact with six named individuals.
It is clear from the testimony provided
at the revocation hearing that these
named individuals are Blango's family
members. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., Revocation Hearing,
10/23/23, at 3, 6-7. As the sentencing order
established a condition of probation that
prohibited contact with "any other family
members," the probation department's
condition of supervision that specified certain
family members with which Blango
was prevented from having contact was
clearly "germane to" "elaborate[d] on" and
"interpret[ed]" the original condition of
probation established by the trial court.

<P20>Finally, the evidence presented at
the revocation hearing established that
Blango was aware of the conditions he was
accused of violating. His state parole agent
had authority to provide Blango with conditions
of supervision including the conditions
he violated over the four separate
occasions. Blango's county probation officer
informed Blango of these no contact
conditions and Blango acknowledged notice
of these conditions by signing written
instructions on February 10, 2022, outlining
the specific rules of no contact with the
family in question. Accordingly, we conclude
the trial court did not err in finding
a probation violation occurred.

<P20>Next, counsel identifies potential
sentencing issues regarding the court's imposition
of a term of incarceration of 1 to 2
years. Regarding a challenge to the discretionary
aspects of a probation-revocation
sentence, we have stated:

<B22>An appellant wishing to appeal the discretionary
aspects of a probation-revocation
sentence has no absolute right to do
so but, rather, must petition this Court
for permission to do so. Before this
Court can address such a discretionary
challenge, an appellant must invoke this
Court's jurisdiction by establishing that
(1) the appeal was timely filed; (2) the
challenge was properly preserved by objecting
during the revocation sentencing
or in a post-sentence motion; (3) his or
her brief includes a concise statement of
the reasons relied upon for allowance of
appeal of the discretionary aspects of
the sentence pursuant to Pa.R.A.P.
2119(f); and (4) the concise statement
raises a substantial question that the
sentence is inappropriate under the Sentencing
Code.

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Starr,</EMBI> 234 A.3d 755,
759 (Pa. Super. 2020) (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted). As noted
above, Blango timely appealed. While
counsel omitted a Rule 2119(f) statement,
this does not preclude our review of this
issue in an <EMBI>Anders</EMBI> context. <EMBI>See Commonwealth.
v. Zeigler,</EMBI> 112 A.3d 656, 661 (Pa.
Super. 2015). However, counsel notes
Blango waived any discretionary sentencing
challenge because he failed to file any
post-sentence motion challenging the discretionary
aspects of his sentence. <EMBI>See Anders</EMBI>
Brief, at 20. Further, Blango did not
object to his sentence at the revocation
hearing. Our review of the record confirms
Blango has failed to preserve his challenge
to the discretionary aspects of sentencing.
Accordingly, he cannot invoke this Court's
jurisdiction over this issue. <EMBI>See Starr,</EMBI> 234
A.3d at 759.

<P20>Even if a challenge to the discretionary
aspects of sentence were preserved,
we would find the trial court did
<Page 679>
not abuse its discretion in finding that
Blango required a sentence of total confinement.

<P20>Once the court concludes a violation occurred
and probation was not effective, the
court may resentence the defendant to a
total term of incarceration if: (1) the defendant
was convicted of a new crime; (2) the
defendant's conduct makes it likely that he
or she will commit a new crime if not
incarcerated; or (3) incarceration "is essential
to vindicate the authority of the court."
42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9771(c); <EMBI>Foster,</EMBI> 214 A.3d at
1251.

<P20>It was uncontested at the revocation
hearing that the instant violation was
Blango's fourth violation while being supervised.
Based on a clear pattern of continued
violations, the court was within its
authority to impose an incarceration sentence
to vindicate its authority. <EMBI>See Commonwealth
v. McAfee,</EMBI> 849 A.2d 270, 277
(Pa. Super. 2004) (stating total confinement
may be necessary to vindicate the
authority of the court where a defendant
demonstrates a "lack of willingness to comply
with ... multiple court orders entered
in [his] case.").

<P20>We conclude the issues identified in this
appeal are frivolous, and our independent
review of the record reveals no additional
issues of arguable merit. Accordingly, we
grant counsel's petition to withdraw and
affirm the judgment of sentence.

<P20>Petition to withdraw granted. Judgment
of sentence affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt*> Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior
Court.

<fnt1> We note it is unclear from the record when
Blango was originally released from incarceration.
It is asserted in certain filings that
Blango maxed out the full twenty years of his
sentence in state prison. However, it is also
asserted that he was on parole at some point
prior to switching to probation. This would
only be possible if Blango were released from
prison prior to the full 20-year term. As it is
undisputed that Blango was on probation at
the time of the alleged violation, this discrepancy
does not affect our disposition.

<fnt2> The defendant in <EMBI>Elliott</EMBI> also was placed on
special probation. However, similar to the
case at hand, the condition alleged to have
been violated was not among the enumerated
special conditions imposed by operation of
law pertaining to special probation. In both
cases, the condition alleged to have been violated
was a specific condition of probation
imposed by the trial court.

[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <author>COLINS</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>E.W. ("Appellant"), on behalf of her seven-year-old
daughter, A.W., appeals from
the order denying her petition for a sexual
violence protection order ("SVPO") against
Appellee, E.N., pursuant to the Protection
of Victims of Sexual Violence or Intimidation
Act ("the Act"), 42 Pa.C.S.
&sect;&sect; 62A01-62A20. We affirm.

<P20>Appellant filed her petition on May 5,
2023 alleging that, on April 19, 2023, E.N.,
who is the same age as A.W. and was her
first-grade classmate, reached down A.W.'s
pants and touched A.W.'s genitals, despite
the latter girl's request that E.N. stop
what she was doing. SVPO Petition, 5/5/23,
at 2; <EMBI>see</EMBI> 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 62A05(a) (providing
that a parent may file a petition on behalf
of a minor child). According to the petition,
the incident occurred during a rehearsal
for the school's spring concert at the high
school and A.W. suffered a scratch on her
labia majora. SVPO Petition, 5/5/23, at 2.
The petition further alleged that, on the
bus ride back to the elementary school,
E.N. touched A.W.'s buttocks and forced
A.W. to touch her own. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> After an <EM>ex
parte</EM> hearing that same day, the trial
court issued a temporary SVPO prohibiting
E.N., <EM>inter alia,</EM> from having any contact
with A.W. with any violation of the
order resulting in E.N.'s potential arrest
for indirect criminal contempt, imprisonment
for up to six months, and a fine.
Temporary SVPO, 5/5/23; <EMBI>see</EMBI> 42 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 62A06(b) (providing that trial court may
conduct an <EM>ex parte</EM> hearing and issue a
temporary order under the Act to protect
the petitioner from "an immediate and
present danger").
<Page 683>

<P20>Hearings were held on the petition before
the Honorable Andrea Marceca
Strong on June 2, 5, 9, and 20, 2023. At the
hearings, testimony was taken from Appellant;
A.W.'s father; the York County Children's
Advocacy Center employee who
conducted a forensic interview of A.W.; the
supervisor of the nurse who conducted a
"SAFE" forensic examination of A.W., who
testified as an expert in forensic examination;
and A.W.'s psychiatrist, who testified
as an expert in child and adolescent psychiatry.
The trial court also conducted an
<EM>in camera</EM> examination of A.W.

<P20>At the conclusion of the June 20, 2023
hearing, the trial court announced its findings
and its conclusion that E.W. had not
met her burden under the Act. On that
same date, the court entered an order
denying E.W.'s petition for an SVPO
against E.N. Appellant filed a timely appeal,
and a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise statement
of errors complained of on appeal, as
directed by the trial court. The trial court
then filed an opinion pursuant to Rule
1925(a) in which it expanded upon its
grounds for denial of the petition.

<P20>Appellant raises the following issues on
appeal:

<B22>I. Whether the trial court erred as a
matter of law and/or abused its discretion
in refusing to enter a protection
order where Appellant presented sufficient
evidence that minor A.W. was the
victim of sexual violence?

<B22>II. Whether the trial court erred as a
matter of law and/or abused its discretion
in making findings that are not
supported by the record and at times
are inconsistent?

<B22>III. Whether the trial court erred as a
matter of law and/or abused its discretion
in holding a bias against the Appellant
for the mere fact that, as a party to
this action, Appellant remained in the
courtroom?

<B22>IV. Whether the trial court erred as a
matter of law in holding that evidence
admissible pursuant to a hearsay exception
would not be considered for the
truth of the matter asserted?

<B22>V. Whether the trial court erred as a
matter of law in finding that mailing the
notice pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.[] &sect; 5985.1
was insufficient and did not constitute
proper notice?

<P00>Appellant's Brief at 4-5 (unnecessary capitalization,
suggested answers, and footnotes
omitted).

<P20>Prior to addressing these appellate arguments,
we must address two preliminary
matters. In the first of these matters, we
consider whether to strike the Appellee's
brief that E.N.'s mother, N.O., who is not
an attorney, filed in this Court on behalf of
her daughter. Appellant filed an application
to strike, which was referred to the
panel deciding the merits of the appeal.
Application to Strike, 12/6/23; Order,
1/10/24.

<P20>At the initial hearing on the SVPO petition,
the trial court appointed a guardian
<EM>ad litem</EM> ("GAL") to represent E.N. and
continued the matter, "strongly encourag[ing]"
N.O. to retain counsel for her
daughter. Order, 6/2/23; N.T., 6/2/23, at 21-24;
<EMBI>see</EMBI> Pa.R.Civ.P. 2031(b) ("If a minor
party to an action is not represented, the
court shall appoint a guardian for the minor
either upon its own motion or upon []
petition[.]"); 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 62A06(a.1) (providing
that respondent in a proceeding under
the Act must be advised of her right to
legal representation, but she has no right
to court-appointed counsel); <EMBI>see also Varner
v. Holley,</EMBI> 854 A.2d 520, 523 (Pa. Super.
2004) (a minor named as a defendant
in a Protection From Abuse ("PFA") Act
proceeding must be represented by a
guardian). After further discussion on
E.N.'s need for counsel at the second hearing,
<Page 684>
the trial court appointed an attorney
at N.O's expense and continued the matter
a second time. N.T., 6/5/23, at 14-16; Order,
6/5/23. GAL and counsel continued to
represent E.N. through the remainder of
the proceeding.

<P20>After announcing its ruling denying the
SVPO petition, the court vacated the appointment
of E.N.'s GAL and counsel and
advised N.O. that she would need to retain
counsel privately for any potential appeal.
N.T., 6/20/23, at 130; Order, 6/20/23. Following
the filing of the notice of appeal,
E.N.'s GAL and counsel filed applications
to withdraw in this Court, and we entered
an order denying the applications without
prejudice to seek relief in the trial court.
Order, 8/21/23. The trial court then entered
an order confirming its vacation of
GAL and counsel's appointment, determining
that N.O. can represent E.N.'s interests
as her guardian, and providing that
N.O. can retain private counsel at her own
expense, if she so chooses. Order, 8/29/23;
<EMBI>see also</EMBI> Pa.R.Civ.P. 2026 (providing that a
guardian appointed to the represent the
interest of a minor party in an action may
be a GAL, "the guardian of a minor appointed
by any court of competent jurisdiction,"
or "a person in the nature of a next
friend selected to represent" the minor).
As stated above, N.O. then filed an Appellee's
brief on behalf of her daughter.

<P20>Our research has revealed a
dearth of caselaw concerning the question
of whether a non-attorney parent may represent
her minor child in a court proceeding
or whether a non-attorney guardian
appointed by the court to represent the
best interests of a minor party may appear
<EM>pro se</EM> on behalf of the minor.<fnr1> Nonetheless,
we need not decide whether N.O. can
<Page 685>
represent her daughter in this appeal as
we strike her brief based upon its lack of
compliance with our appellate rules and its
reliance on matters that are not part of the
record. The brief consists of a two-page
letter, which fails to include a summary of
argument or argument section or either of
the certificates of compliance required by
the rules for an Appellee's brief. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.
R.A.P. 127, 2112, 2135(d). More importantly,
N.O.'s argument is predominately
based on excerpts of unidentified reports
concerning the incidents that were not
made part of the record below but which
N.O. nevertheless attaches as exhibits to
her brief. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Appellee's Brief at 1-2 (unnumbered),
Exhibits 1, 4A, 4B; Pa.R.A.P.
1921, Note ("An appellate court may consider
only the facts which have been duly
certified in the record on appeal."); <EMBI>In re
S.M.,</EMBI> 176 A.3d 927, 934 (Pa. Super. 2017)
(same). To the extent N.O. presents any
argument in her letter brief beyond discussion
of the non-record material, she merely
relies on the trial court's ruling from the
bench and its opinion. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Appellee's Brief
at 2, Appendix A. In light of these substantial
procedural defects, we strike the brief
filed by N.O. on behalf of her daughter,
E.N. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 2101 (briefs that are
not in compliance with appellate rules may
be suppressed); <EMBI>PHH Mortgage Corp. v.
Powell,</EMBI> 100 A.3d 611, 614 (Pa. Super.
2014) (striking materials in appellate brief
that are not in the certified record).

<P20>We now turn to the second preliminary
matter in this appeal. In the "Preface"
section of its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion, the
trial court questioned whether the Act
could be applied against a seven-year-old
defendant such as E.N., finding that the
"Pennsylvania Juvenile Act and common
law indicate[] that not only would granting
the final [SVPO] be improper, but the
initial granting of the temporary order was
improper."<fnr2> Trial Court Opinion, 9/22/23, at
2-7. The court noted that indirect criminal
contempt ("ICC") was not an available
remedy for any violation of the SVPO by
E.N. because the Act states that an ICC
charge against a minor shall be resolved in
a delinquency proceeding but a child under
ten years old cannot commit a delinquent
act under the Juvenile Act. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 3 (citing
42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 62A14(c), 6302). The court
observed that there exists a common law
rebuttable presumption that a child between
the ages of seven and fourteen lacks
the capacity to commit a crime, further
calling into question whether the Act
should be applied to children under ten.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 3-4. The court also found no support
in the Act for the relief that Appellant
sought to bar E.N. from A.W.'s school
through 12th grade, noting that the children's
"school is not a party to the action
and has no duty to A.W." and further that
the school had already instituted its own
safety plan. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 5-6 (citing N.T., 6/9/23,
at 82; N.T., 6/20/23, at 37-38).

<P20>We share the trial court's concerns
in applying the Act against a seven-year-old
defendant, as illustrated by the present
case. As noted by the lower court, the Act
does not set forth a viable enforcement
mechanism for a defendant of that age.
The principal means of enforcement of a
violation of an SVPO is through ICC
charges, whether initiated by law enforcement
or the plaintiff. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 42 Pa.C.S.
&sect;&sect; 62A12-62A14. However, as the trial
court noted, the Act provides that ICC of a
minor must proceed under the Juvenile
Act's delinquency procedure, 42 Pa.C.S.
<Page 686>
&sect; 62A14(c), and that statute does not allow
for a finding of delinquency of a child
under ten years old. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6302
(defining a "delinquent child" as being ten
years of age or older); <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Slocum,</EMBI> 86 A.3d 272, 280 n.11 (Pa. Super.
2014) ("[A] child under ten years of age
cannot commit a delinquent act as statutorily
defined."). The Act also allows a plaintiff
to file a petition for civil contempt, <EMBI>see</EMBI>
42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 62A15, which allows a court to
impose a prison term or financial sanctions
with the principal purpose of coercing the
contemnor into complying with a court order.
<EMBI>See Gunther v. Bolus,</EMBI> 853 A.2d 1014,
1016 (Pa. Super. 2004). However, we do
not believe that the General Assembly intended
the absurd result of permitting a
court to imprison or impose a financial
penalty on a seven-year-old child to coerce
them into complying with an SVPO order.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1922 ("In ascertaining the
intention of the General Assembly in the
enactment of a statute [it shall be presumed
that] the General Assembly does
not intend a result that is absurd, impossible
of execution or unreasonable.").<fnr3>

<P20>In light of the silence of the Act on
the subject,<fnr4> the absence of adequate briefing
on this issue, and our decision to affirm
the denial of an SVPO in this case, however,
we decline to rule as a matter of law
that the Act may not be applied to any
defendant under the age of ten. As the
trial court observed, under the common
law, the infancy defense provides a presumption
that a child between the ages of
seven and fourteen is incapable of forming
the wrongful intent to commit a criminal
act. <EMBI>See Commonwealth v. Martz,</EMBI> 118
A.3d 1175, 1180-81 (Pa. Super. 2015) (noting
that, while the infancy defense has
been abrogated in delinquency proceedings,
it remains a viable defense in criminal
cases not proceeding under the Juvenile
Act). However, a seven-year-old such
as E.N. falls within the age range, albeit at
the bottom of the range, where criminal
capacity can be found if evidence is presented
refuting the presumption. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
1180. Therefore, the common law presumption
would not preclude a finding that
a defendant between the ages of seven and
nine years old could have committed the
predicate sexually violent conduct that
forms the basis of an SVPO, as defined in
the Crimes Code.<fnr5> <EMBI>See</EMBI> 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 62A03
<Page 687>
(defining "sexual violence"). Furthermore,
even if a child under ten years old could
not be found in contempt, we cannot rule
out that an SVPO prohibiting a child defendant
from having contact with a victim
may be beneficial to the plaintiff for some
other purpose, such as in assisting school
officials in determining how to handle the
fallout of sexual misconduct among schoolmates.
Additionally, a court entering an
SVPO has discretion to tailor their relief to
the age of the defendant by "[g]ranting
any other appropriate relief sought by the
plaintiff." 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 62A07(b)(2).<fnr6>

<P20>We now turn to the issues Appellant
raises in this Court. In her first two
issues, Appellant argues that she presented
sufficient evidence to obtain an SVPO
where she showed both that A.W. was a
victim of sexual violence committed by
E.N. and that A.W. was at a continued risk
of harm from E.N. In this appeal, "we
employ the identical standard of review
that we use to review the propriety of an
order entered pursuant to the Act's seasoned
counterpart addressing the protection
of victims of physical or sexual abuse
by family members, i.e., the" PFA Act.
<EMBI>Weatherholtz v. McKelvey,</EMBI> 305 A.3d 103,
105-06 (Pa. Super. 2023) (quoting <EMBI>E.A.M.
v. A.M.D. III,</EMBI> 173 A.3d 313, 316 (Pa. Super.
2017)). We therefore review the trial
court's ruling to determine whether it
abused its discretion or made an error of
law. <EMBI>E.A.M.,</EMBI> 173 A.3d at 316.

<P20>When assessing the sufficiency of
the evidence supporting the trial court's
ruling on the SVPO petition, we review the
evidence in the light most favorable to the
prevailing party and grant all reasonable
inferences in her favor. <EMBI>Weatherholtz,</EMBI> 305
A.3d at 105; <EMBI>Kaur v. Singh,</EMBI> 259 A.3d 505,
509 (Pa. Super. 2021). Assessing the credibility
of witnesses and weight of the evidence
is within the exclusive authority of
the trial court as factfinder. <EMBI>Weatherholtz,</EMBI>
305 A.3d at 105; <EMBI>Kaur,</EMBI> 259 A.3d at 509.

<P20>The purpose of the Act is to provide
victims of sexual violence with a civil
remedy to ensure their safety and protection
regardless of whether they seek criminal
prosecution. 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 62A02(5), (6);
<EMBI>E.A.M.,</EMBI> 173 A.3d at 317. To establish a
right to relief under the Act, the plaintiff
must:

<B22>(1) assert that the plaintiff or another
individual, as appropriate, is a victim of
sexual violence [] committed by the defendant;
and

<B22>(2) prove by preponderance of the evidence
that the plaintiff or another individual,
as appropriate, is at a continued
risk of harm from the defendant.
<Page 688>

<P00>42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 62A06(a); <EMBI>K.N.B. v. M.D.,</EMBI> 668
Pa. 269, 259 A.3d 341, 344 (2021). "[T]he
statutory framework [of the Act] neither
anticipates nor requires criminal prosecution
or a finding of proof beyond a reasonable
doubt." <EMBI>E.A.M.,</EMBI> 173 A.3d at 318.

<P20>"Sexual violence" is defined under the
Act as "[c]onduct constituting a crime under
any of [several enumerated] provisions
[of the Crimes Code] between persons who
are not family or household members." 42
Pa.C.S. &sect; 62A03. Appellant asserts that the
evidence presented at the hearing showed
that A.W. was the victim of the enumerated
offense of aggravated indecent assault
where the testimony showed that E.N.
stuck her hand down A.W.'s pants while at
school, refused A.W.'s directions to stop,
and caused A.W. pain and an abrasion on
her genitals. The offense of aggravated
indecent assault prohibits an individual
from "engag[ing] in penetration, however
slight, of the genitals or anus of a complainant
with a part of the person's body
for any purpose other than good faith medical,
hygienic or law enforcement procedures,"
when done without the consent of
the complaint, by forcible compulsion, or to
a complainant who is under 13 years of
age. 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3125(a)(1), (2), (7).

<P20>In assessing the evidence presented at
the hearings, the trial court accepted the
timeline of events that was presented
through the testimony of A.W. and her
parents, as well as the experts Appellant
presented. N.T., 6/20/23, at 120-21; Trial
Court Opinion, 9/22/23, at 17. The court
found that A.W., E.N., and the rest of
their first-grade class were at the high
school on April 19, 2023, waiting to begin
practicing for a spring concert that evening,
when an interaction took place between
the two girls that involved E.N.
putting her hands down A.W.'s pants, inside
of her underwear. N.T., 6/20/23, at
120-21, 126; <EMBI>see</EMBI> N.T., 6/9/23, at 36, 59-60,
62-63; N.T., 6/20/23, at 32, 80-82, 99. A.W.
told E.N. that she wanted E.N. to stop,
but E.N. continued to touch A.W.'s private
parts. N.T., 6/20/23, at 120; <EMBI>see</EMBI> N.T.,
6/9/23, at 60; N.T., 6/20/23, at 35-37, 83, 87,
99. The incident caused A.W. to feel discomfort
and pain, A.W. suffered a small
abrasion on her labia majora and bleeding,
and another child noticed the incident and
asked what was happening. N.T., 6/20/23,
at 118-19, 124, 126-27; <EMBI>see</EMBI> N.T., 6/9/23, at
21-23, 36, 42-51, 60, 62-64; N.T., 6/20/23, at
9, 47, 78, 80-84, 87, 99, 108-09; Appellant's
Exhibit 3, at 13. A second incident occurred
on the bus ride back to the elementary
school where the two girls exposed
their own buttocks, and each touched the
other girl's buttocks. N.T., 6/20/23, at 120,
124, 126; <EMBI>see</EMBI> N.T., 6/20/23, at 31-32, 84-88,
99.<fnr7>

<P20>The trial court determined that aggravated
indecent assault did not occur on
these facts because there was no credible
allegation that E.N. had penetrated A.W.'s
vagina or anus. N.T., 6/20/23, at 119, 124-25;
Trial Court Opinion, 9/22/23, at 31-33.
The trial court noted that the forensic
examination report, as well as the testimony
<Page 689>
of Appellant's expert on forensic examination,
established that A.W.'s injury was
on the exterior of her labia majora, and
A.W.'s testimony was consistent with this
finding. N.T., 6/20/23, at 119, 124-25; Trial
Court Opinion, 9/22/23, at 31-33. To the
extent Appellant's account was inconsistent,
the trial court found the expert's
testimony and the report controlling. N.T.,
6/20/23, at 124-25; Trial Court Opinion,
9/22/23, at 32-33. The court further concluded
that the second incident only involved
touching of the exterior of the buttocks,
with no penetration of A.W.'s anus.
N.T., 6/20/23, at 124.

<P20>We discern no error in the trial court's
analysis. For the purposes of the aggravated
indecent assault statute, "the term `penetration,
however slight' is not limited to
penetration of the vagina; entrance in the
labia is sufficient." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Hunzer,</EMBI> 868 A.2d 498, 505-06 (Pa. Super.
2005) (citation omitted); <EMBI>see also Commonwealth
v. Gilliam,</EMBI> 249 A.3d 257, 269 (Pa.
Super. 2021). Appellant's expert reviewed
the report during her testimony, which
contained a "body map" reflecting the site
of the abrasion on "the exterior covering to
the vulva area" at "10 to 11 o'clock on the
labia majora." N.T., 6/9/23, at 21-23, 42-51;
Appellant's Exhibit 3, at 13. A.W. stated
that E.N. caused her pain and discomfort
by "wiggling around" and "digging in" her
"private parts" but her testimony did not
establish that E.N. penetrated A.W.'s labia.
N.T., 6/20/23, at 80-81, 99. Only Appellant
indicated that there was penetration
of the labia when she testified that the
abrasion was "between [A.W.'s] clitoris
and the lip on the inner side, not the outer
side of the lip," N.T., 6/9/23, at 64-65, but
the trial court specifically discredited this
testimony as it was directly contradicted to
her expert and the examination report.
N.T., 6/20/23, at 125; Trial Court Opinion,
9/22/23, at 15-16; <EMBI>see also infra</EMBI> (further
discussion of trial court's grounds for finding
Appellant's testimony incredible).

<P20>The record is even more clear that there
was no "penetration, however slight, of the
... anus," 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 3125(a), during the
second incident on the school bus. According
to A.W., the two girls participated in a
"butt feeling contest" that involved each
girl briefly touching the exterior of the
other girl's bare buttock. N.T., 6/20/23, at
31-32, 84, 88, 99-100. There is no testimony
that E.N. touched anywhere near A.W.'s
anus during this incident.

<P20>Appellant also asserts that A.W.
was a victim of sexual violence where E.N.
engaged in conduct consistent with the
offense of unlawful contact with a minor.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 6/20/23, at 123, 125 (finding that
Appellant had not proved that E.N. had
committed unlawful contact with a minor);
Trial Court Opinion, 9/22/23, at 7-9 (same).
That offense prohibits an individual from
contacting a minor, or a law enforcement
officer posing as a minor, "for the purpose
of engaging in an activity prohibited under,"
as relevant here, "[a]ny of the offenses
enumerated in Chapter 31 [of the
Crimes Code] (relating to sexual offenses)."
18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6318(a)(1). Appellant
contends that the underlying prohibited
activity that was the purpose of E.N.'s
contact with A.W. was aggravated indecent
assault because E.N.'s "conduct meets the
definition of" that offense. Appellant's
Brief at 23. However, the trial court found
that E.N. did not commit aggravated indecent
assault, a determination that we affirm
in this appeal. Appellant does not
argue that E.N. contacted A.W. for the
purpose of engaging in aggravated indecent
assault but was unsuccessful in completing
that act, nor does Appellant point
to any other underlying substantive offense
that served as the purpose for E.N.'s
contact with A.W.<fnr8> <EMBI>See Commonwealth v.</EMBI>
<Page 690>
<EMBI>Reed,</EMBI> 607 Pa. 629, 9 A.3d 1138, 1146 (2010)
(stating that "a defendant need not be
successful in completing the purpose of his
communication with a minor in order to be
found guilty of" unlawful contact with a
minor and that the defendant need not
have even been charged with the underlying
substantive offense). Therefore, Appellant
has provided us with no basis to overturn
the trial court's finding that E.N. did
not engage in unlawful contact with a minor.
We therefore find no merit in Appellant's
first and second claims challenging
the trial court's conclusion that she did not
present sufficient evidence to meet her
burden for an SVPO.

<P20>In her next issue, Appellant argues
that the trial court was biased against
her as a result of the fact that she remained
in the courtroom while other potential
witnesses were sequestered, even
though she is a party to the action and was
authorized to remain in the courtroom. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
Pa.R.E. 615(a) (allowing trial court to "order
witnesses sequestered so that they
cannot learn of other witnesses' testimony"
except as to, <EM>inter alia,</EM> "a party who is a
natural person"). Upon request from
E.N.'s counsel at the beginning of Appellant's
presentation of her case, the trial
court ordered all potential witnesses be
sequestered, including Appellant. N.T.,
6/9/23, at 15-16. When Appellant's counsel
noted that Appellant was a party and
should not be subject to a sequestration
order, the trial court agreed and permitted
her to stay. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 16-17. The court added
that:

<B22>I'll take into consideration, counsel, that
your client, [Appellant], is present during
the testimony and take that into
consideration when she provides her testimony
as well. But she's not required to
leave the courtroom.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 17-18.

<P20>Appellant maintains that this statement
by the court revealed "an impermissible
bias against her" when she was authorized
to remain in the courtroom. Appellant's
Brief at 33. Appellant contends that the
court's bias was further confirmed by its
findings that Appellant was both influenced
by and attempting to contradict the
testimony of her witnesses during her own
testimony, when in fact Appellant "was
merely trying to testify in her own words
from her own recollection of a traumatic
event." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 35.

<P20>As a separate indicia of trial court bias
against her, Appellant points to the court's
statement regarding her counsel's request
that E.N.'s mother, N.O., also be sequestered.
N.T., 6/9/23, at 18-19. Before directing
N.O. to step out of the courtroom, the
court inquired of Appellant's counsel
whether she intended to call N.O., and
counsel responded that she had not yet
decided whether to do so. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 19. In its
opinion, the court commented on this as
follows:

<B22>We note the disingenuous request to
exclude E.N.'s mother as a "potential
witness," even though she was not present
during the event. The request was
granted because the Appellant indicated
she was unsure if she would call E.N.'s
[m]other as a witness. [U]pon reflection,
it is clear that the Appellant had no
intention to call her, and merely sought
to exclude E.N.'s mother from the proceedings.

<P00>Trial Court Opinion, 9/22/23, at 14 n.14
(record citation omitted).

<P20>We have reviewed the record of the
hearings and the trial court's opinion and
do not find that the court held an impermissible
<Page 691>
bias against Appellant. The trial
court's statement that it would "take into
consideration" Appellant remaining in the
courtroom, N.T., 6/9/23, at 17-18, does not
show that the court prejudged Appellant's
testimony as incredible but simply the
court's recognition that it would evaluate
her testimony based upon the entire circumstances
of the case, including whether
Appellant was influenced by the testimony
of other witnesses. The trial court found
numerous reasons to find that Appellant's
testimony was not entirely credible, based
upon the influence from her expert's testimony
on her own and other independent
reasons. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 6/20/23, at 121-22, 124-26;
Trial Court Opinion, 9/22/23, at 15-20,
32-33, 34 n.29.<fnr9> These credibility findings
are supported by the record, <EMBI>see</EMBI> N.T.,
6/9/23, at 21, 23, 37-38, 42-51, 59-82; N.T.,
6/20/23, at 6-50, 84, 88, 99-100, 107-08; Appellant's
Exhibit 3, at 2, and we have no
cause to disturb them. <EMBI>Weatherholtz,</EMBI> 305
A.3d at 105; <EMBI>Kaur,</EMBI> 259 A.3d at 509. Furthermore,
we do not find fault with the
trial court's comment regarding Appellant's
exclusion of N.O. from the courtroom
in light of the unique posture of this
case involving a seven-year-old defendant
facing serious allegations of sexual misconduct.
It is not apparent to this Court what
relevant testimony N.O. could have provided
considering she was not a witness to
the incidents in questions, and Appellant
has not indicated what topics about which
she could have possibly called N.O. to testify.
Appellant's third issue thus warrants
no relief.

<P20>Appellant's final two issues are
challenges to the trial court's evidentiary
rulings. "Questions concerning the admission
or exclusion of evidence are within the
sound discretion of the trial court and may
be reversed on appeal only when a clear
abuse of discretion was present." <EMBI>E.K. v.
J.R.A.,</EMBI> 237 A.3d 509, 522-23 (Pa. Super.
2020) (citation omitted).

<P20>In her fourth issue, Appellant argues
that the trial court improperly ruled that
portions of the nurse's forensic examination
report reflecting Appellant's and
A.W.'s statements during the forensic
medical examination&mdash;specifically statements
within the "narrative" on the second
page of the report&mdash;would not be considered
for the truth of the matter asserted.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Appellant's Exhibit 3, at 2. While Appellant
concedes that the statements by
Appellant and A.W. were hearsay, she contends
that the statements were made for
the purpose of medical diagnosis and
therefore admissible under Pennsylvania
Rule of Evidence 803(4). This rule provides
an exception to the rule against hearsay
for a statement that:
<Page 692>

<B22>(A) is made for&mdash;and is reasonably pertinent
to&mdash;medical treatment or diagnosis
in contemplation of treatment; and

<B22>(B) describes medical history, past or
present symptoms, pain, or sensations,
or the inception or general character of
the cause or external source thereof,
insofar as reasonably pertinent to treatment,
or diagnosis in contemplation of
treatment.

<P00>Pa.R.E. 803(4).

<P20>At the hearing below, Appellant introduced
the forensic examination report that
was completed by Nurse Tami Hartlaub
following the examination of A.W. at York
Hospital. Appellant's Exhibit 3. Because
Nurse Hartlaub was not available to testify,
Appellant called her supervisor, Nurse
Emily Huggins, who was certified as the
hospital's custodian of records for the reports
and an expert in forensic examination.
N.T., 6/9/23, at 8-14. The report was
admitted as a record of a regularly conducted
activity under Rule of Evidence
803(6), and Nurse Huggins was permitted
to testify regarding the contents of the
report, including a description of Nurse
Hartlaub's physical examination of A.W.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 10, 12, 14, 21-26, 38-51. Over E.N.'s
objection, Nurse Huggins was also permitted
to testify regarding various statements
that Appellant and A.W. made to Nurse
Hartlaub reflected on page two of the report.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 10-12, 19-20, 26-38; Appellant's
Exhibit 3 at 2. While the court initially
ruled that it would not accept the statements
by Appellant and A.W. contained in
the report for the truth of the matters
asserted therein, the court ultimately allowed
the admission of the complete report.
N.T., 6/9/23, at 10-12, 28-35, 51-52;
N.T., 6/20/23, at 4-5, 66-68, 120-21.

<P20>In its Rule 1925(a) opinion, the trial
court stated that it considered the forensic
examination report in full, except for two
statements in the narrative that it did not
accept for their truth, Appellant's statement
that A.W. suffered from ADHD and
A.W.'s identification of E.N. as the individual
who touched her genitals. Trial Court
Opinion, 9/22/23, at 35-36; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T.,
6/9/23, at 28-32 (court sustaining E.N.'s
specific objections to Nurse Huggins' testimony
regarding ADHD diagnosis and
A.W.'s identification of E.N.). Of these two
statements, Appellant challenges only the
ruling with respect to A.W.'s statement
that "E.N. put her hand down my pants
and touched my privates and it hurt," Appellant's
Exhibit 3 at 2, arguing that the
trial court abused its discretion by failing
to "fully consider[]" this statement for its
truth. Appellant's Brief at 40.

<P20>We agree with the trial court
that the identification of E.N. as the
perpetrator of the incident was inadmissible
hearsay. It is well-established that a
statement identifying the individual who
causes the injury that leads the declarant
to seek medical treatment may not be
admitted under the Rule 803(4) exception.
<EMBI>See Commonwealth v. Smith,</EMBI> 545 Pa. 487,
681 A.2d 1288, 1292 (1996) (holding that a
"child's identification of her abuser is not
pertinent to her medical treatment or diagnosis");
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Vining,</EMBI> 744
A.2d 310, 319 (Pa. Super. 1999) (<EM>en banc</EM>)
("While disclosing the events surrounding
an injury may be important for medical
treatment or diagnosis, identifying the person
responsible for the injury is not medically
necessary."); Pa.R.E. 803(4), Comment
(noting that "statements as to fault
or identification of the person inflicting
harm have been held to be inadmissible"
and citing <EMBI>Smith</EMBI>). Because Appellant
sought to admit A.W.'s out-of-court statement
for the purpose of identifying E.N.
as the perpetrator of the unwanted touching,
N.T., 6/9/23, at 30, the trial court
properly found it inadmissible. <EMBI>Smith,</EMBI> 681
A.2d at 1292; <EMBI>Vining,</EMBI> 744 A.2d at 319. In
<Page 693>
any event, even if this ruling were in error,
Appellant suffered no prejudice as the trial
court heard identical evidence from A.W.
herself, <EMBI>see, e.g.,</EMBI> N.T., 6/20/23, at 81-82
(A.W. testifying <EM>in camera</EM> that E.N. was
"hurting me in my private parts"), and
accepted this account of the incident in its
findings of facts. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 117. Therefore,
Appellant is not entitled to relief on this
claim.

<P20>In her final issue, Appellant argues that
the trial court erred by ruling that she did
not give proper notice to E.N. of her intention
to enter into evidence A.W.'s out-of-court
statements under the Tender Years
Hearsay Act ("TYHA"), 42 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 5985.1, which permits the admission of
out-of-court statements by a child victim or
witness relating to certain statutorily enumerated
offenses, including the sexual offenses
at issue in this case. 42 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 5985.1(a). The TYHA requires that the
proponent notify her adversary of the intention
to offer the out-of-court statement
"and the particulars of the statement sufficiently
in advance of the proceeding ... to
provide the adverse party with a fair opportunity
to prepare to meet the statement."
42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5985.1(b).

<P20>Appellant contends that she effected
proper service of her notice of intent to
admit the TYHA statement under our civil
rules by mailing a copy of the notice to
E.N., who at that time was an unrepresented
party, more than two weeks in advance
of the initial hearing. N.T., 6/2/23, at
5-7, 11-12; Praecipe to Lodge Affidavit of
Service, 7/19/23; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> Pa.R.Civ.P.
440(a)(2)(i), (b). On June 2, 2023, the date
when the hearing was scheduled to commence,
Appellant indicated that she intended
to call A.W.'s psychiatrist, Dr.
Christina Downing, to testify as to A.W.'s
unavailability as a witness, <EMBI>see</EMBI> 42 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 5985.1(a.1)(2), but the trial court found
notice to be insufficient and continued the
hearing to June 5, 2023. N.T., 6/2/23, at 4-6,
9-10, 12, 14, 17. Appellant attempted to
call Dr. Downing on June 5th, but the trial
court again continued the matter to June
9th, when E.N.'s counsel conceded that
notice was proper, and Dr. Downing did
ultimately testify. N.T., 6/5/23, at 15-16;
N.T., 6/9/23, at 97-114. Appellant contends
that the "the trial court's rulings in preventing
the witness from being permitted
to present evidence on the first two days
of the proceedings were in error and prejudiced
the order of presentation of Appellant's
case." Appellant's Brief at 45.

<P20>The trial court ruled that Appellant's
initial THYA notice was improper
based upon N.O.'s representation that the
notice was not received at E.N.'s home,
the fact that notice was also not received
at the judicial chambers to which the notice
was also allegedly sent, and further
that the notice did not sufficiently identify
the particulars of A.W.'s statements that
Appellant sought to introduce. N.T., 6/2/23,
at 6-8, 12-14; Trial Court Opinion, 9/22/23,
at 29-30. Even assuming these rulings
were in error, however, Appellant suffered
no prejudice from the court's ruling as
Appellant was able to call Dr. Downing to
testify concerning A.W.'s unavailability on
June 9, 2023, the first day at which Appellant
was permitted to present any witnesses.<fnr10>
The continuances were not based
<Page 694>
upon the issue of whether adequate notice
had been provided under the TYHA, but
rather related to E.N.'s representation and
the court's decision to appoint a GAL and
legal counsel for E.N. N.T., 6/2/23, at 14,
17, 21; N.T., 6/5/23, at 9-14. While we
sympathize with Appellant regarding the
inconveniences that the two continuances
caused for the presentation of her cause,
we cannot fault the trial court's vigilance
in insuring that E.N.'s rights to representation
were safeguarded.

<P20>Accordingly, we conclude that none of
Appellant's issues are meritorious, and we
affirm the trial court's order denying an
SVPO against E.N.

<P20>Order affirmed. Appellee's brief stricken.

<fnt*> Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.

<fnt1> With very limited exceptions not applicable
here, a non-attorney is prohibited from representing
other parties in Pennsylvania courts
as to do so would constitute the unauthorized
practice of law. <EMBI>Barrett v. M&B Medical Billing,
Inc.,</EMBI> 291 A.3d 371, 376 (Pa. Super. 2022);
<EMBI>Delaware Valley Landscape Stone, Inc. v.
RRQ, LLC,</EMBI> 284 A.3d 459, 462 (Pa. Super.
2022); <EMBI>Walacavage v. Excell 2000, Inc.,</EMBI> 331
Pa.Super. 137, 480 A.2d 281, 284-85 (1984).
This rule has been applied to bar non-attorneys
from appearing in court on behalf of
corporations, trusts, and estates. <EMBI>See Bisher v.
Lehigh Valley Health Network, Inc.,</EMBI> ___ Pa.
___, 265 A.3d 383, 389-90, 394 (2021) (non-attorney
parent, who was the administrator of
her son's estate, could not bring a survival
action on behalf of the estate); <EMBI>Barrett,</EMBI> 291
A.3d at 377 (corporate officer was prohibited
from representing her employer in litigation);
<EMBI>Delaware Valley,</EMBI> 284 A.3d at 463 (non-attorney
trustees could not represent trust in legal
proceeding). This Court additionally has ruled
that individuals must appear through an attorney,
even when the putative representative
is a family member or is designated as the
party's power of attorney. <EMBI>See Frezghi v. Tesfamariam,</EMBI>
276 A.3d 1209, 1211-13 (Pa. Super.
2022) (nephew could not represent non-English-speaking
uncle in suit, even though
the uncle had designated the nephew as his
power of attorney); <EMBI>Kohlman v. Western
Pennsylvania Hospital,</EMBI> 438 Pa.Super. 352,
652 A.2d 849, 850 (Pa. Super. 1994) (individual
designated as power of attorney could not
file legal action on behalf of another, notwithstanding
the fact that Probate Code authorizes
an attorney-in-fact to "pursue claims and
litigation" on behalf of the principal).

<P00>While the question of whether a non-attorney
guardian or parent may represent a child has
not been answered under Pennsylvania law,
we note that the overwhelming balance of
cases from other jurisdictions answers this
question in the negative. <EMBI>See, e.g., Osei-Afriyie
by Osei-Afriyie v. Medical College of Pennsylvania,</EMBI>
937 F.2d 876, 882 (3d Cir. 1991) (holding
that "a non-lawyer appearing <EM>pro se,</EM> [i]s
not entitled to play the role of attorney for his
children in federal court"); <EMBI>Estate of Snelgrove
v. LeBlanc,</EMBI> 311 A.3d 114, 115 (Vt.
2023) (holding that non-attorney guardian
could not represent ward in court proceedings
without an attorney and collecting state
and federal cases with similar rulings); <EMBI>Chisholm
v. Rueckhaus,</EMBI> 124 N.M. 255, 948 P.2d
707, 709 (N.M. Ct. App. 1997) ("We join an
overwhelming majority of jurisdictions and
hold that a non-attorney parent must be represented
by counsel in bringing an action on
behalf of a child.").

<fnt2> E.N. raised similar arguments in her counseled
motion to dismiss, wherein she sought
dismissal of the petition on the grounds that
the Act is unconstitutionally vague, conflicts
with the Juvenile Act, and violates due process
when applied against minors under ten
years old. Motion to Dismiss, 6/9/23, &para;&para;8-31.
The trial court did not rule on the motion.
N.T., 6/20/23, at 116.

<fnt3> Appellant argued below that she could seek
to enforce the SVPO in event of any violation
by obtaining a finding of civil contempt by
E.N. and then establishing the liability of
E.N.'s parents under Section 5504 of the Domestic
Relations Code. 23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 5504(a)
("If a judgment has been rendered against the
child in a civil action for injury because of the
tortious act of the child and the judgment has
not been satisfied within a period of 30 days,
the injured person may petition the court for
a rule to show cause why judgment should
not be entered against the parent."). This argument
fails because Section 5504 allows an
individual to collect from a parent only in
cases where there is a "judgment" against the
child based upon an "injury" caused by the
child's "tortious act." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> By contrast, an
SVPO is not a monetary judgment, does not
adjudicate whether the defendant committed
a tortious act, and does not require a showing
of an injury but only a "risk of harm" to the
protected party. 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 62A06(a)(2);
<EMBI>K.N.B. v. M.D.,</EMBI> 668 Pa. 269, 259 A.3d 341,
348 (2021) ("[T]he [Act] does not provide victims
of sexual violence with a cause of action
for tortious conduct ... [and] does not explicitly
allow for the recovery of personal or
property damages.") (citation omitted).

<fnt4> While there is no minimum age set forth in
the Act for a defendant where an SVPO is
sought, a protection order from intimidation
is only available where "a person 18 years of
age or older" commits conduct consistent
with the offenses of harassment or stalking
"against a person under 18 years of age." 42
Pa.C.S. &sect; 62A03.

<fnt5> We do not hold that a plaintiff bringing a
petition under the Act must rebut the presumption
of incapacity in cases where the
defendant is between the ages of seven and
fourteen, as the trial court found that Appellant
had not done in this case with respect
to E.N. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 6/20/23, at 125-28; Trial
Court Opinion, 9/22/23, at 10-11. In <EMBI>Martz,</EMBI>
we noted that while the common-law infancy
defense has been abrogated in delinquency
proceedings, the defense remains viable in
criminal cases not proceeding under the Juvenile
Act. 118 A.3d at 1180-81. However,
<EMBI>Martz</EMBI> arose in the context of a criminal trial
against an adult based in part on conduct
that occurred while he was a minor, while a
strict finding of proof of criminal conduct
beyond a reasonable doubt is not required
for cases brought under the Act. <EMBI>See E.A.M.
v. A.M.D. III,</EMBI> 173 A.3d 313, 318 (Pa. Super.
2017). It is sufficient for present purposes to
note that the presumption of incapacity, if
applied, would not entirely foreclose a finding
that a seven-year-old child could commit
the predicate conduct for an SVPO.

<fnt6> We nevertheless caution trial courts, in any
future cases where SVPOs are issued against
defendants under the age of ten, from including
language that the defendant can be
charged with ICC for violating the SVPO and
authorizing law enforcement to arrest the defendant
without a warrant. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.R.Civ.P.
1959 (setting forth form protection orders).

<fnt7> Appellant objects to the trial court's description
of a "mutual touching" between A.W.
and E.N., Appellant's Brief at 24-27; N.T.,
6/20/23, at 124, but it is clear that this reference
is only to the second incident on the
school bus where the girls touched each other's
buttocks. N.T., 6/20/23, at 124, 126; Trial
Court Opinion, 9/22/23, at 34-35. The record
supports the court's finding that this incident
was "mutual" where A.W. agreed to touch
E.N.'s buttocks and allow E.N. to touch her
own willingly, albeit only because A.W. was
scared of E.N. N.T., 6/20/23, at 84, 88, 99-100.
The trial court specifically rejected Appellant's
account that A.W. first told E.N.
"no" before the buttocks touching occurred
because this was contrary to A.W.'s testimony.
N.T., 6/20/23, at 31; Trial Court Opinion,
9/22/23, at 34 n.29.

<fnt8> We note that Appellant also asserted below
that E.N. perpetrated indecent assault against
A.W., N.T., 6/2/23, at 19-20, but she has abandoned
that claim on appeal.

<fnt9> The trial court found Appellant's testimony
not wholly credible based upon the fact that
Appellant's testimony was strongly influenced
by the testimony of her forensic examination
expert witness; conflicts between Appellant's
testimony and that of the expert, including on
issues such as the size and location of the
abrasion on A.W.'s labia and whether A.W.
was in physical distress during the exam;
Appellant's paraphrasing of A.W. with more
severe words and a more embellished account
as well as Appellant's inability to remember
which words were hers and which were her
daughter's; Appellant's shifting tone and demeanor
based upon who was examining her;
her evasiveness when answering a question
that might prove unfavorable to her; and Appellant's
"unnecessarily inflammatory" language
about E.N., including her description
of E.N. as a "predator" and the unfounded
concern that E.N. would bring a knife to
school to harm A.W. Trial Court Opinion,
9/22/23, at 15-20, 23-24, 32, 34 n.29 (quoting
N.T., 6/9/23, at 75); <EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T., 6/20/23, at
121, 125-26. The court stressed that it did not
find Appellant entirely incredible, as the court
accepted "Appellant's general timeline of
events [as] credible, just not her detailed narration
of the events." Trial Court Opinion,
9/22/23, at 17; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> N.T., 6/20/23, at 121.

<fnt10> Appellant does not challenge the trial
court's denial of her request to consider
A.W.'s out-of-court statements under the
TYHA on the basis that A.W. "was in fact not
unavailable as a witness[] and was more than
willing to communicate with the [c]ourt [during
her <EM>in camera</EM> testimony] and very animated
in doing so." N.T., 6/20/23, at 117. Notwithstanding
this ruling, it appears that the
court did consider all of A.W.'s out-of-court
statements offered at the hearing through the
testimony of Appellant, A.W.'s father, and in
the forensic examination report. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at
120-21 (noting that the trial court considered
A.W.'s hearsay statements to her parents
when making its findings). While the court
did not consider A.W.'s identification of E.N.
as the perpetrator of the unwanted touching
that was captured in the forensic examination
report, identical statements came in during
A.W.'s <EM>in camera</EM> testimony. <EMBI>See supra.</EMBI>

Judge.
[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <dgn>JUDGE</dgn> <author>COHN
JUBELIRER</author>.
[MT]
<P20>Before this Court is the petition for
review filed by Anna Griffis (Claimant), in
<Page 700>
which she challenges the Workers' Compensation
(WC) Appeal Board's (Board)
February 13, 2019 Order. In that Order,
the Board affirmed a Workers' Compensation
Judge's (WCJ) August 15, 2017 Decision
(2017 WCJ Decision): (1) granting the
Modification Petition filed by Albert Einstein
Medical Center (Medical Center),<fnr1>
thereby allowing Medical Center to subrogate
Claimant's third-party civil recovery
in her medical malpractice action; (2) denying
Claimant's Review Petition, which
sought to expand Claimant's accepted
work injuries to include C4-5 and C5-6 disc
hernias; and (3) denying litigation costs on
the basis that Claimant had not prevailed
on any of the contested issues. On appeal,
Claimant asserts the Board erred by allowing
Medical Center to subrogate her
third-party recovery because there was no
"third party" involved in that action, Medical
Center waived its right to subrogation,
and the medical malpractice, if it occurred,
did not worsen Claimant's condition. The
Board further erred, Claimant asserts, in
denying her Review Petition because the
medical testimony upon which the WCJ
and the Board relied to find the additional
injuries were not work related was not
competent. Finally, Claimant maintains the
Board erred in not directing an award of
litigation costs because the WCJ did expand
Claimant's work-related injuries to
include psychological injuries.

<HN20><EMB>I. Background</EMB>

<HN20><EM>A. Factual History</EM>

<CN>1. <EMU>Claimant's "Employer"</EMU>

<P20>There is a dispute as to which entity
employed Claimant at the time of her work
injury. Claimant asserts that Albert Einstein
Healthcare Network (Healthcare
Network) was her employer, and she identified
that name on the Petition for Review
and the other documents she has filed with
this Court. Claimant also offered the June
14, 2013 Decision by the WCJ (2013 WCJ
Decision) that resolved multiple review petitions
filed by Claimant and a modification
petition filed by "[t]he defendant," listed
there as Healthcare Network, by a stipulation
of the parties. (Reproduced Record
(R.R.) at 13a, 16a.) The introductory paragraph
of the stipulation of facts related to
the 2013 WCJ Decision (2013 Stipulation)
identified Healthcare Network as Claimant's
employer. (<EM>Id.</EM> at 17a.) However, the
Notice of Temporary Compensation Payable
(NTCP), which converted to a Notice
of Compensation Payable (NCP) by operation
of law, lists Claimant's employer as
"Long Term Structured Residence &mdash;
AEHN." (<EM>Id.</EM> at 317a.) Medical Center presented
the deposition testimony of its Human
Relations Director (HR Director), reflecting
that Healthcare Network is merely
an umbrella entity that consists of various
corporate subsidiaries, including Medical
Center and the Einstein Practice Plan,
Inc. (EPPI), which do not control each
other. (HR Director's Dep. at 8-9, R.R. at
551a-52a.) HR Director testified that Medical
Center is Claimant's employer because
Belmont Center for Comprehensive Treatment
(Belmont), where Claimant worked
at the time of her injury, fell within Medical
Center's corporate structure. (<EM>Id.</EM> at 9,
R.R. at 552a.) A subsequent decision issued
by WCJ Michael Rosen on November
11, 2014, identified Medical Center as
Claimant's employer. (R.R. at 410a.) In the
<Page 701>
current litigation, the documents, other
than those filed by Claimant with this
Court, identify Claimant's employer as
Medical Center. The WCJ credited HR
Director's testimony over Claimant's conflicting
evidence and found that Claimant
was employed by Medical Center. (2017
WCJ Decision, Finding of Fact (FOF)
&para; 17.)

<CN>2. <EMU>Claimant's Injury</EMU>

<P20>Claimant worked as a Registered Nurse
at Belmont until the evening of April 28,
2009, when she fell down a flight of stairs
and struck the back of her neck on a
handrail. (<EM>Id.</EM> &para;&para; 1-2.) Immediately following
the incident, she experienced head and
neck pain and numbness and tingling in
her right arm. Claimant sought immediate
treatment at an emergency room located
across the street from Belmont. Claimant
was transferred to Medical Center's Emergency
Room that evening, where she underwent
x-rays and a CT scan at the direction
of Kenneth Lavelle, M.D. and Jay
Strain, M.D. After reviewing Claimant's
diagnostic tests, Dr. Lavelle and Dr. Strain
discharged Claimant on the morning of
April 29, 2009, with the diagnosis of a neck
strain. Following her discharge, Claimant
continued to experience worsening symptoms,
including tingling and numbness in
her right foot and weakness in her right
hand. Claimant reported to Medical Center's
Occupational Health facility on April
30, 2009, which transferred her to Medical
Center's Emergency Room. While Claimant
was obtaining an emergency MRI
scan, she experienced a total inability to
move her legs and loss of feeling in her
lower body. Upon review of the MRI film,
it was discovered that Claimant had an
acute C6-7 disc hernia and hematoma that
were compressing her spinal cord resulting
in a complete spinal cord injury. Claimant
underwent emergency decompression surgery
that same day. Although Claimant
regained the use of her lower extremities,
she continues to suffer from significant
neurological dysfunctions. She has not returned
to any work since April 28, 2009.

<P20>An NTCP was issued on May 11, 2009,
recognizing Claimant's work-related injury
as being in the nature of "cervical strain"
and totally disabling. (<EM>Id.</EM> &para; 3.) The NTCP
subsequently converted to an NCP by operation
of law. In June 2013, Claimant's
work-related injury was expanded, by stipulation
of the parties, to include "status
post anterior cervical discectomy at C6-7
with evacuation of an epidural hematoma
at C6-7 and anterior antibody arthrodesis
and application of an anterior plate at C6-7,
right C5-6 and C6-7 radiculopathy, right
foot drop, and neurogenic bladder." (<EM>Id.</EM>
&para; 4 (internal quotation marks omitted).)
Claimant received ongoing indemnity benefits
and medical treatment for these accepted
injuries.

<CN>3. <EMU>Claimant's Third-Party Civil
Action and Settlement</EMU>

<P20>On May 24, 2010, Claimant and her husband
(Husband) initiated a civil lawsuit
against, among others, Dr. Lavelle, Dr.
Strain, Healthcare Network, Medical Center,
and EPPI, alleging that Dr. Lavelle
and Dr. Strain were negligent because
they failed to properly diagnose her cervical
spinal cord compression and failed to
obtain an MRI. (<EM>Id.</EM> &para; 5.) As a result of
their negligence, Claimant averred she incurred
additional medical expenses and
could no longer perform her occupation.
(<EM>Id.</EM>) Husband filed a claim asserting a loss
of consortium. Claimant averred that, due
to the neurologic symptoms she was experiencing
on April 29, 2009, Dr. Lavelle and
Dr. Strain should have ordered an MRI
scan, as that is the best method of determining
whether a spinal cord injury is
present. She further alleged that the doctors'
reliance on the CT scan and x-ray
results fell below the standard of care for
a patient experiencing progressively worsening
neurologic symptoms. The parties
<Page 702>
entered into a high-low arbitration agreement
(Arbitration Agreement), which identified
Claimant and Husband as the plaintiffs
and Dr. Lavelle and Dr. Strain as the
defendants. (R.R. at 269a.) The Arbitration
Agreement capped the total recovery at
$2.4 million and explained how payment of
that amount would be split between
Broadline Risk Retention Group, Inc.
(Broadline RRG) and the Medical Care
Availability and Reduction of Error Fund
(MCARE Fund) depending on the percentage
of liability each doctor was found
to have. (<EM>Id.</EM> at 270a-71a.) Following the
presentation of evidence, a civil arbitrator
found Dr. Lavelle and Dr. Strain negligent
and awarded Claimant $2.5 million and
Husband $375,000. (Verdict Sheet, R.R. at
267a-68a.) Based upon the arbitrator's apportionment
of damages, Claimant's portion
of the recovery was $2.088 million.
(FOF &para; 9.) Claimant and Husband subsequently
executed a full release against all
the parties involved in the medical malpractice
action, including Healthcare Network,
Medical Center, and EPPI.

<CN>4. <EMU>The Petitions</EMU>

<P20>In 2013, Medical Center filed
modification petitions seeking subrogation
reimbursement per Section 319 of the
Workers' Compensation Act (WC Act)<fnr2>
against Claimant's civil recovery from her
medical malpractice action, but these petitions
were dismissed without prejudice for
lack of prosecution on November 7, 2014.
(Board Opinion (Op.) at 2 n.1; R.R. at
410a-12a.) On December 19, 2014, Medical
Center filed the current Modification Petition,<fnr3>
seeking subrogation reimbursement
per Section 319. (Supplemental Reproduced
Record (S.R.R.) at 419b-20b.) Medical
Center requested that its relief commence
on April 8, 2013. (<EM>Id.</EM> at 419b.)
Claimant filed an answer, specifically denying
Medical Center's allegations. (Certified
Record at Item 4.) On April 27, 2016,
Claimant filed her Review Petition, asserting
that the description of her injury was
incorrect and the NCP should be amended
to include C5-6 and C6-7 disc hernias "and
a pain disorder associated with both psychological
factors and a general medical
condition."<fnr4> (S.R.R. at 73b-74b.) In its answer,
Medical Center admitted Claimant
had "developed an emotional injury/depression,"
but denied that the asserted
disc hernias were the result of the April
28, 2009, work injury. (<EM>Id.</EM> at 76b.) It is
undisputed that Medical Center had been
paying for the treatment of Claimant's
psychological condition. The Petitions were
consolidated and assigned to the WCJ for
resolution.

<HN20>B. <EM>Proceedings before the WCJ</EM>

<CN>1. <EMU>The Modification Petition</EMU>

<CN>(a) The Medical Evidence

<P20>In support of its Modification Petition,
Medical Center presented the deposition
<Page 703>
testimony of Lee Harris, M.D.,<fnr5> who testified
as follows. Dr. Harris, a board-certified
neurologist, examined Claimant at
Medical Center's request on October 13,
2014. Following his examination and review
of Claimant's medical records, Dr.
Harris opined that Claimant's work injury
resulted in an acute C6-7 herniated disc
that caused a spinal cord compression and
a complete spinal cord injury. (FOF &para; 10.)
In his opinion, the nearly two-day delay
between Claimant's initial treatment in
Medical Center's Emergency Room and
the decompression surgery "caused the
Claimant to develop significant neurological
dysfunction, including bladder dysfunction
and ambulatory dysfunction." (<EM>Id.</EM>)
Had Claimant's decompression surgery
been performed sooner, Claimant would
not have experienced complete paraplegia
in her lower extremities or developed urologic
and neurologic impairments. Further,
had Claimant been correctly diagnosed
and treated, she would have had "a complete
or near complete recovery and would
have been able to return to her normal
work." (<EM>Id.</EM>)

<P20>In opposition to the Modification Petition,
Claimant offered the deposition testimony
of Robert Sing, D.O., a board-certified
family practitioner, who testified as
follows.<fnr6> Dr. Sing examined Claimant on
April 14, 2016, at which time he obtained a
history of Claimant's work injury and the
treatment thereof. From his examination,
he found that Claimant continued to experience
pain and stiffness with spasms in
her neck, a dropped right foot, unsteady
gait for which she uses a cane, sleep disruptions,
a neurogenic bladder, and depression/emotional
problems. He also reviewed
various medical records related to
Claimant's treatment, as well as records
related to Claimant's medical malpractice
action. After reviewing the reports, but not
the studies themselves, from the CT scans
initially performed on Claimant's brain and
cervical spine, Dr. Sing indicated the CT
did not reveal a hemorrhage or trauma to
Claimant's brain and no subluxation or
fracture of her cervical spine. Reviewing
the report, but not the study itself, from
the April 30, 2009 MRI of Claimant's cervical
spine, Dr. Sing opined that the MRI
showed a six-centimeter-long mass at C6-7.
In Dr. Sing's opinion, Claimant's disc extrusion
at C6-7 did not occur until Claimant
was in the MRI machine that day. Dr.
Sing opined that CT scans are preferable
to MRI scans to diagnose soft tissue injuries,
like the one here. (R.R. at 444a-45a.)
Thus, in Dr. Sing's opinion, "the emergency
room doctors did not commit any malpractice
that would have increased the degree
or duration of the Claimant's work
injury." (FOF &para; 11(f).) He further explained,
even if there had been medical
malpractice, it would not have extended
Claimant's degree of disability and "she
would have ended up here anyway." (R.R.
at 455a.)

<P20>In rebuttal to Dr. Sing's testimony,
Medical Center presented a second deposition
of Dr. Harris.<fnr7> Dr. Harris testified
that when Claimant initially presented to
the emergency rooms, she was already
complaining of a tingling sensation in her
<Page 704>
upper extremities, reflecting that she was
experiencing spinal cord compression.
(FOF &para; 12.) The existence of this symptom
immediately after the fall establishes that
Claimant did not develop the disc hernia
while in the MRI two days later. He disagreed
with Dr. Sing's testimony that the
CT scan was ordered to assess whether
Claimant had sustained a soft tissue injury
because it was ordered to determine
whether she had a fracture. Contrary to
Dr. Sing's opinion, Dr. Harris testified that
CT scans are used to "identify bony pathology."
(<EM>Id.</EM>) He reiterated his earlier
opinions that if Claimant had received the
decompression surgery following her initial
admission to Medical Center's Emergency
Room, "she would not have developed
weakness and dysthesia in the right upper
and lower extremities, ambulatory dysfunction,
neurogenic bladder[,] and neuropathic
pain syndrome." (<EM>Id.</EM>)

<P20>Medical Center also presented the deposition
testimony of Robert Pinsk, M.D., a
board-certified radiologist, who reviewed
the films of Claimant's cervical CT scans
and the MRI scan of her cervical spine and
testified as follows.<fnr8> Dr. Pinsk noted that
the CT films revealed degenerative
changes at C5-6 and a moderate disc hernia
on the right side of C6-7 that was
affecting Claimant's spinal cord and causing
spinal stenosis. The MRI films showed
an eight-millimeter "mass-like structure
posterior to the C6-7 space causing mass
effects upon the cervical spinal cord and
severe central spinal stenosis." (<EM>Id.</EM> &para; 13.)
Like Dr. Harris, Dr. Pinsk disagreed with
Dr. Sing's position that CT scans are superior
to MRI scans at assessing soft tissue
pathology. Dr. Pinsk noted that Dr. Sing
did not review the actual films of any
diagnostic studies. Instead Dr. Sing was
only repeating what was included on those
studies' reports, as evidenced by Dr. Sing's
testimony that Claimant's C6-7 disc herniation
was six <EMB>centimeters</EMB> in length, which
was clearly a typographical error in the
report as disc hernias are measured in
<EMB>millimeters.</EMB>

<CN>(b) Other Evidence

<P20>In addition to the medical evidence,
Medical Center relied on HR Director's
deposition testimony in support of its Modification
Petition.<fnr9> As mentioned, HR Director
described the relationship between
Healthcare Network and its separate, subsidiary
corporate entities, such as Medical
Center and EPPI. She testified as follows.
Claimant worked for Medical Center when
she was injured, and Dr. Lavelle and Dr.
Strain were employed by EPPI. EPPI,
Medical Center, and Healthcare Network
are separate corporate entities with distinct
and separate chains of command
without financial interest or ownership interest
in each other. Finally, HR Director
pointed out that Medical Center's Emergency
Room was not an employee dispensary
but a trauma center.

<P20>Claimant testified before the WCJ and
by deposition as follows.<fnr10> She was employed
by "Albert Einstein Health Systems."
(FOF &para; 15.) Claimant continues to
seek treatment for her work-related injuries
with various physicians and has difficulty
functioning. Claimant continues to
receive her WC benefits, as well as Social
<Page 705>
Security Disability benefits. Claimant explained
her symptoms worsened progressively
from the time of the fall until she
underwent the MRI. (<EM>Id.</EM> &para; 16.) Believing
she was not properly treated initially,
Claimant retained counsel in May 2010 to
bring her medical malpractice action.

<P20>Medical Center also introduced into evidence
the original civil complaint, the
Agreement, the arbitrator's verdict sheet,
and the full and final release signed by
Claimant and Husband. Claimant also introduced
a discovery deposition of Dr. Lavelle
from the medical malpractice action,
in which she claims he testified that on
April 29, 2009, he was employed by
Healthcare Network. However, Dr. Lavelle
was asked where he was employed,
not by whom he was employed. (R.R. at
325a.)

<CN>2. <EMU>The Review Petition</EMU>

<P20>In addition to her own testimony, Claimant
relied on Dr. Sing to support her Review
Petition. Dr. Sing testified as follows.
Based on his review of a report of a 2016
MRI of Claimant's cervical spine, Dr. Sing
opined that Claimant had developed disc
hernias at C4-5 and C5-6, which are two
levels higher than the acknowledged C6-7
disc hernia. (FOF &para; 11(g).) He related
these two new hernias to Claimant's initial
injury and surgery as being "evolutionary
herniations ... due to the instability of her
cervical spine, the hardware and just day-to-day
functioning ...." (R.R. at 439a-40a.)
Therefore, Dr. Sing opined these two
hernias were also work related.

<P20>Medical Center presented Dr. Harris's
and Dr. Pinsk's deposition testimony in
opposition to the Review Petition. After
reviewing the actual films of Claimant's
diagnostic studies, Dr. Harris opined that
the 2016 MRI did not reveal a disc hernia
at C5-6, although there was a protrusion
that was present in an August 2009 MRI.
In Dr. Harris's opinion, the changes at C4-5
and C5-6 were the result of preexisting,
long-standing degenerative changes, not
the work injury. (FOF &para; 12.) Dr. Pinsk
noted that Claimant's diagnostic studies
only showed mild degenerative changes
between C2-3 and C5-6. (<EM>Id.</EM> &para; 13.)

<CN>3. <EMU>The 2017 WCJ Opinion</EMU>

<P20>Reviewing this evidence, the WCJ found
Claimant's testimony generally credible
but rejected that testimony to the extent it
was contradicted by Medical Center's expert
medical evidence and by HR Director's
testimony as to what entity employed
Claimant and Drs. Lavelle and
Strain. (<EM>Id.</EM> &para; 17.) The WCJ found the
opinions of Dr. Harris and Dr. Pinsk credible
and rejected the contrary opinions of
Dr. Sing as not credible. In making these
determinations, the WCJ noted that Dr.
Harris and Dr. Pinsk reviewed the actual
CT and MRI films to render their opinions,<fnr11>
and Dr. Sing relied solely on the
reports of those studies by other physicians.
(<EM>Id.</EM> &para; 19.) The WCJ further observed
that Dr. Sing's opinions were "completely
contrary to the civil verdict that
has already established the malpractice in
issue." (<EM>Id.</EM>) In contrast, the WCJ found
that the opinions of Dr. Pinsk and Dr.
Harris are "consistent with the Claimant's
unchallenged testimony about the development
of her symptoms and the civil verdict."
(<EM>Id.</EM>) The WCJ found that, to the
limited extent Dr. Lavelle's deposition was
relevant, it was not persuasive given the
result of the third-party lawsuit and the
credible testimony of Medical Center's witnesses.
<Page 706>

<P20>Based on the credited evidence, the
WCJ concluded that, due to the malpractice
committed by Dr. Lavelle and Dr.
Strain, "Claimant has developed permanent
neurological impairment and dysfunction
including ambulatory dysfunction and
neurologic dysfunction that has required
[Medical Center] to continue to pay compensation
for total disability and related
medical expenses." (<EM>Id.</EM> &para; 20.) Therefore,
the WCJ held that Medical Center established
its right to subrogation against
Claimant's third-party civil recovery. (2017
WCJ Decision, Conclusions of Law (COL)
&para; 2.) The WCJ further found that, due to
the lack of credible expert evidence,
Claimant did not prove that the C4-5 and
C5-6 disc hernias were related to her work
injury. (<EM>Id.</EM> &para; 1.) Finally, noting that Medical
Center had agreed that Claimant's
work injury included a psychological component
following the filing of the Review
Petition, the WCJ found this issue was not
actually in dispute. (FOF &para; 21.) Accordingly,
the WCJ did not award litigation costs
because Claimant had not prevailed on any
litigated issues. (COL &para; 4.)

<HN20><EM>C. The Board's Opinion</EM>

<P20>Claimant appealed to the Board, arguing
that the grant of the Modification Petition,
the denial of the Review Petition, and the
denial of litigation costs were in error.
Claimant first asserted that there was no
"third-party" recovery in this matter because
her employer and the entity from
which she recovered in that action were
the same, the right to subrogation is either
waived or barred by res judicata or laches,
and the medical malpractice did not worsen
Claimant's medical condition. The
Board disagreed with each of Claimant's
contentions. The Board held that, in cases
involving multiple, affiliated corporate entities,
the Supreme Court has held that, for
purposes of the WC Act, each "subsidiary
corporate entity retains its own identity
separate and apart from another subsidiary
corporation and the parent corporation."
(Board Op. at 4 (citing <EM>Kiehl v.
Action Mfg. Co.,</EM> 517 Pa. 183, 535 A.2d 571
(1987)).) Citing HR Director's credited testimony,
the Board held that the record
does not support Claimant's argument because
Medical Center is a separate corporate
entity from EPPI, which employed
Dr. Lavelle and Dr. Strain, and both of
those entities are separate corporate entities
from the parent corporation, Healthcare
Network. (<EM>Id.</EM> at 10.) Pursuant to
<EM>Kiehl,</EM> each of these corporate entities retained
their own identities and, therefore,
the Board concluded that the WCJ did not
err in holding that Medical Center could
recover its subrogation lien.

<P20>As for Claimant's res judicata arguments,
which were premised on a contention
that the identity of her employer was
settled in prior litigation, the Board held
that there was no evidence that the corporate
identity of Claimant's employer had
ever been determined. (<EM>Id.</EM> at 11.) In addition,
observing that subrogation under
Section 319 is automatic, the Board held
that equitable defense of laches is not applicable
and that while an employer can
compromise or waive its subrogation
rights, this must be agreed to by the parties
and set forth in writing. (Board Op. at
4-5 (citing <EM>Superior Lawn Care v. Workers'
Comp. Appeal Bd. (Hoffer</EM>), 878 A.2d
936 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2005); <EM>Rissmiller v.
Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (Warminster
Twp.),</EM> 768 A.2d 1212 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2001)).)
As laches cannot apply, and Claimant did
not present an executed agreement whereby
Medical Center agreed not to assert a
subrogation interest, the Board found no
merit in Claimant's arguments.

<P20>The Board similarly found that Claimant's
arguments that Medical Center did
not meet its burden of showing that the
medical malpractice worsened Claimant's
<Page 707>
work injury were without merit. Pointing
to the credited testimony of Dr. Harris,
the Board held that the WCJ's finding in
this regard was supported by substantial
evidence. Because it was undisputed that
Medical Center paid Claimant benefits for
the work injuries and the neurological issues
that resulted from the negligent care
and that the $2.4 million award was for
damages related to that negligent care, the
Board concluded Medical Center established
its entitlement to subrogation. (<EM>Id.</EM>
at 11-12.)

<P20>Claimant next argued the WCJ erred in
denying the Review Petition because Dr.
Harris's opinion that the C4-5 and C5-6
disc hernias were not work-related was not
competent since he was unaware that
Claimant's accepted work injury included
C5-6 radiculopathy. The Board rejected
this argument, noting that the WCJ's decision
to credit Dr. Harris's opinions was not
subject to its review, and there was no
evidence that such decision was arbitrary
and capricious. (<EM>Id.</EM> at 13.) It explained
that the record showed "that Dr. Harris
was well-versed on Claimant's conditions,"
as reflected in his thorough review of
Claimant's diagnostic studies and medical
records. (<EM>Id.</EM>) More importantly, the Board
held, the WCJ did not credit Dr. Sing's
testimony and, therefore, Claimant could
not meet her burden of proving that the
description of her work injuries should be
expanded to include the additional cervical
disc hernias. (<EM>Id.</EM>)

<P20>Finally, Claimant challenged the
denial of litigation costs, noting that she
was successful in part because the WCJ
did expand the description of her work
injury to include a psychological component.
The Board discerned no error in the
WCJ's denial of litigation costs because
the injury added was not a matter at issue
due to Medical Center's acceptance thereof
at the beginning of the litigation and its
payment of the medical costs associated
therewith. Because Claimant did not prevail
on any of the contested issues, the
Board held she was not entitled to litigation
costs. (<EM>Id.</EM> at 14 (citing <EM>Barrett v.
Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (Sunoco,
Inc.),</EM> 987 A.2d 1280 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2010),
<EM>overruled on other grounds by Crocker v.
Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (Georgia Pac.
LLC),</EM> 225 A.3d 1201 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2020)).)
Claimant now petitions this Court for review.<fnr12>, <fnr13>

<HN20><EMB>II. Claimant's Appeal</EMB>

<HN20><EM>A. Modification Petition</EM>

<CN>1. <EMU>General Legal Principles</EMU>

<P20>Section 319 of the WC Act provides,
in relevant part:

<B22><EMB>Where the compensable injury is
caused in whole or in part by the act
or omission of a third party, the employer
shall be subrogated to the right
of the employe</EMB> ... to the extent of the
compensation payable under this article
by the employer; reasonable attorney's
fees and other proper disbursements incurred
in obtaining a recovery or in
effecting a compromise settlement shall
be prorated between the employer and
employe .... The employer shall pay
that proportion of the attorney's fees
<Page 708>
and other proper disbursements that the
amount of compensation paid or payable
at the time of recovery or settlement
bears to the total recovery or settlement.
Any recovery against such third
person in excess of the compensation
theretofore paid by the employer shall
be paid forthwith to the employe, ...
and shall be treated as an advance payment
by the employer on account of any
future instalments of compensation.

<P00>77 P.S. &sect; 671 (emphasis added). Our Supreme
Court has described subrogation
under Section 319 as follows:

<B22>Subrogation in our workers' compensation
system is a significant and firmly
established right. Specifically, while subrogation
is an important equitable concept
that applies whenever a debt or
obligation is paid by one party though
another is primarily liable, ... in the
realm of workers' compensation, it has
assumed even greater stature. <EMB>Our
Court has stated that the statutory
right to subrogation is "absolute and
can be abrogated only by choice."</EMB> ....
This is so because the statute granting
subrogation "clearly and unambiguously"
provides that the employer "shall be
subrogated" to the employee's right of
recovery .... <EMB>Thus, the importance
and strength of subrogation in our
system of workers' compensation cannot
be understated.</EMB>

<B22>Yet, whether an employer is entitled to
subrogation in any given case remains
depend[e]nt upon the statutory provision
that creates this right. Thus, [the court
must consider] the issue of whether the
statutory provision granting subrogation,
Section 319, affords [an employer]
a right to subrogation over monies recovered
by [the claimant] pursuant to a
settlement of [the particular third-party]
action ....

<P00><EM>Brubacher Excavating, Inc. v. Workers'
Comp. Appeal Bd. (Bridges),</EM> 575 Pa. 168,
835 A.2d 1273, 1275-76 (2003) (emphasis
added) (citations omitted). The policy behind
subrogation under the WC Act is to
prevent double recovery for the same injury,
to prevent an employer from having to
pay compensation due to the wrongful acts
of a third party, and to prevent a third
party from escaping liability for its wrongful
conduct. <EM>Poole v. Workers' Comp. Appeal
Bd. (Warehouse Club, Inc.),</EM> 570 Pa.
495, 810 A.2d 1182, 1184 (2002). Whether
an employer is entitled to subrogation is a
question of law based upon the facts as
found by a WCJ. <EM>Griffin v. Workers'
Comp. Appeal Bd. (Thomas Jefferson
Univ. Hosp.),</EM> 745 A.2d 61, 63 n.3 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 1999).

<P20>In determining whether a
WCJ's findings are supported by substantial
evidence,<fnr14> we "consider the evidence
as a whole, view the evidence in the light
most favorable to the party who prevailed
before the WCJ, and draw all reasonable
inferences which are deducible from the
evidence in" that party's favor. <EM>Frog,
Switch & Mfg. Co. v. Workers' Comp. Appeal
Bd. (Johnson),</EM> 106 A.3d 202, 206 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 2014) (quotation omitted). Where
both parties present evidence, it does not
matter if there is evidence that supports a
contrary finding; the only question is
whether there is evidence that supports
the findings that were made. <EM>McCabe v.
Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (Dep't of Revenue),</EM>
806 A.2d 512, 515 (Pa. Cmwlth.
2002). "The WCJ is the ultimate fact finder
and has complete authority for making all
credibility" and evidentiary weight determinations.

<Page 709>
<EM>Bd. (Whitetail Ski Co.),</EM> 812 A.2d 750, 755
(Pa. Cmwlth. 2002). It is well-settled that a
"WCJ may reject the testimony of any
witness in whole or in part, even if that
testimony is uncontradicted." <EM>Hoffmaster
v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (Senco
Prod., Inc.),</EM> 721 A.2d 1152, 1156 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 1998). Where the WCJ is required
to assess the credibility of deposition
testimony, the WCJ must articulate
objective bases for crediting one witness's
deposition testimony over another witness's
deposition testimony. <EM>Daniels v.
Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (Tristate
Transp.),</EM> 574 Pa. 61, 828 A.2d 1043, 1053-54
(2003). In the rare instances where we
review a credibility determination, "[w]e
must view the reasoning as a whole and
overturn the credibility determination only
if it is arbitrary and capricious or so fundamentally
dependent on a misapprehension
of material facts, or so otherwise flawed,
as to render it irrational." <EM>Casne v. Workers'
Comp. Appeal Bd. (Stat Couriers,
Inc.),</EM> 962 A.2d 14, 19 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2008).

<HN02>2. <EMU>Whether Claimant's recovery in the
medical malpractice action was a
"third-party" award subject to subrogation
under Section 319.</EMU>

<P20>On appeal, Claimant argues there can be
no WC subrogation of her civil recovery
pursuant to Section 319 of the WC Act and
the Medical Care Availability and Reduction
of Error (MCARE) Act<fnr15> because
there was no third party involved in the
civil action. Arguing that subrogation is an
equitable doctrine to which equitable principles
apply, <EM>Remy v. Michael D's Carpet
Outlets,</EM> 391 Pa.Super. 436, 571 A.2d 446,
452 (1990), Claimant argues there can be
no subrogation here because an employer
cannot assert subrogation against itself.
Claimant maintains that the identity of her
employer was previously stipulated to in
the 2013 WCJ Decision and was listed on
her NTCP as being Healthcare Network.
(Claimant's Brief (Br.) at 17.) In her view,
this prior identification of Healthcare Network
as her employer precludes further
litigation over that issue pursuant to the
principles of res judicata, which apply in
WC matters. <EM>Weney v. Workers' Comp.
Appeal Bd. (Mac Sprinkler Sys., Inc.),</EM> 960
A.2d 949, 957 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2008). The
import of this conclusion, Claimant asserts,
is that because both Medical Center and
EPPI fall under Healthcare Network's
corporate umbrella, they are not separate
and distinct corporate entities so as to
support the conclusion that there was a
"third party" involved in this matter.
Claimant further argues that while the
WCJ credited HR Director's testimony
that EPPI employed Dr. Lavelle and Dr.
Strain, such testimony was contrary to Dr.
Lavelle's testimony that he was employed
by Healthcare Network, which the WCJ
rejected without elaboration.
<Page 710>

<P20>Medical Center responds that the right
to subrogation under Section 319 is absolute
and it is well settled that a WC defendant
can recover a subrogation reimbursement
from a claimant's civil medical
malpractice action where the treatment
arose out of the claimant's work injury.
Claimant's challenges to the 2017 WCJ
Decision and the Board's affirmance
thereof, Medical Center argues, are really
challenges to the WCJ's credibility determinations.
According to Medical Center,
in continuing to assert that Healthcare
Network is her employer, Claimant is asking
the Court to disregard the WCJ's acceptance
of HR Director's testimony as
credible, testimony that supports the finding
that Medical Center employed Claimant
and EPPI employed Dr. Lavelle and
Dr. Strain. According to Medical Center,
Dr. Lavelle's discovery deposition, which
the WCJ found irrelevant and unpersuasive,
went to Claimant's treatment, not for
whom Dr. Lavelle was employed. Medical
Center points out that even this part of
Dr. Lavelle's testimony was equivocal.
(S.R.R. at 434b, 437b-38b.) Medical Center
argues the NTCP issued and the "pro
forma" 2013 WCJ Decision similarly do
not support Claimant's contention that it
was error for the WCJ to find that Medical
Center was Claimant's employer.
(Medical Center's Br. at 36.) According to
Medical Center, the NTCP accurately listed
Claimant's employer as "Long Term
Structured Residence &mdash; AEHN," (R.R. at
317a), because Claimant worked for a
long-term structured residence when she
was injured. And, Medical Center asserts,
the 2013 WCJ Decision and stipulation
were not the result of litigation and did
not adjudicate what entity employed
Claimant, Dr. Lavelle, and Dr. Strain, but
were related to Claimant's attempt to expand
the description of her work injury.
At that time, Medical Center asserts, the
precise identity of Claimant's employer
was immaterial because Claimant's injury
had already been acknowledged and she
was receiving benefits. Medical Center asserts
the 2013 WCJ Decision and 2013
Stipulation are not res judicata on the
issue to be decided in this matter because
the issue <EMB>decided</EMB> in those proceedings
was not identical to the issue presented in
this case, the identity of Claimant's employer
was <EMB>not fully litigated</EMB> in those
proceedings, and any determination of
who Claimant's employer was, if there was
one, <EMB>was not essential</EMB> to the judgment in
the 2013 WCJ Decision. Thus, Medical
Center asserts, the Board's observation
that there was no evidence supporting the
claim that the corporate entity had not
been previously established was accurate.

<P20>Medical Center further asserts that
Claimant's "no third party" argument is
premised on the contention that distinct,
but related, corporate entities must be
treated as a single corporate entity for
purposes of the WC Act. This, however, is
inaccurate, Medical Center argues, because
in <EM>Kiehl</EM> the Supreme Court held
that, in analyzing the identity of employers
under the WC Act, related corporate entities
retain their individual corporate identities
for liability purposes. Here, Claimant
was employed by Medical Center and Dr.
Lavelle and Dr. Strain were employed by
EPPI, two corporate entities that, while
related, are distinct. As a result, Medical
Center asserts, Claimant was allowed to
bring the civil action against them and
Medical Center was allowed to assert its
subrogation claim against the civil recovery
Claimant received. The WCJ's findings
in this regard are supported by substantial
evidence, HR Director's credited testimony,
and, therefore, Medical Center argues,
Claimant's contentions must be rejected.

<P20>Initially, we note that Claimant's arguments
that her time of injury employer
was Healthcare Network, rather than
<Page 711>
Medical Center, are understandable given
the references to Healthcare Network as
the "employer" on the NTCP and in the
prior proceedings relating to Claimant's
injury. Nonetheless, for the reasons set
forth below, these references do not require
the reversal of the WCJ's finding
that Claimant worked for Medical Center
and not Healthcare Network.

<P20>We first address Claimant's
assertion that the identity of her employer
as Healthcare Network was previously litigated
and resolved and, therefore, that res
judicata precludes the relitigation of that
issue in the present matter. Res judicata
includes two related, but distinct principles:
technical res judicata and collateral
estoppel. For a party "to invoke either
[technical] res judicata or collateral estoppel[,]
the issues presented ... must be the
same as those raised in the instant action."
<EM>Safeguard Mut. Ins. Co. v. Williams,</EM> 463
Pa. 567, 345 A.2d 664, 668 (1975). All of the
elements related to these principles must
be met in order for res judicata to bar the
subsequent litigation. <EM>Armco Steel Corp. v.
Workmen's Comp. Appeal Bd.,</EM> 60 Pa.
Cmwlth. 195, 431 A.2d 363, 365 (1981).

<P20>"Technical res judicata provides
that when a final judgment on the
merits exists, a future suit between the
parties on the same cause of action is
precluded." <EM>Henion v. Workers' Comp. Appeal
Bd. (Firpo & Sons, Inc.),</EM> 776 A.2d
362, 365 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2001). Technical res
judicata, or claim preclusion, applies where
the following is the same: (1) the "identity
of the thing sued upon or for"; (2) the
"identity of the cause of action"; (3) the
"identity of the persons and parties to the
action"; and (4) the "identity of the quality
or capacity of the parties suing or sued."
<EM>Weney,</EM> 960 A.2d at 954 (citation omitted).
"[C]auses of action are identical when the
subject matter and the ultimate issues are
the same in both the old and the new
proceedings." <EM>Henion,</EM> 776 A.2d at 366.
Technical res judicata applies to matters
raised and to those matters that should
have been raised in an earlier proceeding.

Collateral estoppel prevents the relitigation
of an already-decided issue and will
apply in workers' compensation proceedings
when: (1) "the issue in the prior adjudication
was identical to the one presented
in the later action"; (2) "there was a final
judgment on the merits"; (3) "the party
against whom the plea is asserted was a
party or in privity with a party to the prior
adjudication"; (4) "the party against whom
it is asserted has had a full and fair opportunity
to litigate the issue in a prior action";
and (5) "the determination in the
prior proceeding was essential to the judgment."
<EM>Callaghan v. Workers' Comp. Appeal
Bd. (City of Phila.),</EM> 750 A.2d 408, 412
(Pa. Cmwlth. 2000).

<P20>It appears from Claimant's arguments
that she is asserting that collateral estoppel
precludes Healthcare Network and
Medical Center from asserting that an entity
other than Healthcare Network was
Claimant's employer because, she maintains,
that <EMB>issue</EMB> was already litigated and
resolved in the NTCP, the 2013 WCJ Decision,
and 2013 Stipulation. Although this is
a close question because Healthcare Network
was identified as Claimant's employer
in those documents, collateral estoppel
requires that the issue of law or fact to be
foreclosed in subsequent litigation had to
be "<EMB>actually litigated and necessary to a
previous final judgment.</EMB>" <EM>Henion,</EM> 776
A.2d at 365 (emphasis added). Further, the
issues litigated in both proceedings have to
be the same, and the determination on that
<Page 712>
issue had to be essential to the judgment.
<EM>Callaghan,</EM> 750 A.2d at 412. Reviewing
these documents, these requirements were
not satisfied so as to give them preclusive
effect on the matter at issue here: which
corporate entity was Claimant's employer
at the time of her work injury on April 28,
2009.

<P20>The issuance of the NTCP was not the
result of any litigation. Rather, it is a
standard form filed with the WC authorities
through which compensation payments
may be initiated without prejudice and
without admitting liability for a 90-day period
while an employer is uncertain whether
a compensable work injury occurred.
Section 406.1(d) of the WC Act, 77 P.S.
&sect; 717.1(d).<fnr16> Further, the issue litigated
and resolved in the 2013 WCJ Decision
and 2013 Stipulation was not "who" Claimant's
employer was, but "what" Claimant's
work-related injuries should be, and
whether Claimant's benefits could be modified
based on the results of an impairment
rating evaluation (IRE). (R.R. at 15a-20a.)
Notably, the 2013 Stipulation merely identified
Healthcare Network as the employer
in the introductory paragraph and there
was no stipulation to that fact elsewhere in
the document. Therefore, Claimant did not
meet her burden of proving all of the
elements necessary to successfully assert
that the identity of her employer was finally
litigated prior to the current matter so
as to invoke the preclusive effect of collateral
estoppel here. Thus, Medical Center
was not precluded from establishing that
it, rather than Healthcare Network, was
Claimant's employer, which it did through
the credited testimony of HR Director.

<P20>Ultimately, the question of which
entity employed Claimant at the time of
her injury was one of fact for the WCJ to
resolve. Crediting HR Director's testimony,
the WCJ found that Claimant worked
for Medical Center and that Dr. Lavelle
and Dr. Strain were employed by EPPI,
which is a corporate entity separate and
distinct from both Healthcare Network
and Medical Center. The WCJ did not
credit Claimant's own testimony regarding
her employer or the testimony of Dr. Lavelle,
which, Claimant asserts, proves that
Dr. Lavelle was employed by Healthcare
Network. In doing so, the WCJ found Dr.
Lavelle's testimony irrelevant and unpersuasive
given the result of the medical
malpractice action and the credibility of
Medical Center's witnesses. Reviewing
that finding, we cannot say it was "arbitrary
and capricious or so fundamentally
dependent on a misapprehension of material
facts, or so otherwise flawed, as to
render it irrational." <EM>Casne,</EM> 962 A.2d at 19.
Thus, Claimant was employed by Medical
Center, and Dr. Lavelle and Dr. Strain
were employed by EPPI, and these two
corporate entities are subsidiaries of
Healthcare Network. The Court must now
consider how these corporate entities
should be treated for purposes of the WC
Act.

<P20>In <EM>Kiehl,</EM> our Supreme Court addressed
the question of a parent corporation's liability
to employees of a wholly-owned subsidiary
who were injured and brought
negligence actions against the parent corporation.
535 A.2d at 572. The parent corporation
argued it was entitled to immunity,
pursuant to the exclusivity provisions
of the WC Act, from the third-party suits
brought by those employees. The trial
court agreed and entered judgment
against the employees, which the Superior
Court affirmed. On further appeal, the Supreme
Court reversed. In doing so, the
Court held that, for WC purposes, "where
a parent/subsidiary relationship is established[,]
the question of which corporation
<Page 713>
has control over an employee is determined
by focusing on the functions performed
by each corporation and by the
employee in addition to other indicia of
control." <EM>Id.</EM> at 573 (emphasis omitted).
Reviewing the functions of the parent corporation
and subsidiary corporation, as
well as the functions of the employees of
the subsidiary corporation, in <EM>Kiehl,</EM> the
Supreme Court explained that "[t]he operational
functions" of each corporation and
its employees were "distinct" and they
had separate corporate existences. <EM>Id.</EM> at
574. Thus, in Pennsylvania, the Supreme
Court concluded, "a parent corporation
and its subsidiary must be regarded as
separate entities in regards to the [WC]
Act." <EM>Id.</EM> Therefore, the parent corporation
in <EM>Kiehl</EM> had to be treated as a separate
entity from its subsidiary corporation
and was not entitled to rely on the latter's
WC immunity to shield itself from liability
in the third-party actions.

<P20>Although Claimant's appeal does not involve
a parent corporation seeking to invoke
the immunity protection of a subsidiary
corporation, the Supreme Court's
holding that these two corporate entities
must be regarded as separate is equally
applicable here. Here, Claimant asserts
there is no "third party" in her medical
malpractice action because it was her employer
that paid to settle that action. This
argument assumes either that Claimant
and Drs. Lavelle and Strain were all employed
by Healthcare Network or that,
because EPPI and Medical Center fall under
Healthcare Network's umbrella, they
are all essentially the same corporation.
First, as discussed above, per HR Director's
credited testimony, EPPI employed
Dr. Lavelle and Dr. Strain and
Medical Center employed Claimant.
Therefore, the first assumption is not applicable.

<P20>The second assumption is contrary to
the Supreme Court's holding in <EM>Kiehl</EM> and
the WCJ's factual findings, based on HR
Director's credited testimony, that EPPI,
Healthcare Network, and Medical Center
are separate corporate entities. (R.R. at
551a-52a.) HR Director testified that neither
EPPI nor Medical Center owned or
had financial control over the other, and
their employees are not within the same
chain of command. (<EM>Id.</EM> at 553a-54a, 556a-60a.)
According to HR Director, EPPI and
the Medical Center serve different purposes
within the Healthcare Network. (<EM>Id.</EM>
at 572a.) HR Director's testimony referred
to Healthcare Network as an umbrella entity
for marketing purposes and when
asked whether Healthcare Network owned
or had a financial interest in these subsidiaries,
she responded that she was "not
aware that it does." (<EM>Id.</EM> at 571a-72a.)
Nonetheless, HR Director's credited testimony
established that Healthcare Network
is used to market the various services provided
by the subsidiary corporations,
which is a different function than those
provided by the subsidiary corporations.
Thus, <EM>Kiehl</EM> applies here and requires each
of these corporate entities to be treated as
separate entities for the purposes of the
WC Act. <EM>Kiehl,</EM> 535 A.2d at 574. As such,
Claimant's argument that there was no
"third-party" recovery from which Section
319 subrogation could be taken fails.<fnr17>

<HN02>3. <EMU>Whether the Section 319 subrogation
claim is waived and/or barred by res
judicata or the doctrine of laches.</EMU>

<P20>Claimant alternatively argues that, even
if there was a potential right to subrogation,
<Page 714>
the right was waived because Medical
Center did not preserve that right prior to
the 2013 WCJ Decision. Citing the fact
that Healthcare Network, Medical Center,
and EPPI were all parties to the final
release in the civil action, Claimant contends
Medical Center was aware that it
may have a right to subrogation against
Claimant's medical malpractice award but
did not take action to assert or protect
that right when it signed the stipulation in
2013. Rather, it waited until December
2014 to assert and pursue its subrogation
claim, which Claimant argues was not a
prompt assertion of that interest and prevents
the grant of the Modification Petition
pursuant to <EM>Liberty Mutual Insurance
Company v. Excalibur Management
Services,</EM> 81 A.3d 1024 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2013).
Therefore, Claimant asserts that the subrogation
claim is barred either by the principles
of res judicata or the doctrine of
laches.<fnr18>

<P20>Medical Center responds that Claimant's
arguments that its subrogation claim
is waived or somehow barred are without
merit. First, it points out that <EM>Liberty
Mutual Insurance</EM> is distinguishable. That
matter involved a subrogation claim under
the second paragraph of Section 319,<fnr19>
which applies to situations where a non-workers'
compensation insurer initially
pays disability and/or medical benefits to
the injured worker, and that insurer is
seeking to subrogate after it is determined
that the injury was work related. This
matter involves subrogation under the first
paragraph of Section 319 making Claimant's
reliance on <EM>Liberty Mutual Insurance</EM>
misplaced. Second, contrary to Claimant's
assertions, Medical Center maintains
laches and other equitable principles do
not apply to subrogation claims under the
first paragraph of Section 319 and claims
delayed for periods longer than the 18
months at issue here have been allowed
because the right to subrogation is absolute.
<EM>Young v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd.
(Chubb Corp.),</EM> 88 A.3d 295, 302 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 2014); <EM>Superior Lawn Care,</EM> 878
A.2d at 941. Medical Center further notes
that it first began asserting its subrogation
<Page 715>
claim in 2013. (Medical Center's Br. at 45
n.13.) Medical Center argues that when it
filed the current Modification Petition,
Claimant challenged any modification of
her benefits from the beginning on the
basis that the MCARE Act eliminated WC
subrogation for medical practice recoveries,
a conclusion rejected by this Court in
<EM>Protz v. Workers' Compensation Appeal
Board (Derry Area School District),</EM> 131
A.3d 572 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016). (Medical
Center's Br. at 44.) Third, Medical Center
asserts that the only legally effective
means for an employer to waive its right to
subrogation is by executing a written document
expressly waiving that right. <EM>Rissmiller,</EM>
768 A.2d at 1213. Because it has
not executed such a waiver, Medical Center
argues, there has been no waiver of its
subrogation rights. Finally, Claimant's reliance
on <EM>Weney</EM> and her assertion that
Medical Center did not preserve its subrogation
claim during the pendency of the
review petitions resolved in the 2013 WCJ
Decision are misplaced because neither involved
the issue of subrogation. <EM>Weney</EM>
involved a situation where a claimant was
attempting to relitigate the nature and
extent of her work injury, which had been
resolved in a prior review petition, a violation
of the principle of res judicata. Medical
Center maintains no such attempt to
relitigate has occurred here.

<P20>Pursuant to the plain language of
Section 319, which provides that an employer
"shall be subrogated," 77 P.S. &sect; 671,
subrogation is "automatic" and "by its
terms, <EMB>admits of no express exceptions,
equitable or otherwise.</EMB>" <EM>Thompson v.
Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (USF&G),</EM> 566
Pa. 420, 781 A.2d 1146, 1151 (2001) (emphasis
added). Thus, our Supreme Court
has held that, generally, <EMB>the right to subrogation
is</EMB> "<EMB>statutorily absolute and can
be abrogated only by choice.</EMB>" <EM>Id.</EM> at 1152
(quoting <EM>Winfree v. Phila. Elec. Co.,</EM> 520
Pa. 392,554 A.2d 485, 487 (1989)) (emphasis
added).<fnr20> In <EM>Superior Lawn Care,</EM> 878 A.2d
at 941, this Court rejected a claimant's
assertion of the doctrine of laches as an
affirmative defense to an employer's subrogation
claim, citing <EM>Thompson.</EM> Section
319 does not provide a time limitation for
an employer to assert a subrogation claim.
<EM>Peeples v. Workmen's Comp. Appeal Bd.
(Foster Wheeler Energy Corp.),</EM> 133 Pa.
Cmwlth. 559, 576 A.2d 1190, 1191 (1990)
(rejecting a claimant's assertion that the
employer's right to subrogation was
waived because it was asserted three or
four years after the third-party recovery).

<P20>It is undisputed that Medical
Center has not expressly waived its right
to subrogation by executing an agreement
releasing that right. Accordingly, we address
Claimant's laches and res judicata
arguments as bases for finding that Medical
Center's assertion of its subrogation
interest is barred. Claimant's argument
that Medical Center's subrogation claim is
barred by the doctrine of laches is contrary
to our settled case law that laches, as
well as equitable principles in general, are
inapplicable to subrogation claims. <EM>Thompson,</EM>
781 A.2d at 1151; <EM>Young,</EM> 88 A.3d at
302-03; <EM>Superior Lawn Care,</EM> 878 A.2d at
941. Further, as Medical Center points
out, <EM>Liberty Mutual Insurance</EM> did not
involve the type of subrogation claim at
issue here, and, therefore, does not support
Claimant's assertion that Medical
Center lost its right to assert its subrogation
interest. The insurer in <EM>Liberty Mutual
Insurance</EM> asserted a subrogation interest
<Page 716>
under the second paragraph of Section
319, which is not absolute, unlike subrogation
under the first paragraph. <EM>Thompson,</EM>
781 A.2d at 1151. Subrogation under the
second paragraph of Section 319 is not
self-executing and, therefore, must be asserted
with reasonable diligence. <EM>Liberty
Mutual Insurance,</EM> 81 A.3d at 1027. Subrogation
under the second paragraph of Section
319 must be established by either
contract (by the agreement of the parties)
or litigation (established during a WC
hearing), and, if there is no contract, the
insurer must establish its right to subrogation
at a hearing before a WCJ or the
Board. <EM>Id.</EM> Because subrogation under the
first paragraph is at issue here, <EM>Liberty
Mutual Insurance</EM> does not apply. As we
explained in <EM>Peeples,</EM> the first paragraph of
Section 319 does not impose a time limitation
on an employer's filing of a subrogation
claim. Thus, the 18-month delay between
the settlement of Claimant's third-party
action and Medical Center's filing of
the Modification Petition does not bar
Medical Center's subrogation rights.

<P20>As for Claimant's assertion that
res judicata bars the Modification Petition
because Medical Center did not "preserve"
its subrogation rights because it did not
assert its subrogation rights in the prior
proceedings that led to the 2013 WCJ Decision,
we note Claimant does not cite to
any precedent applying res judicata as a
bar to an employer's claim for subrogation
under Section 319, and our own research
has not revealed any. <EM>See Hill v. Workmen's
Comp. Appeal Bd. (J.F. Judski Assocs.),</EM>
117 Pa.Cmwlth. 540, 543 A.2d 1279,
1281 (1988) (finding no merit in a claimant's
assertion that collateral estoppel
barred an employer's Section 319 subrogation
claim). <EM>Weney,</EM> cited by Claimant, did
not involve subrogation, but the filing of
multiple review petitions through which a
claimant sought to litigate, and then relitigate,
the nature and extent of her work
injury. In <EM>Superior Lawn Care,</EM> we rejected
the claimant's attempt to use non-subrogation
case law to incorporate equitable
principles to limit an employer's absolute
right to subrogation. 878 A.2d at 941-42.
We must, therefore, do the same here. Our
Supreme Court has expressed that the
only limits to an employer's <EMB>absolute right</EMB>
to subrogation under Section 319 of the
WC Act are where the employer limits
that right by consent or where the employer
engages in deliberate, bad faith conduct
that subverts a claimant's third-party suit,
<EM>Thompson,</EM> 781 A.2d at 1151, 1154. Because
res judicata does not fall within either
of these narrow limitations, under our
precedent, it is not a defense that can
defeat an employer's absolute right to subrogation
under the WC Act.

<HN02>4. <EMU>Whether Medical Center met its burden
of proving the existence of medical
malpractice that worsened Claimant's
condition.</EMU>

<P20>Finally, Claimant maintains that there
was no independent evidence that Dr. Lavelle
and Dr. Strain actually committed
medical malpractice and the evidence presented,
the verdict sheet and high-low arbitration
agreement, did not meet Medical
Center's burden of proving that medical
malpractice occurred. More importantly,
Claimant argues, the evidence that was
presented to establish that the medical
malpractice worsened Claimant's condition,
Dr. Harris's opinion, did not include an
opinion that Claimant would have sufficiently
recovered had it not been for the
malpractice or that Medical Center had to
pay greater compensation benefits due to
the malpractice than it would have had to
pay with the initial work injury. Without
such evidence, Claimant asserts, the Modification
Petition should have been denied.
<Page 717>

<P20>Medical Center responds that it has no
obligation to prove that negligence occurred
to establish its entitlement to subrogation
against a claimant's third-party
recovery. Even if it had to do so, Medical
Center asserts that the negligence of Dr.
Lavelle and Dr. Strain had already been
established in the civil verdict sheet of the
arbitrator, which found that both doctors
had been negligent in their treatment of
Claimant. As for Claimant's assertion that
Medical Center's evidence did not support
the grant of subrogation, Medical Center
points out that Dr. Harris, credited by the
WCJ, testified that the actions of Dr. Lavelle
and Dr. Strain did cause Claimant to
develop the neurological conditions that
cause her continuing impairments and
need for medical treatment and that, absent
the negligence of those physicians,
Claimant would have experienced a complete
or near complete recovery. (R.R. at
33b-36b.) Such credited evidence, Medical
Center argues, satisfied its burden of proving
its entitlement to subrogation under
Section 319. Dr. Sing's contrary testimony,
Medical Center argues, attempted to establish
that no medical malpractice occurred
on April 29, 2009, notwithstanding
Claimant's $2.4 million recovery for that
medical malpractice in her civil action.

<P20>Where, as here, the negligent
conduct occurs subsequent to the original
injury, an employer seeking subrogation of
a third-party recovery based on that negligence
"must show that it was compelled to
make payments by reason of the negligence
of a third-party, and that the fund to
which it seeks subrogation was for the
same compensable injury for which it is
liable under the Act." <EM>Griffin,</EM> 745 A.2d at
64. To establish that it "was compelled to
make compensation payments as result of
the negligen[ce]," an employer has to
show, by clear and convincing evidence,
that but for the negligence, the claimant
would have been employable again. <EM>Id.</EM> at
64-65. However, "no formal adjudication of
the third party's negligence [is] required"
to establish an employer's right to subrogation.
<EM>Hill,</EM> 543 A.2d at 1281.

<P20>Claimant's arguments reflect a
challenge to whether the WCJ's findings of
fact are supported by substantial evidence.
A review of the evidence proffered by
Medical Center, and credited by the WCJ,
reveals that those findings are supported
and, therefore, are binding on the Court.
We agree with Medical Center that, even if
it had to establish that Dr. Lavelle and Dr.
Strain did commit medical malpractice,
this fact was proven not only by the verdict
sheet reflecting that both physicians
were negligent in their medical treatment
of Claimant, but also by the credited expert
testimony of Dr. Harris. In that testimony,
Dr. Harris opined that the 48-hour
delay in Claimant having the surgery "had
a drastic impact on her ultimate neurological
outcome ... that lead to ultimately
irreversible neurological disability that
could have been prevented had she been
diagnosed ... sooner." (S.R.R. at 33b-34b.)
In short, Dr. Harris opined that, as a
result of the acts of Dr. Lavelle and Dr.
Strain in not diagnosing Claimant earlier,
Claimant's spinal cord compression continued
to worsen, causing her to develop severe
neurologic symptoms, an "irreversible
spinal cord injury," and an "irreversible
neurological disability." (<EM>Id.</EM> at 34b, 36b-37b.)

<P20>Dr. Harris's credited opinions also
support the WCJ's determination that
Medical Center had met its burden of
proving its entitlement to subrogation under
Section 319. Contrary to Claimant's
arguments, Dr. Harris opined that had
Claimant undergone surgery to resolve the
spinal cord compression within two or
three hours of initial presentation, "[h]er
outcome would have been dramatically better
<Page 718>
than it ultimately turned out to be."
(<EM>Id.</EM> at 34b.) In Dr. Harris's opinion, Claimant
"would likely have had either a complete
or nearly complete recovery," and
Claimant "would very likely have had an
excellent recovery and would have been
able to return to work." (<EM>Id.</EM> at 34b-35b.)
Dr. Harris explained that Claimant's "deficits
... developed as a result of persistent
progressive spinal cord compression" and
"[h]ad that spinal cord compression been
relieved by having the discs removed and
the spinal cord compression alleviated early
on, those subsequent progressive deficits
would never have occurred." (<EM>Id.</EM> at
37b-38b.) Reviewing this credited testimony
in the light most favorable to Medical
Center as the prevailing party, <EM>Frog,
Switch & Manufacturing,</EM> 106 A.3d at 206,
a reasonable mind would accept it as sufficient
to support the conclusions that Medical
Center was "compelled to make payments
by reason of the negligence of a
third[]party, ... that the fund to which it
seeks subrogation was for the same compensable
injury for which it is liable under
the Act," and that but for the negligence,
Claimant would have been employable
again. <EM>Griffin,</EM> 745 A.2d at 64-65. Accordingly,
we cannot say it was error for the
WCJ to find that Medical Center met its
burden of proving its entitlement to subrogation
under Section 319.

<HN20><EM>B. Review Petition</EM>

<P20>Claimant argues that Dr. Sing's
testimony supported the grant of the Review
Petition and that the WCJ erred in
accepting Dr. Harris's contrary testimony
because "it is clear that [Dr. Harris's]
testimony did not have an adequate basis
in fact" and was, therefore, incompetent as
a matter of law. (Claimant's Br. at 12, 26.)
According to Claimant, Dr. Harris believed
that Claimant's work injury consisted only
of injuries to the C6-7 disc, which is contrary
to the 2013 WCJ Decision reflecting
that the work injury also included radiculopathy
at C5-6.

<P20>Medical Center responds that the WCJ
gave multiple reasons for not accepting
Dr. Sing's medical opinions, including that
Dr. Sing did not review any of the CT or
MRI films himself, relying only on the
reports of those studies. Further, Medical
Center asserts, Dr. Harris reviewed the
films themselves, and he opined that the
changes to the discs at C4-5 and C5-6
already existed at the time of the 2009
work injury and were unrelated to that
injury or Claimant's April 30, 2009 surgery.
Medical Center contends that the
WCJ, acting in his role as fact finder,
credited its competent evidence and did
not credit Claimant's evidence and, therefore,
did not err in denying the Review
Petition.

<P20>Section 413(a) of the WC Act provides
that

<B22>A [WCJ] ... may, at any time, review
and modify or set aside a[n NCP] ...
upon petition filed by either party with
the department, or in the course of the
proceedings under any petition pending
before such [WCJ], if it be proved that
such [NCP] ... was in any material
respect incorrect ...."

<P00>77 P.S. &sect; 771. The burden of proof on a
review petition seeking to add injuries is
the same as a claim petition. <EM>Commercial
Credit Claims v. Workers' Comp. Appeal
Bd. (Lancaster),</EM> 556 Pa. 325, 728 A.2d 902,
906 (1999). Therefore, the claimant bears
the burden of proving, among other things,
that additional injury was caused by the
claimant's work. <EM>Inglis House v. Workmen's
Comp. Appeal Bd. (Reedy),</EM> 535 Pa.
135, 634 A.2d 592, 595 (1993).

<P20>As set forth above, the WCJ is
the ultimate fact finder and is free to
accept or reject, in whole or in part, the
testimony of any witness, including medical
<Page 719>
witnesses. <EM>Rife,</EM> 812 A.2d at 755; <EM>Hoffmaster,</EM>
721 A.2d at 1156. The WCJ's determination
of evidentiary weight and
credibility is not subject to appellate review.
<EM>Greenwich Collieries v. Workmen's
Comp. Appeal Bd. (Buck),</EM> 664 A.2d 703,
706 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1995). The competency of
a medical witness, however, is a question
of law subject to this Court's review. <EM>Amandeo
v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (Conagra
Foods),</EM> 37 A.3d 72, 80 (Pa. Cmwlth.
2012). "Where an expert's opinion is based
on an assumption that is contrary to the
established facts of record, that opinion is
[incompetent]." <EM>Taylor v. Workers' Comp.
Appeal Bd. (Servistar Corp.),</EM> 883 A.2d
710, 713 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2005). But an expert
opinion is not made "incompetent unless it
is <EMB>solely</EMB> based on inaccurate or false information."
<EM>Namani v. Workers' Comp. Appeal
Bd. (A. Duie Pyle),</EM> 32 A.3d 850, 854
(Pa. Cmwlth. 2011) (quoting <EM>Am. Contracting
Enters., Inc. v. Workers' Comp. Appeal
Bd. (Hurley),</EM> 789 A.2d 391, 396 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 2001)) (emphasis in original). In
making this determination, the Court must
review the witness's testimony as a whole,
and the witness's opinion will not be rendered
incompetent unless it was dependent
on the inaccurate information. <EM>Namani,</EM> 32
A.3d at 854-55.

<P20>Initially, we note that the WCJ did not
credit Dr. Sing's expert opinion that
Claimant sustained the C4-5 and C5-6 disc
hernias as a result of either the original
work injury or the April 30, 2009 surgery.
(FOF &para; 19.) Among the reasons the WCJ
gave for not crediting Dr. Sing's testimony
was that his opinions were based entirely
on the reports of other doctors,
rather than reviewing the actual films of
Claimant's diagnostic tests. (<EM>Id.</EM>) Absent
Claimant presenting credited evidence,
she cannot prevail in meeting her burden
of establishing that the NCP is materially
incorrect. However, to the extent the
WCJ did not credit Dr. Sing's testimony
because Dr. Harris was more credible, we
will review Dr. Harris's testimony to determine
whether, as Claimant contends, it
was not legally competent.

<P20>A review of Dr. Harris's testimony as a
whole reveals that his opinions were based
on his examination of Claimant's medical
records and the actual diagnostic studies
taken of Claimant's cervical spine over the
years. From his review of those studies
and records, Dr. Harris opined that the
alleged disc hernias Claimant sought to
add to the NCP were not work related and
had nothing "to do with her current condition."
(R.R. at 160a-61a.) Based on his
assessment of the 2016 MRI film itself,
rather than just the report relied upon by
Dr. Sing, Dr. Harris found no disc herniation
at C5-6, but did observe disc protrusions
at C4-5 and C5-6. (FOF &para; 12; R.R. at
160a-61a.) However, Dr. Harris opined
those changes were degenerative in nature,
could be observed in Claimant's prior
MRIs, including the one taken on April 30,
2009, and were not related to Claimant's
April 30, 2009 surgery. (R.R. at 161a.)
According to Dr. Harris, there was no
change in Claimant's C5-6 disc between
the April 30, 2009 MRI and 2016 MRI and,
to the extent there was a change to C4-5,
"it would [not] be unexpected that seven
years later there is disc protrusion there[]
because ... degenerative disc disease does
tend to progress over[] time ...." (<EM>Id.</EM>)
While Claimant's accepted work injury includes
right C5-6 and C6-7 radiculopathy,
(FOF &para; 4), and Dr. Harris did indicate that
Claimant's 2009 injury was to her C6-7
disc and that the injury to that disc and its
treatment was the cause of all of her problems
ever since, (R.R. at 161a), we do not
view Dr. Harris's statement as rendering
his testimony incompetent. Dr. Harris's
opinion that the C4-5 and C5-6 injuries
were not work related was not based on
his belief that the work injury involved
<Page 720>
only the C6-7 disc. Rather, it was Dr.
Harris's independent and expert examination
of the actual films of Claimant's MRIs,
and his understanding of the progressive
nature of degenerative disc disease, that
formed the basis of his expert opinion.
This opinion was corroborated by Dr.
Pinsk, who likewise opined that Claimant's
initial CT scan and MRI in April 2009
showed preexisting degenerative changes
at these levels. (<EM>Id.</EM> at 577a-78a.) Therefore,
Dr. Harris's opinion was not based
solely on the alleged inaccurate information
and, accordingly, his opinion was not
incompetent as a matter of law and the
WCJ could rely upon it to reject Dr. Sing's
conflicting testimony. <EM>Namani,</EM> 32 A.3d at
854. Because Claimant's evidence was not
credited, she could not meet her burden of
proof on the Review Petition.

<HN20><EM>C. Litigation Costs</EM>

<P20>Claimant argues that the WCJ
erred in not awarding litigation costs because
she prevailed on her request, set
forth in the Review Petition, to expand her
work injury to include a psychological injury.
Claimant notes that, despite Medical
Center's admission that she sustained this
injury, it did not issue any official document
accepting that injury. Therefore,
Claimant contends, she still had to litigate
this issue before the WCJ. Claimant maintains
that, because the WCJ added this
injury after the litigation, she prevailed "in
part" in her litigation, and she is entitled
to the payment of her litigation costs under
Section 440(a) of the WC Act, 77 P.S.
&sect; 996(a).<fnr21>

<P20>Medical Center argues that because the
WCJ did not err in denying the Review
Petition or in granting the Modification
Petition, Claimant did not prevail on any
contested issue and was not entitled to
litigation costs under the WC Act. Medical
Center asserts that the litigation costs
Claimant incurred, which primarily were
related to Dr. Sing's examination and deposition,
were to establish that the claimed
additional cervical injuries were work related
and to contest the Modification Petition.
Because Claimant did not prevail on
either of those issues, Medical Center argues
there was no error in denying litigation
costs.

<P20>Section 440(a) of the WC Act provides,
in relevant part, that

<B22>[i]n any contested case where the insurer
has contested liability in whole or in
part, ... the employe or [her] dependent,
as the case may be, in whose favor
the matter at issue has been finally determined
in whole or in part shall be
awarded, in addition to the award of
compensation, a reasonable sum for
costs incurred ....

<P00>77 P.S. &sect; 996(a). However, in order to be
awarded litigation costs, the "claimant
must prevail <EMB>on the contested issue.</EMB>"
<EM>Jones v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (Steris
Corp.),</EM> 874 A.2d 717, 721 (Pa. Cmwlth.
2005) (emphasis added).

<P20>Here, Claimant's litigation efforts
sought to expand the definition of her
work injury to include both additional cervical
injuries and a psychological injury
and to challenge Medical Center's Modification
Petition. While Medical Center contested
Claimant's attempt to add the C4-5
and C5-6 disc hernias to her work injury,
it did not contest the existence of the
psychological injury and, in fact, had been
paying for Claimant's medical treatment
for the psychological injury. As a result of
Medical Center's admission, the WCJ added
the uncontested psychological injury to
Claimant's NCP without Claimant ever
having to present evidence to establish
that her psychological injury was work
<Page 721>
related. Contrarily, the WCJ did not find
that Claimant established that the disc
hernias at C4-5 and C5-6 were work related
because he did not credit Dr. Sing's
opinions, thereby precluding Claimant
from meeting her burden of proof on the
only contested issue. Further, Claimant
was unsuccessful in defending against the
Modification Petition. Because Claimant
did not prevail on the only contested issue
in the Review Petition or on her contest of
the Modification Petition, we cannot say
the Board and the WCJ erred in denying
the reimbursement of Claimant's litigation
costs. <EM>Id.</EM>

<HN20><EMB>III. Conclusion</EMB>

<P20>For the foregoing reasons, we discern
no error in the Board's affirmance of the
WCJ's grant of the Modification Petition,
denial of the Review Petition, and denial of
Claimant's request for litigation costs. Accordingly,
we affirm.

<CN><EMBU>ORDER</EMBU>

<P20><EMB>NOW,</EMB> July 15, 2020, the Order of the
Workers' Compensation Appeal Board, entered
in the above-captioned matter, is
<EMB>AFFIRMED.</EMB>
<FN>
<fnt1> Medical Center is a corporate subsidiary of
the Albert Einstein Healthcare Network. As
discussed <EM>infra,</EM> there is a dispute as to which
of these entities is Claimant's employer. However,
we refer to Medical Center here and
throughout the opinion because it was the
entity that filed the Modification Petition and
was found by the WCJ to be Claimant's employer.

<fnt2> Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, <EM>as amended,</EM>
77 P.S. &sect; 671.

<fnt3> To obtain subrogation reimbursement due
to the commission of medical malpractice
during the treatment of a claimant's work-related
injury, an employer must show that
the claimant's work injury worsened due to
the third party's negligence, the employer is
paying benefits for the claimant's condition,
and the funds that the claimant recovered
from the third-party action were for the same
conditions for which the employer is paying
benefits. <EM>Griffin v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd.
(Thomas Jefferson Univ. Hosp.),</EM> 745 A.2d 61,
63-64 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1999).

<fnt4> Pursuant to Section 413(a) of the WC Act,
77 P.S. &sect; 771, a claimant seeking to amend an
NCP based on an incorrect description of a
work-related injury must show either that
when the NCP was issued there was a material
mistake of fact or law made, or that consequential
injuries have developed as a result of
the initial work injuries. <EM>Cinram Mfg., Inc. v.
Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (Hill),</EM> 601 Pa. 524,
975 A.2d 577 (2009).

<fnt5> Dr. Harris testified on April 27, 2016, and
the transcript from that deposition is found at
pages 16b-45b of the supplemental reproduced
record and is summarized in finding of
fact 10.

<fnt6> Dr. Sing's deposition testimony is found at
pages 416a-92a of the reproduced record and
is summarized in finding of fact 11.

<fnt7> Dr. Harris's second deposition was taken on
August 26, 2016. The transcript of that deposition
is found at pages 157a-63a of the reproduced
record and is summarized in finding of
fact 12.

<fnt8> Dr. Pinsk's deposition testimony is found at
pages 575a-81a of the reproduced record and
is summarized in finding of fact 13.

<fnt9> HR Director's deposition testimony is found
at pages 545a-72a of the reproduced record
and is summarized in finding of fact 14.

<fnt10> Claimant's deposition testimony is found at
pages 1a-10a of the reproduced record, and
her testimony from a June 21, 2016 hearing is
found at pages 80b-115b of the supplemental
reproduced record. Claimant's testimony is
summarized in findings of fact 15 and 16.

<fnt11> This finding states, conflictingly, that Dr.
Sing did review and did not review the films.
However, given the evidence and the WCJ's
other findings, this appears merely to be a
typographical error and the first reference to
Dr. Sing was intended to be Dr. Pinsk.

<fnt12> Our review in WC matters "is limited to a
determination of whether constitutional rights
were violated, errors of law were committed,
or the necessary findings were supported by
substantial, competent evidence." <EM>Griffin,</EM> 745
A.2d at 63 n.3.

<fnt13> By Memorandum Opinion and Order dated
July 9, 2019, a single judge of this Court
denied Claimant's Petition for Supersedeas
following telephone argument during which
the parties agreed to maintain the status quo.
<EM>Griffis v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (Albert
Einstein Healthcare Network)</EM> (Pa. Cmwlth.,
No. 272 C.D. 2019, filed July 9, 2019).

<fnt14> "Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence
as a reasonable mind might accept as
adequate to support a conclusion." <EM>City of
Philadelphia v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd.
(Kriebel),</EM> 612 Pa. 6, 29 A.3d 762, 769 (2011).

<fnt15> Act of March 20, 2002, P.L. 154, <EM>as amended,</EM>
40 P.S. &sect;&sect; 1303.101-1303.910. The Pennsylvania
Association For Justice has filed an
amicus curiae brief asserting that the MCARE
Act prohibits an employer from asserting any
claim for subrogation of either past or future
WC benefits paid under Section 319 of the
WC Act. The Pennsylvania Association For
Justice further asserts that Healthcare Network
is Claimant's employer and its right to
subrogation under the WC Act was waived
here because it was not asserted during the
litigation in the prior proceedings. While the
second argument addresses an issue specifically
raised by Claimant in this case, the first
argument, as well as other arguments regarding
the MCARE Act prohibiting any subrogation,
relate to two consolidated petitions for
review involving the same parties, argument
on which was heard on the same day as this
matter, <EM>Griffis v. Workers' Compensation Appeal
Board (Albert Einstein Medical Center),</EM>
___ A.3d ___, 2020 WL 14021926 (Pa.
Cmwlth., Nos. 273, 280 C.D. 2019, filed July
15, 2020).

<fnt16> Section 406.1 was added by Section 3 of
the Act of February 8, 1972, P.L. 25.

<fnt17> Medical Center also argues, in the alternative,
that the injuries Claimant sustained as a
result of her treatment in the Emergency
Room did not arise in the course and scope of
her employment, as she was being treated as
a member of the general public and like any
other member of the paying public. (Medical
Center's Br. at 40 n.12.) Because of our disposition,
we need not reach this issue.

<fnt18> The Pennsylvania Association For Justice
likewise asserts that the subrogation claim is
waived due to the untimely assertion of those
rights. (Amicus Curiae's Br. at 22-25.)

<fnt19> Section 319 provides in its entirety:

<B22>Where the compensable injury is caused in
whole or in part by the act or omission of a
third party, the employer shall be subrogated
to the right of the employe, his personal
representative, his estate or his dependents,
against such third party to the extent of the
compensation payable under this article by
the employer; reasonable attorney's fees
and other proper disbursements incurred
in obtaining a recovery or in effecting a
compromise settlement shall be prorated
between the employer and employe, his
personal representative, his estate or his
dependents. The employer shall pay that
proportion of the attorney's fees and other
proper disbursements that the amount of
compensation paid or payable at the time
of recovery or settlement bears to the total
recovery or settlement. Any recovery
against such third person in excess of the
compensation theretofore paid by the employer
shall be paid forthwith to the employe,
his personal representative, his estate
or his dependents, and shall be treated
as an advance payment by the employer on
account of any future instalments of compensation.

<B22>Where an employe has received payments
for the disability or medical expense resulting
from an injury in the course of his
employment paid by the employer or an
insurance company on the basis that the
injury and disability were not compensable
under this act in the event of an agreement
or award for that injury the employer or
insurance company who made the payments
shall be subrogated out of the agreement
or award to the amount so paid, if the
right to subrogation is agreed to by the
parties or is established at the time of hearing
before the referee or the board.

<P00>77 P.S. &sect; 671.

<fnt20> There is a narrow exception to this principle
where an employer or workers' compensation
insurer engages in deliberate, bad faith
conduct that subverts a claimant's third-party
suit, <EM>Thompson,</EM> 781 A.2d at 1154, but there
are no allegations of such conduct in the
matter <EM>sub judice.</EM>

<P20>OPINION BY <dgn>JUDGE</dgn> <author>WALLACE</author>.
[MT]
<P20>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
(Commonwealth) appeals from the order of
the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny
County (trial court), entered on December
23, 2020, granting Bethel Cemetery's
(Cemetery) Petition to Exonerate Taxes
(Petition). Upon review, we vacate the trial
court's order and remand this matter to
the trial court to quash the Cemetery's
Petition.

<CN><EMB>I. Background</EMB>

<P20>The Cemetery historically operated its
cemetery on real estate that the Bethel
Presbyterian Church (Church) of Bethel
Park, Pennsylvania, owned. Reproduced
Record (R.R.) at 5. By Deed dated December
20, 2018, the Church conveyed title to
this real estate to the Cemetery. <EM>Id.</EM> The
Church attached a Realty Transfer Tax
Statement of Value to this Deed, asserting
the transfer was excluded from Pennsylvania
Realty Transfer Tax as a transfer between
religious organizations under Section
1102-C.3(17) of the Tax Reform Code
of 1971 (Code).<fnr1> R.R. at 5-6. Nevertheless,
on May 10, 2019, the Pennsylvania Department
of Revenue (Department) sent the
Church an assessment imposing realty
transfer taxes in the total amount of
$1,098.27. <EM>Id.</EM> at 3.

<P20>The Church did not file an appeal of the
Department's assessment until August 29,
2019. <EM>Id.</EM> The Department's Board of Appeals
dismissed the Church's appeal because
the Church filed it 51 days after the
<Page 723>
filing deadline. <EM>Id.</EM> The Church appealed to
the Board of Finance and Revenue
(Board), which determined the Church did
not present "facts or evidence sufficient to
demonstrate an administrative breakdown
to allow this Board to overcome the time
limits for filing." <EM>Id.</EM> at 4. As a result, the
Board dismissed the Church's appeal as
untimely by order entered January 29,
2020. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>The Church did not appeal the Board's
decision to this Court. Rather, it was the
Cemetery, nearly 10 months after the
Board dismissed the Church's appeal,<fnr2>
which filed the Petition with the trial
court. <EM>See</EM> R.R. at 5-7. In the Petition, the
Cemetery asserted it exhausted its administrative
remedies regarding the Department's
assessment of realty transfer taxes.
<EM>See id.</EM> at 6. In addition, the Cemetery
requested the trial court "issue an order
declaring that the subject property is exempt
from realty transfer taxes, exonerat[e]
all back taxes owed as against the
Cemetery and void[] the [Department's
assessment]." <EM>Id.</EM> The Cemetery's certificate
of service avers the Cemetery served
the Petition on the following party, by
regular, First-Class Mail:
<A>
    Commonwealth of Pennsylvania

    Realty Transfer Tax Division

    P.O. Box 280603

    Harrisburg, PA 17128-0603
</A>
<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 7.

<P20>The trial court issued a rule to show
cause why relief should not be granted and
taxes exonerated, and scheduled a telephone
hearing for December 21, 2020, at
2:00 p.m. R.R. at 10. The Cemetery filed a
second certificate of service indicating it
served the hearing scheduling notice in the
same manner it served the Petition. <EM>Id.</EM> at
8. The Commonwealth failed to appear at
the hearing. <EM>Id.</EM> at 34. The trial court
"inquired as to whether the Commonwealth
was served, [and] after being verbally
assured they were, [the trial court]
waited for a reasonable amount of time to
elapse and then granted [the] Cemetery's
Petition and marked the [o]rder as uncontested."
<EM>Id.</EM> at 34-35. The trial court entered
its order granting the Petition on
December 23, 2020. <EM>Id.</EM> at 12.

<P20>On January 21, 2021, the Commonwealth
filed a Motion for Reconsideration and a
Notice of Appeal in the trial court, raising
issues of jurisdiction and res judicata. <EM>See</EM>
R.R. at 13, 25. The trial court did not rule
on the Commonwealth's Motion for Reconsideration
because it believed it no longer
had jurisdiction. <EM>Id.</EM> at 35. Instead, the
trial court explained in its opinion in support
of order, which it filed pursuant to
Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure
1925(a), Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a), that it was not
aware the Cemetery may have improperly
served the Commonwealth. The trial court
also explained the Commonwealth's substantive
issues "were never properly
placed before [the trial court], nor did [the
trial court] have an opportunity to consider
them as the proper tribunal." <EM>Id.</EM> at 39.
Therefore, the trial court requested this
Court either affirm its order or remand
the case and permit the trial court to
address the Commonwealth's substantive
issues. <EM>Id.</EM> at 40.

<CN><EMB>II. Analysis</EMB>

<P20>On appeal, the Commonwealth raises
the following three issues for our review:
<Page 724>
(1) whether the trial court lacked jurisdiction
over the Commonwealth because the
Cemetery failed to properly serve the Attorney
General; (2) whether the trial court
lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider
the Petition; and (3) whether the
Cemetery's requested relief is barred by
principles of res judicata.<fnr3> <EM>See</EM> Commonwealth
Br. at 6-11.

<P20>The Cemetery argues it was not required
to serve the Attorney General because
the Petition "sounds as an appeal"
and is not original process. <EM>See</EM> Cemetery
Br. at 2. Specifically, the Cemetery argues
"it did not commence an action by way of a
writ of summons or complaint in either
civil action or in equity," and the "requested
relief [in the Petition is] for the Court
to overrule the initial determination of the
Department [] and find that the transfer
tax as allocated did not apply to the Cemetery."
<EM>Id.</EM> The Cemetery also argues the
trial court had subject matter jurisdiction
over the Petition because it involved constitutional
claims "such as the improper
imposition of taxes on a religious organization
in contravention of the federal and
Commonwealth Constitutions." <EM>Id.</EM> at 5.
Lastly, the Cemetery argues res judicata
does not apply because there has never
been a final judgment on the merits. <EM>Id.</EM> at
7.

<HN00>A. <EMB>Personal Jurisdiction</EMB>

<P20>We agree with the Commonwealth
that the trial court lacked personal
jurisdiction over the Commonwealth to enter
its order granting the Petition. The
Cemetery's affidavits of service show that
the Cemetery did not serve the Attorney
General. <EM>See</EM> R.R. at 7, 8. As this Court
has observed:

<B22>Such a failure is directly contrary to
both statute and court rule, e.g., 42 Pa.
C.S. &sect; 8523(b) and Pa.R.C.P. 422(a), both
of which direct a party serving process
on any Commonwealth party to serve it
as well on the Attorney General.

<B22>The relevant statute reads, "[s]ervice of
process in the case of an action against
the Commonwealth shall be made at the
principal or local office of the Commonwealth
agency that is being sued <EM>and at
the office of the Attorney General.</EM>" 42
Pa.C.S. &sect; 8523(b) (emphasis supplied).

<B22>The Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure
are equally clear: "Service of original
process upon ... a department,
board, [or] commission ... of the Commonwealth
... shall be made at the
office of the defendant <EM>and the office of
the attorney general</EM> ...." Pa. R.C.P.
422(a) (emphasis supplied).

<B22>Such a failure "cannot be overlooked"
and "cannot be excused," and the failure
by [the a]ppellee to serve the Attorney
General renders [the a]ppellee's service
on [the d]epartment "defective and deprived
the trial court of jurisdiction."
<EM>Reaves v. Knauer,</EM> 979 A.2d 404, 410 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 2009).

<P00><EM>Kreidie v. Dep't of Revenue,</EM> 156 A.3d 380,
383-84 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2017).

<P20>The Cemetery's attempt to frame the
Petition as an appeal rather than "original
process" to avoid Pennsylvania Rule of
Civil Procedure 422(a) ("Service of original
process upon the Commonwealth ... shall
be made at the office of the defendant and
the office of the attorney general") fails for
several reasons. First, the Church could
have filed an appeal of the Board's decision
directly with this Court, but the Church
did not do so. As a result, the Petition is
not an appeal of the Board's decision. Instead,
<Page 725>
the Petition initiated a new case
against the Commonwealth in the trial
court.

<P20>Second, the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court has explained that the purpose of
the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure
governing the service of original process is
to ensure that a defendant is provided
notice after a new action is commenced.
<EM>See McCreesh v. City of Phila.,</EM> 585 Pa.
211, 888 A.2d 664, 671 (2005) (citing Pa.
R.Civ.P. 400-430). Regardless of how the
Cemetery titled its Petition, it commenced
a new action against the Commonwealth.
As a result, the Cemetery was obligated to
serve the Petition in compliance with the
Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure
governing service of original process.

<P20>Because the Cemetery failed to serve
the Attorney General pursuant to 42 Pa.
C.S. &sect; 8523(b) and Pennsylvania Rule of
Civil Procedure 422(a), the Cemetery's
service was defective, and the trial court
lacked personal jurisdiction over the Commonwealth.
<EM>Kreidie,</EM> 156 A.3d at 384.

<HN00>B. <EMB>Subject Matter Jurisdiction</EMB>

<P20>We also agree with the Commonwealth
that the trial court lacked subject
matter jurisdiction. In its Petition, the
Cemetery asserted the Department
"lacked the authority to issue the tax assessment"
because "the transfer is exempt
from realty transfer taxes by statute."
R.R. at 6. The Cemetery requested that
the trial court "issue an order declaring
that the subject transfer is exempt from
realty transfer taxes, exonerate all back
taxes owed as against the Cemetery and
[void] the [assessment of transfer tax]." <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>The Department, in assessing tax on
this transfer, was acting pursuant to its
authority in Section 1111-C of the Code,<fnr4>
72 P.S. &sect; 8111-C ("the [D]epartment is
hereby authorized and empowered to make
an assessment of additional tax and interest
due ... based upon any information
within its possession or that shall come
into its possession"). Section 1111-C of the
Code provides that "[a]ny taxpayer against
whom an assessment is made may petition
the [D]epartment for a reassessment pursuant
to Article XXVII [of the Code]." 72
P.S. &sect; 8111-C(b). Under Article XXVII of
the Code, a taxpayer may petition the
Department's Board of Appeals for a reassessment.
<EM>See</EM> Sections 2701-2703 of the
Code, added by the Act of October 18,
2006, P.L. 1149, 72 P.S. &sect;&sect; 9701-9703. The
Department's Board of Appeals must then
review the assessment and issue a decision.
<EM>See id.</EM> The taxpayer may then appeal
the Department's Board of Appeals' decision
to the Board. <EM>See</EM> Sections 2704 of the
Code, added by the Act of October 18,
2006, P.L. 1149, 72 P.S. &sect; 9704. The Board
then reviews the matter and issues a final
adjudication, which is appealable, <EM>de novo,</EM>
to this Court. <EM>See</EM> Section 2704(i) of the
Code, 72 P.S. &sect; 9704(i).

<P20>These procedures are the exclusive
method for appealing the Department's assessment
of realty transfer taxes. <EM>See
Myers v. Dep't of Revenue,</EM> 55 Pa.Cmwlth.
509, 423 A.2d 1101, 1103 (1980) ("Since the
exclusive appeal procedure provided by the
[Code] vests jurisdiction in the Boards of
Appeals and Finance and Revenue with
the ultimate appeal to this Court, we conclude
that the initial phases of tax assessment
appeals are within the exclusive jurisdiction
of those Boards."); <EM>see also
Brown v. Dep't of Revenue,</EM> (Pa. Cmwlth.,
No. 839 C.D. 2015, filed Dec. 23, 2015)<fnr5>
(the Code's remedies for realty transfer
<Page 726>
taxes are "mandatory and exclusive"). As a
result, the trial court lacked subject matter
jurisdiction over the Cemetery's challenges
to the Department's assessment of
realty transfer tax.

<CN><EMB>III. Conclusion</EMB>

<P20>Because the trial court lacked both personal
jurisdiction over the Commonwealth
and subject matter jurisdiction, we vacate
the trial court's December 23, 2020 order
and remand this matter to the trial court
to quash the Cemetery's Petition.<fnr6>

<CN><EMBU>ORDER</EMBU>

<P20><EMB>AND NOW,</EMB> this 5th day of September
2024, the December 23, 2020 order of the
Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny
County (the trial court) is <EMB>VACATED,</EMB> and
this case is <EMB>REMANDED</EMB> to the trial court
to quash Bethel Cemetery's Petition to
Exonerate Taxes. Jurisdiction relinquished.

<fnt1> Act of March 4, 1971, P.L. 6, <EM>as amended,</EM>
added by the Act of July 2, 1986, P.L. 318, 72
P.S. &sect; 8102-C.3(17).

<fnt2> The Church conveyed the subject property
to the Cemetery to "clean up [its] records"
and give the Cemetery "ownership of the actual
areas of the cemetery to reflect the actual
historic use of property." <EM>See</EM> R.R. at 5. The
Church, not the Cemetery, appealed from the
Department's assessment. <EM>Id.</EM> Nevertheless,
the Cemetery averred in this matter that it,
not the Church, "proceeded to exhaust its
administrative remedies" after the Department's
assessment. <EM>Id.</EM> at 6.

<fnt3> Res judicata is defined as "an issue that has
been definitively settled by judicial decision."

<fnt5> Pursuant to Section 414(a) of this Court's

after January 15, 2008, for their persuasive
value, but not as binding precedent. 210
Pa. Code &sect; 69.414(a).

<fnt6> Due to our disposition of the Commonwealth's
first two issues on appeal, we need
not address whether principles of res judicata
may also bar the Cemetery's requested relief.

[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <dgn>JUDGE</dgn> <author>McCULLOUGH</author>.
[MT]
<P20>In this original jurisdiction action,
Jamar Patterson and Abron Ash (collectively,
Petitioners) challenge the constitutionality
of certain provisions of Section 13
of The Private Detective Act of 1953 (Private
Detective Act or Act).<fnr1> The challenged
provisions, <EM>inter alia,</EM> preclude private security
companies from employing as private
security officers individuals with specified
criminal convictions (Employment
Ban). Petitioners have been either denied
or terminated from employment as private
security officers because of their criminal
convictions. In their Petition for Review in
the Nature of an Action for Declaratory
and Injunctive Relief (Petition for Review),
they lodge both facial and as-applied challenges
to the Employment Ban, arguing
that it violates their right to engage in
gainful employment guaranteed by article
I, section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.<fnr2>

<P20>Now before the Court for disposition are
(1) the preliminary objections to the Petition
for Review filed by the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania (Commonwealth);
and (2) the amended preliminary objections
or, in the alternative, application for
summary relief filed by Larry Krasner, in
his Official Capacity as the District Attorney
of Philadelphia (DA Krasner) (together
with the Commonwealth, Respondents).
In essence, both the Commonwealth and
DA Krasner contend that they are not
proper Respondents and seek their dismissal
from this case.

<P20>After our careful review, we (1) sustain
the Commonwealth's preliminary objections
and dismiss it from the case; and (2)
transfer this action for lack of jurisdiction
to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia
County for further proceedings, including,
as appropriate, the disposition of
DA Krasner's preliminary objections
and/or application for summary relief.

<CN><EMB>I.</EMB> <EMBU>FACTS PLED IN THE PETITION
FOR REVIEW</EMBU>

<CN><EMB>A. Patterson</EMB>

<P20>In or around March 2022, Patterson, a
Philadelphia resident, applied for a position
as a security professional with Allied
Universal Security Services (Allied). The
position involved securing the exterior of
approximately eight buildings in Philadelphia.
Patterson interviewed with Allied for
the position on April 8, 2022, and was
extended an offer of employment contingent
upon a successful drug test and criminal
background check. Patterson then informed
Allied that he had a 2005 felony
drug conviction on his record, and Allied
rescinded the employment offer. Patterson
alleges that Allied rescinded his employment
offer pursuant to Section 13(a) of the
Private Detective Act, which prohibits security
companies from knowingly employing
an individual with a felony criminal
conviction.

<CN><EMB>B. Ash</EMB>

<P20>Beginning in 2017, Ash, also a resident
of Philadelphia, was employed as a security
<Page 730>
guard at the Philadelphia International
Airport for McGinn Security. Allied thereafter
acquired McGinn, and Ash continued
to work as a security guard. Ash then
relocated to Florida, where he continued to
work as a security guard first for Allied,
and then for Guardian Security. In April
2023, Ash returned to Philadelphia and
again obtained employment as an unarmed
security guard for Allied. On May 9, 2023,
Allied terminated Ash's employment as a
security guard due to his 2006 felony convictions
of simple assault, reckless endangerment,
and possession of an instrument
of crime.

<P20>In their Petition for Review, Petitioners
seek a declaration that Subsections 13(a)
and (b)(4) of the Private Detective Act
violate article I, section 1 of the Pennsylvania
Constitution by denying their right
to seek gainful employment. For relief, Petitioners
request (1) a declaration that
Subsections 13(a) and (b)(4) are unconstitutional
on their face and as applied to Petitioners,
and (2) an injunction precluding
Respondents from enforcing Subsections
13(a) and (b)(4) against Petitioners or any
other similarly situated individuals, including
by way of prosecution of security companies
that employ such individuals.

<P20>On August 25, 2023, the Commonwealth
filed preliminary objections to the Petition
for Review, arguing that (1) it is not an
indispensable party and, therefore, was
misjoined as a Respondent (Pennsylvania
Rule of Civil Procedure (Pa.R.Civ.P.)
1028(a)(5)); and (2) Petitioners' claim fails
as a matter of law because the Commonwealth
and its agencies do not have the
power to enforce, implement, or administer
the Private Detective Act and, accordingly,
no relief can be obtained against it (Pa.
R.Civ.P. 1028(a)(4)).

<P20>On August 16, 2023, DA Krasner filed a
preliminary objection to the Petition for
Review and, in the alternative, an application
for summary relief, in both of which
he challenged, under Pa.R.Civ.P.
1028(a)(5), the propriety of his joinder.<fnr3>
DA Krasner argues that the Private Detective
Act confers jurisdiction to investigate
and prosecute criminal violations of
the Employment Ban exclusively on the
district attorney in the county where the
offending entity maintains its license. Because
it is undisputed that all of Allied's
licenses are maintained in Montgomery
County, DA Krasner argues that he would
have no authority to investigate or prosecute
any violations of the Employment Ban
committed by Allied. Accordingly, he contends
that he is not an appropriate Respondent
and seeks his dismissal from this
action.<fnr4>

<CN><EMB>II.</EMB> <EMBU>DISCUSSION</EMBU>

<CN><EMB>A.</EMB> <EMBU>Preliminary Objections Standard</EMBU>

<P20>In ruling on preliminary objections,
we must accept as true all well-pleaded
factual allegations and any inferences
that reasonably may be drawn from
them. <EM>Neely v. Department of Corrections,</EM>
838 A.2d 16, 19 n.4 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2003). We
are not, however, bound to accept as true
"legal conclusions, unwarranted inferences
from facts, argumentative allegations, or
expressions of opinion[.]" <EM>Williams v. Wetzel,</EM>
178 A.3d 920, 923 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018).

<CN><EMB>B.</EMB> <EMBU>The Private Detective Act</EMBU>

<P20>Enacted in 1953, the Private Detective
Act regulates the business of providing
<Page 731>
private detective, investigative, watch,
guard, and patrol services. <EM>See</EM> Section
2(a)-(e) of the Private Detective Act, 22
P.S. &sect; 12(a)-(e). Businesses providing such
services must be licensed in accordance
with the Act, and applications for licenses
are submitted to the court of common
pleas in the county where the business
maintains its principal office. Sections 3(a)
and 4(a) of the Act, 22 P.S. &sect;&sect; 13(a), 14(a).<fnr5>
Licenses may not be issued to a person
previously convicted of a felony or certain
other enumerated offenses. Section 6(b) of
the Act, 22 P.S. &sect; 16(b); <EM>see also In re
Petition of McMillan,</EM> 319 Pa.Super. 59,
465 A.2d 1052, 1053 (1983) (the qualifications
required by the Act "were designed
to make sure that only people of good
character, integrity, and competency could
obtain a [private detective] license") (quotation
and citation omitted). Licenses must
be posted conspicuously in the agency or
office for which it is issued and are subject
to reasonable inspection by the "district
attorney or an authorized representative
or representatives of the Pennsylvania
State Police and the Attorney General."
Section 8 of the Act, 22 P.S. &sect; 18.<fnr6>

<P20>The Act prohibits security agencies from
employing individuals with certain criminal
backgrounds and criminalizes violations of
this prohibition. Specifically, Section 13(a)
of the Act prohibits the employment of any
individual who has been convicted of a
felony or certain other enumerated offenses,
including illegal possession of a
firearm or weapon, receiving stolen property,
reckless endangerment, and others.
Section 13(a) of the Act, 22 P.S. &sect; 23(a). A
first violation of this prohibition is a misdemeanor
carrying maximum penalties of a
$5,000.00 fine, one year imprisonment, or
both.<fnr7> <EM>Id.</EM> Relatedly, Section 13(b)(4) of the
Act requires, as a condition for employment
by a security agency, applicants to
execute and submit a verified statement
affirming, <EM>inter alia,</EM> that he or she "has
not been convicted of a felony[] or of any
offense involving moral turpitude[] or of
any of the misdemeanors or offenses described
in subsection (a) of this section."
Section 13(b)(4) of the Act, 22 P.S.
&sect; 23(b)(4).

<P20>As to enforcement, Section 5(a) of the
Act provides as follows:

<B22>(a) The district attorneys of the various
counties shall have the power to enforce
the provisions of this [A]ct, and, upon
complaint of any person, or on his own
initiative, to investigate any violation
thereof, or to investigate the business,
business practices and business methods
of any person, partnership, association
or corporation applying for or holding a
license as a private detective or investigator
if, in the opinion of the district
attorney, such investigation is warranted.
Each such applicant or licensee shall
<Page 732>
be obliged, on request of the district
attorney, to supply such information as
may be required concerning his or its
business, business practices or business
methods, or proposed business practices
or methods.

<P00>22 P.S. &sect; 15(a). District attorneys also have
the ability to subpoena witnesses "[f]or the
purpose of enforcing the provisions of this
[A]ct and in making investigations relating
to any violation thereof, and ... for the
purpose of investigating the ... business
practices of any applicant or licensee ...."
Section 15(b) of the Act, 22 P.S. &sect; 25(b).
Finally, Section 17 of the Act, 22 P.S. &sect; 27,
provides that "[c]riminal action for violation
of this [A]ct shall be prosecuted by
the district attorney of the county in which
any violation of this [A]ct occurred."

<CN><EMB>C.</EMB> <EMBU>Commonwealth Preliminary
Objections</EMBU>

<P20>We address the Commonwealth's preliminary
objections first because they are
dispositive of the entire matter in this
Court. The Commonwealth lodges two preliminary
objections to the Petition for Review,
which we address together because
they are interrelated. The Commonwealth
first argues that it is not a proper party to
this action because it is not indispensable.
In other words, the Commonwealth contends
that it has been misjoined<fnr8> as a
respondent because the relief sought by
Petitioners (declaring portions of the Private
Detective Act unconstitutional) can be
afforded without its participation. The
Commonwealth relatedly demurs to the
Petition for Review, arguing that the principal
relief sought by Petitioners&mdash;the enjoining
of enforcement of the challenged
provisions against Petitioners and similarly
situated individuals&mdash;cannot be obtained
against it because the proper party in interest
would be the party charged with
enforcing the Act, here, a local district
attorney.

<P20>Our original jurisdiction is conferred by
Section 761(a)(1) of the Judicial Code,
which, relevant here, grants this Court
original jurisdiction over civil actions
"[a]gainst the Commonwealth government,
including any officer thereof, acting in his
official capacity." 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 761(a)(1).
"Commonwealth government" is defined
as:

<B22>The government of the Commonwealth,
including the courts and other officers or
agencies of the unified judicial systems,
the General Assembly, and its officers
and agencies, the Governor, and the departments,
boards, commissions, authorities
and officers and agencies of the
Commonwealth, <EMB>but the term does not
include any political subdivision, municipal
or other local authority, or
any agency of any such political subdivision
or local authority.</EMB>

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 102 (emphasis added).

<P20>To properly exercise original jurisdiction
under Section 761(a)(1), more is
required than merely naming the Commonwealth
or one of its officers in a lawsuit.
Instead, the Commonwealth or one of
its officers must be <EM>indispensable</EM> to the
action. <EM>Stedman,</EM> 221 A.3d at 756-57. A
party is indispensable when his or her
rights are so intertwined with the claims in
the litigation that relief cannot be granted
without affecting those rights; in other
words, justice cannot be accomplished
without the party's participation. <EM>Id.</EM> at
757-58. By contrast, where the Commonwealth
party's involvement in the suit is
minimal and no relief can be afforded
<Page 733>
against it, it is not indispensable, and its
joinder to the suit is improper. <EM>Id.</EM> at 758;
<EM>Pennsylvania School Boards Association,
Inc. v. Commonwealth Association of
School Administrators, Teamsters Local
502,</EM> 696 A.2d 859, 867 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1997).
The question of indispensability is decided
by examining the nature of the claims
asserted and the relief sought to determine
whether the party has a right or
interest related to the claims and essential
to their merits such that due process requires
the party's participation in the litigation.
<EM>Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy,
Inc. v. Department of Conservation and
Natural Resources,</EM> 201 A.3d 273, 279 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 2018).

<P20>Pertinent here, although a challenge
to the constitutionality of a statute
might, in some circumstances, indirectly
affect the Commonwealth government, the
mere fact that the statute may ultimately
be declared unconstitutional does not, in
itself, make the Commonwealth indispensable
to the action. <EM>Phantom Fireworks
Showrooms, LLC v. Wolf,</EM> 198 A.3d 1205,
1214 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2018). Further, where a
petitioner presents an as-applied constitutional
challenge, the proper respondent is
the party responsible for enforcing the
statute. <EM>Pennsylvania Environmental Defense
Foundation v. Commonwealth,</EM> 285
A.3d 702, 713 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2022). <EM>See also
Stedman v. Lancaster County Board of
Commissioners,</EM> 221 A.3d 747, 757 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 2019) (<EM>en banc</EM>) ("for the Attorney
General to be an indispensable party, the
statute at issue must give him powers or
duties with respect to the law's <EM>enforcement</EM>
or <EM>administration</EM>") (internal quotations
and citation omitted) (emphasis provided).

<P20>Petitioners have lodged facial and
as-applied challenges to Subsections 13(a)
and (b)(4) of the Private Detective Act,
seeking (1) declarations that both sections
are unconstitutional and invalid, and (2) an
injunction enjoining Respondents from enforcing
those provisions against Petitioners
and similarly situated individuals. (Petition
for Review, &para;&para; 44-45.) Subsections
15(a) and (b) of the Private Detective Act
grant to local district attorneys the powers
to both enforce the Act and investigate violations
of its provisions, including violations
of Subsection 13(a). 22 P.S. &sect; 15(a),
(b). Section 17 of the Act further provides
that violations of any of the Act's provisions
are to be prosecuted by the district
attorney of the county where the violation
occurred. 22 P.S. &sect; 27. The Commonwealth,
although generally represented by
local district attorneys in the criminal context,
does not have any direct interest in
this action and does not administer, enforce,
or prosecute violations of the Private
Detective Act. The relief requested
by Petitioners therefore cannot be afforded
against the Commonwealth, and it is
not an indispensable party. We accordingly
sustain the Commonwealth's preliminary
objections and dismiss it from the case.

<P20>Given the Commonwealth's
dismissal, we must address whether this
Court continues to have subject matter
jurisdiction over Petitioners' claims.<fnr9> As
we already have determined, the Commonwealth
has no direct interest in this litigation,
and the relief sought by Petitioners
cannot be afforded against it. It therefore
is neither an indispensable nor proper party
to this action. Although this Court may,
in certain circumstances, exercise ancillary
jurisdiction over claims against local agencies
and their officers, such claims must be
<Page 734>
"related to a claim or other matter <EM>otherwise
within</EM> [<EM>our</EM>] <EM>exclusive original jurisdiction.</EM>"

added). Without any remaining Commonwealth
parties, we do not have original
jurisdiction over any of Petitioners' claims.
<EM>See Stedman,</EM> 221 A.3d at 756 ("[F]or this
Court to have original jurisdiction over a
suit against the Commonwealth and another,
non-Commonwealth party, the Commonwealth

indispensable party to the action") (citation
omitted). Resultingly, we may not exercise
ancillary jurisdiction over Petitioners'
claims against DA Krasner and need not
address his preliminary objections to the
Petition for Review. <EM>Id.</EM> at 760.

<P20>In these circumstances, we will
not dismiss the action but, rather, transfer
it to the proper court pursuant to Section
5103(a) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa. C.S.
&sect; 5103(a). Section 5103(a) provides, in pertinent
part:

<B22><EMB>(a) General rule.</EMB>&mdash;If an appeal or other
matter is taken to or brought in a court
or magisterial district of this Commonwealth
which does not have jurisdiction
of the appeal or other matter, the court
or magisterial district judge shall not
quash such appeal or dismiss the matter,
but shall transfer the record thereof to
the proper tribunal of this Commonwealth,
where the appeal or other matter
shall be treated as if originally filed
in the transferee tribunal on the date
when the appeal or other matter was
first filed in a court or magisterial district
of this Commonwealth....

<P00>42 Pa. C.S. &sect; 5103(a). <EM>See also</EM> Pa.R.A.P.
751(a). Because Petitioners have sued DA
Krasner, we will transfer the matter to the
Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia
County, which shall treat the Petition for
Review as a complaint filed in its original
jurisdiction and, upon receipt of the record,
rule upon DA Krasner's preliminary
objections. Pa.R.A.P. 751(a). <EM>See also Stedman,</EM>

<CN><EMB>III.</EMB> <EMBU>CONCLUSION</EMBU>

<P20>Based on the foregoing, we sustain the
Commonwealth's preliminary objections
and dismiss it from this action. Because no
Commonwealth parties remain, we are
without ancillary jurisdiction to consider
DA Krasner's preliminary objections and
accordingly transfer this case to the Court
of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County
for further proceedings.

<CN><EMBUI>ORDER</EMBUI>

<P20>AND NOW, this 15th day of November,
2024, it is ORDERED that the preliminary
objections filed by The Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania are SUSTAINED, and the
Commonwealth is hereby dismissed from
this action. It further is ORDERED that
the Petition for Review of Petitioners Jamar
Patterson and Abron Ash is transferred
to the Court of Common Pleas of
Philadelphia County (Common Pleas) due
to this Court's lack of original jurisdiction.

<P20>The Commonwealth Court prothonotary
shall transmit the record of the above-captioned
proceedings to Common Pleas'
prothonotary, together with a copy of this
memorandum opinion and order. Subsequent
to transfer, the assigned Common
Pleas judge shall rule upon the preliminary
objections of Larry Krasner, in his
official capacity as the District Attorney of
Philadelphia.

<P20>OPINION BY <dgn>JUDGE</dgn> <author>FIZZANO
CANNON</author>.
[MT]
<P20>The widow of Elmer Riehl (Claimant's
widow) petitions for review from the December
1, 2023, order of the Workers'
Compensation Appeal Board (Board),
which denied as moot Claimant's petition
to convert his benefits from temporary
total disability (TTD) to specific loss after
a prior remand by the Board to the workers'
compensation judge (WCJ) for hearings,
evidence, and findings of fact. Upon
review, we vacate and remand to the
Board for further proceedings in accordance
with this opinion.

<CN><EMB>I. Factual & Procedural Background</EMB>

<P20>Claimant sustained a disabling work-related
injury in October 2011. Certified
Record (C.R.) at 24. Beiler Brothers, LLC
(Employer) accepted the injury via a Notice
of Compensation Payable and began
paying TTD to Claimant. <EM>Id.</EM> The injury
was ultimately described as incomplete tetraplegia
with depression and anxiety resulting
from the October 2011 incident. <EM>Id.</EM>
In June 2020, Claimant filed a petition to
convert his TTD to specific loss benefits,
which are available when a claimant permanently
loses the use of a body part. <EM>Id.</EM>
In November 2020, the WCJ dismissed the
petition without prejudice to be refiled in
the Board's original jurisdiction, which
Claimant did later that month. <EM>Id.</EM> at 69;
<EM>see</EM> Section 306(c)(23) of the Workers'
Compensation Act (Act),<fnr1> 77 P.S. &sect; 513(23)
(stating that "[u]nless the board shall otherwise
determine, the loss of both hands or
both arms or both feet or both legs or both
eyes shall constitute total disability"). In
August 2021, the Board referred the matter
to the WCJ to produce findings of fact;
the matter would then return to the
Board, which retained jurisdiction. <EM>Id.</EM> at
425.

<P20>The WCJ held hearings and accepted
evidence, including Claimant's previously
recorded deposition testimony, Claimant's
widow's hearing testimony, which included
that at the time of Claimant's death, he
had no income other than his TTD and
Social Security disability benefits, and depositions
from doctors for both sides. Unfortunately,
during that phase of the litigation,
Claimant passed away in November
2021 from sepsis resulting from bedsores
that developed from his work-related tetraplegia.
C.R. at 25. Claimant's widow
continued the litigation as his surviving
spouse and estate executrix. <EM>Id.</EM> Claimant's
doctor testified that Claimant's mental
health conditions were not physically correlated
to his injuries, but are a recognized
secondary result of living with a disability.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 240-41. Both doctors opined that
Claimant's death was due to his work-related
injuries. <EM>Id.</EM> at 29 & 31.

<P20>In proposed conclusions of law for the
Board, the WCJ stated in a July 26, 2022,
opinion that Claimant had met his burden
of proof for specific loss benefits based on
his permanent loss of use of both arms and
both legs, although the WCJ did not specifically
propose an amount of benefit
weeks due to Claimant. C.R. at 34. The
WCJ also stated that Claimant's mental
health conditions constituted a disability
separate and apart from his work-related
physical injuries, so he was entitled to
TTD followed by specific loss benefits,
against which Employer could not claim a
credit for past-paid TTD. <EM>Id.</EM> at 32 & 34.
The WCJ also opined that Claimant's
death was due to his work injuries. <EM>Id.</EM> at
35.

<P20>Because the Board's August 2021 referral
to the WCJ for factfinding predated
Claimant's death, the Board had not included
any instructions in that regard. <EM>See</EM>
<Page 738>
<EM>id.</EM> at 425. However, the WCJ accepted
legal arguments from both sides concerning
whether Section 306(g) of the Act precluded
Claimant's widow from receiving
his posthumous specific loss benefits because
his death was due to his work injuries.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 32-34; <EM>see</EM> 77 P.S. &sect; 541 (stating
that "[s]hould the employe die from some
other cause than the injury, payments of
compensation to which the deceased would
have been entitled to under [the specific
loss provision of the Act] shall be paid to"
surviving dependents).

<P20>In the proposed conclusions of law, the
WCJ stated that in accordance with the
plain language of Section 306(g), Claimant's
death from his work injuries barred
his widow's entitlement to his specific loss
benefits. C.R. at 35. Claimant's widow had
argued for an equitable solution because
301(c)(1) of the Act, 77 P.S. &sect; 411(1), precludes
fatal claim survivor benefits if a
claimant's death from work injuries occurs
more than 300 weeks after the injury, as
was the case here.<fnr2> <EM>Id.</EM> at 33. The WCJ
expressed sympathy for Claimant's widow,
who by operation of the Act would receive
nothing in this case but stated that he was
constrained to follow the law as written.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 34. Although the matter automatically
returned to the Board, Claimant's widow
filed a protective appeal on the legal
issue of her eligibility for some form of
survivor benefits in this matter. <EM>Id.</EM> at 38.

<P20>Adopting the WCJ's findings of fact, the
Board stated that if Claimant had not died
while his petition was being litigated, it
would "likely" have awarded conversion of
his TTD to 1,640 weeks of specific loss
benefits. C.R. at 70-71 & 77. The Board
explained that this was due to Claimant's
loss of use of both arms and legs (each
having a value of 410 weeks pursuant to
Section 306(c) of the Act, 77 P.S. &sect; 513)
and having shown that it was financially
advantageous for himself and his family.<fnr3>
<EM>Id.</EM> at 77 (citing <EM>Arnold v. Workers' Comp.
Appeal Bd. (Lacour Painting, Inc.),</EM> 110
A.3d 1063, 1069-70 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015)).

<P20>However, the Board concluded
that Claimant's petition became moot when
he passed away because his death was due
to his work injuries and Section 306(g) of
the Act bars specific loss benefits for a
surviving dependent in that circumstance.
C.R. at 78. The Board acknowledged that
Claimant's widow might be left without a
remedy because fatal claim benefits, which
are available to a surviving dependent
when the claimant's death is due to the
work injury, are not available if the death
occurs more than 300 weeks after the injury.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 80 (citing Section 301(c)(1) of the
Act). Like the WCJ, the Board expressed
sympathy but was constrained to follow
the plain language of the Act. <EM>Id.</EM> at 80-81.
Claimant's widow timely appealed to this
Court.<fnr4>
<Page 739>

<CN><EMB>II. Issues & Arguments</EMB>

<P20>Claimant's widow points out that the
intended interplay of Section 306(g), which
makes specific loss benefits heritable when
the claimant dies of a non-work-related
cause, and Section 307, which allows fatal
claim benefits for surviving dependents
when the claimant dies of their work injury,
is to avoid double recovery of benefits.
Claimant's Widow's Br. at 12. However,
Claimant's death occurred more than 300
weeks after the work injury and pursuant
to Section 301(c)(1), his widow, a surviving
dependent will receive nothing. <EM>Id.</EM> at 13.
Claimant's widow avers that this is a harsh
and unjust result that the General Assembly
could not have intended. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>Claimant's widow asserts that Section
410 of the Act, 77 P.S. &sect; 751, should apply
here to allow her to receive Claimant's
specific loss benefits regardless of the
cause of his death. Claimant's Widow's Br.
at 14-16. This is because Claimant's petition
to convert his benefits from TTD to
specific loss was in litigation at the time of
his death and was ultimately found meritorious
by the Board. <EM>Id.</EM> Last, Claimant's
widow asserts that in the alternative, this
Court should interpret Section 301(c)(1) to
mean that even though Claimant's death
was medically due to his work injury, it
was not legally due to his work injury
because it occurred after 300 weeks had
elapsed from the incident. <EM>Id.</EM> at 16-18
(citing <EM>Tooey v. AK Steel Corp.,</EM> 623 Pa. 60,
81 A.3d 851 (2013)). Accordingly, because
Claimant's death was not legally due to his
work injury, his widow should receive his
specific loss benefits. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>Employer responds that the Act's plain
language in Section 306(g) limits the heritability
of specific loss benefits to where the
claimant's death is not from work-related
causes and that this principle has been
upheld in multiple cases. Employer's Br. at
10-14. Employer asserts that Claimant's
widow's Section 410 arguments are waived
because they were not presented to the
Board. <EM>Id.</EM> at 14. Employer also argues
that Section 410 does not apply because it
is a general provision in conflict with Section
306(g), which specifically states that if
a claimant's death is due to the work injury,
specific loss benefits will not be heritable
to surviving dependents. <EM>Id.</EM> at 15-16.
Lastly, Employer avers that Section
301(c)(1) cannot be manipulated to mean
that a claimant's death that is undisputedly
due to his work injury is not "legally" due
to his work injury if it occurs more than
300 weeks after the incident. <EM>Id.</EM> at 17-19.

<CN><EMB>III. Discussion</EMB>

<CN><EMB>A. Waiver</EMB>

<P20>We first address Employer's argument
that Claimant failed to raise Section 410 as
a basis for relief before the Board in its
original jurisdiction and, accordingly,
waived the claim on appeal to this Court.
Claimant's widow's argument to the Board
was based on equitable considerations and
the position that because Claimant's death
occurred more than 300 weeks after the
work incident that caused his injuries, it
should be considered a non-work-related
death as a matter of law even though there
was no medical dispute that his death was
due to his work injuries. C.R. at 78-81. In
that construct, according to Claimant's
widow, deeming Claimant's death not
work-related would render his specific loss
benefits heritable to her. <EM>Id.</EM> at 78-80.

<P20>Claimant's widow did not pursue
Section 410 as a means of recovering
Claimant's specific loss benefits when this
matter was before the Board in its original
jurisdiction, although she did raise Section
410 in her petition for review to this Court.
Petition for Review at 4. In many instances,
this would be a clear basis to find
waiver, as Employer argues here. <EM>See Rox</EM>
<Page 740>
<EM>Coal Co. v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd.
(Snizaski),</EM> 570 Pa. 60, 807 A.2d 906, 913-14
(2002). However, our courts have held
that as a general rule, when statutory
provisions are mandatory, they cannot be
waived. <EM>St. Elmo Development, LLC v.
Zoning Hearing Bd. of the City of Allentown,</EM>
320 A.3d 783, 788 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2024)
(citing <EM>Dowhower v. Workers' Comp. Appeal
Bd. (Capco Contracting),</EM> 591 Pa. 476,
919 A.2d 913, 918 (2007)). In this regard,
"the use of `shall' in a statute is not always
indicative of a mandatory directive; in
some instances, it is to be interpreted as
merely directory." <EM>Id.</EM> (quoting <EM>In re Canvass
of Absentee & Mail-In Ballots of Nov.
3, 2020 Gen. Election,</EM> 663 Pa. 283, 241
A.3d 1058, 1071 (2020)). "The true test [to
determine] whether a statute is mandatory
or not depends on whether the thing directed
to be done is of the essence of the
thing required." <EM>Id.</EM> (brackets in original).
In greater depth, this Court has explained:

<B22>Whether a statute is mandatory or directory
must be determined by considering
legislative intent gleaned from review
of the entire statute and from
considering the nature and object of
the statute and the consequences of the
construction of it one way or the other.
If the thing directed to be done is the
essence of the thing required, the statute
is mandatory. If, however, the statute
merely directs that certain proceedings
be done in a certain manner or at
a certain time, it is directory.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> (citations omitted).

<P20>Section 410 states in relevant part: "In
case any claimant shall die before the final
adjudication of his claim, the amount of
compensation due such claimant to the
date of death <EM>shall</EM> be paid to the dependents
entitled to compensation, or, if there
be no dependents, then to the estate of the
decedent." 77 P.S. &sect; 751 (emphasis added).
This is not a purely procedural provision,
like one that requires a certain time period
or format for a particular filing. It is, as
the above quote states, a provision where
"the thing to be done is the essence of the
thing required": if a claimant dies while his
or her claim is pending, the amount of
compensation due to the claimant shall be
paid to surviving dependents or the estate.
A claim in this context is a request via
petition for compensation of some sort, and
if that compensation is deemed appropriate,
the claimant's surviving dependent or
estate need not also file an additional petition
requesting that it be paid to them.
The final adjudication of the claim, if resolved
in the claimant's favor, must be paid
by the employer to the appropriate recipient.
This was clearly the legislature's goal
in enacting this provision. Section 435 of
the Act, added by the Act of February 8,
1972, P.L. 25, 77 P.S. &sect; 991, even provides
for penalties if an employer does not pay
benefits or compensation due to the claimant
or their surviving dependents or estate.

<P20>Because the requirement that an
employer pay surviving dependents or an
estate the compensation due to a claimant
who dies while a claim is pending is automatic,
the operation of Section 410 is mandatory.
If its requirements are met, its
application in a given matter is not waivable.
As such, Claimant's failure to raise
Section 410 before the Board in this matter
does not mean that this Court may not
consider its application as a matter of law.
Moreover, there is no factual dispute here
and both sides had the opportunity to brief
and argue the applicability of Section 410
to this case. Accordingly, there was no
waiver.

<CN><EMB>B. Merits</EMB>

<P20>Under Section 306(a)(1) of the Act,
a claimant may receive TTD after a work-related
injury when the claimant is totally
<Page 741>
disabled and has no earning power. 77 P.S.
&sect; 511(1); <EM>Steets v. Celebration Fireworks,
Inc. (Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd.),</EM> 295
A.3d 312, 316 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2023), <EM>appeal
granted,</EM> ___ Pa. ___, 311 A.3d 1005 (2024).
Section 306(c)(1)-(25) of the Act enables
specific loss benefits to claimants who suffer
the permanent loss of use of a body
part. 77 P.S. &sect; 513(1)-(25). Specific loss
benefits are payable without regard to
whether the permanent injury has actually
caused a wage loss and are based on a
schedule enumerated in Section 306(c),
ranging from 16 weeks for the loss of a
non-great toe to 410 weeks for the loss of
either an arm or a leg. <EM>Steets,</EM> 295 A.3d at
316.

<P20>If a claimant sustains both disabling
injuries and specific loss injuries,
pursuant to Section 306(d) of the Act, 77
P.S. &sect; 513, he or she may be eligible for
benefits for both if the disabling injuries
are separate and apart from the specific
loss injuries. <EM>Steets,</EM> 295 A.3d at 317. The
claimant cannot receive both at the same
time, but may do so in succession, with the
TTD usually first and the specific loss
benefits following upon the "end" of TTD,
which may be awarded through the claimant's
death. <EM>Id.</EM> Claimants may also petition
to convert TTD to specific loss benefits,
in which case the claimant must show
that the conversion to specific loss benefits,
which unlike TTD have a set ending
point once the allotted weeks elapse, is
"more financially advantageous" for the
claimant than ongoing TTD. <EM>Arnold,</EM> 110
A.3d at 1069-70.

<P20>When a claimant dies while receiving
TTD, the Act provides two modes by
which benefits may be available to surviving
dependents, such as a widow or children;
the determining factor is the cause
of the claimant's death. If the claimant
dies from his or her work injuries, surviving
dependents may file a petition for fatal
claim benefits, which are distinct from
TTD and available to the surviving dependents
as an independent right pursuant to
Section 307(1)-(6) of the Act, 77 P.S.
&sect; 561(1)-(6). <EM>Steets,</EM> 295 A.3d at 317. Relevant
to this appeal, Section 301(c)(1) of the
Act states that for fatal claim benefits to
be available to a surviving dependent, the
claimant's death from the work injury
must occur within 300 weeks, or about 5
and 3/4 years, from the date of the injury.
77 P.S. &sect; 411(1). This limitation "was intended
to prevent speculation as to whether
a work-related injury was the cause of
death years after the injury had occurred."

576 A.2d 401, 406 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1990) (discussing
another case where a widow
sought death benefits on the basis that her
husband's fatal heart attack was causally
connected to a work-related heart attack
that occurred 23 years earlier). In the fatal
claim context, the employer is responsible
for reasonable funeral expenses up to
$7,000, whether or not there are surviving
dependents. 77 P.S. &sect; 561(7).

<P20>If, however, a claimant receiving TTD
dies of non-work-related causes, fatal claim
benefits are not available, but any specific
loss benefits the claimant would have been
entitled to will be paid to surviving dependents
pursuant to Section 306(g) of the
Act. 77 P.S. &sect; 541. In this context, if there
are no surviving dependents, the only benefit
an estate may receive is funeral expenses.
77 P.S. &sect; 541(7).

<P20>The availability of benefits to surviving
dependents based on whether the
claimant dies from his or her work-related
injury (fatal claim benefits) or not (specific
loss benefits) is generally binary and mutually
exclusive. However, the Act also
contains Section 410, which states in relevant
part: "In case any claimant shall die
before the final adjudication of his claim,
<Page 742>
the amount of compensation due such
claimant to the date of death shall be paid
to the dependents entitled to compensation,
or, if there be no dependents, then to
the estate of the decedent." 77 P.S. &sect; 751.
Notably, Section 410 does not condition a
surviving dependent or estate's eligibility
for benefits based on the cause of death in
circumstances where a claimant dies before
his or her claim is adjudicated.

<P20>In <EM>Endres v. Workmen's Compensation
Appeal Board (City of Philadelphia),</EM> 677
A.2d 901 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1996), the worker
was severely injured in June 1984. His
right lower leg was amputated in July
1984, and he died later that month from
his work injuries. <EM>Id.</EM> at 902. After his
death, his widow filed petitions for both
fatal claim benefits and the specific loss
benefits the worker would have been entitled
to for the loss of his right lower leg.
<EM>Id.</EM> The WCJ awarded fatal claim benefits
but denied specific loss benefits on the
basis that the worker's death was due to
his work injuries; the Board affirmed. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>This Court affirmed in <EM>Endres,</EM> first explaining
that Section 306(d) is not a basis
for a surviving dependent to claim both
fatal claim benefits under Section 307 and
posthumous specific loss benefits under
Section 306(g) because 306(d) does not deal
specifically with a claimant's death, but
simply provides that "the payment of specific
loss benefits is to commence at the
end of the temporary total disability,"
which may or may not be due to death. 677
A.2d at 903. This Court also addressed
Section 410 as follows:

<B22>Section 410 of the Act is a general provision
which states that benefits due to a
claimant who dies before final adjudication
of his or her claim are payable to
the claimant's estate or dependents.
<EM>This statutory provision does not provide
an independent or supporting basis
for a specific loss award</EM> as [the worker's
widow] maintains.

<B22>Section 306(g) relates directly to the receipt
of specific loss benefits and is,
therefore, a more particular provision.[<fnr5>]
Enacted by the 1972 amendments to the
Act, Section 306(g) specifically addresses
the receipt of specific loss benefits by an
injured employee's dependents if the injured
employee dies from causes unrelated
to the work injury. Further, this
Court held in <EM>Burns International Security
Services, Inc. v. Workmen's Compensation
Appeal Board (Crist),</EM> 79 Pa.
Cmwlth. 340, 469 A.2d 336 (1984), that
specific loss benefits are payable to survivors
pursuant to Section 306(g) of the
Act where the decedent's death is from a
cause other than the work injury. Accordingly,
Section 306(g) of the Act supports
the WCJ's determination that [the
worker's] death from causes related to
the work injury does not entitle [the
worker's widow] to simultaneously collect
fatal claim benefits and specific loss
payments.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 903 (emphasis added).

<P20>In <EM>Estate of Harris v. Workers' Compensation
Appeal Board (Sunoco, Inc.),</EM>
845 A.2d 239 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2004), the worker
sustained serious work-related injuries
in September 1999, which led to amputation
of her right leg in mid-November
1999. <EM>Id.</EM> at 240-41. She died in late November
1999 from her work injuries with
no surviving dependents, after which the
employer paid her estate TTD through the
<Page 743>
date of her death and funeral expenses. <EM>Id.</EM>
at 241. Her estate filed a petition in January
2002 seeking the specific loss benefits
that the worker would have received for
the loss of her leg; the WCJ denied the
petition and the Board affirmed. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>The estate argued that although the
worker died from her work injuries and
had no surviving dependents, it could receive
the specific loss benefits she would
have been eligible for based on Section
410, 845 A.2d at 243. This Court disagreed,
quoting the statement in <EM>Endres</EM> that Section
410 "<EM>does not provide an independent
or supporting basis for a specific loss
award</EM>[.]" <EM>Id.</EM> (emphasis in original). Section
410 did not apply in <EM>Estate of Harris</EM>
because there was no claim pending at the
time of the worker's death and no independent
legal entitlement to the outcome the
estate sought: the worker's death was due
to her work injuries, but fatal claim benefits
were not available because there were
no surviving dependents. <EM>Id.</EM> at 244-45.
Even if the worker had died of non-work-related
causes, there were still no surviving
dependents with statutory eligibility to
receive the worker's specific loss benefits.
<EM>Id.</EM> The most the estate could receive under
either scenario was the statutory funeral
expense amount, which the employer
had already paid. <EM>Id.</EM> Affirming, <EM>Estate of
Harris</EM> concluded:

<B22>The [e]state would have this Court create
a new category of claim, i.e., payment
of specific loss benefits to an estate,
not a dependent, where death is
caused by the work-related injury and
not by another cause. This claim has no
grounding in the language of the Act
and is at odds with case law precedent.
The General Assembly has spoken, and
we are so bound.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 245.

<P20>In <EM>Steets,</EM> the worker sustained serious
work injuries in June 2017. 295 A.3d at
315. The employer accepted liability and
began paying TTD but contested whether
the worker sustained specific loss injuries
separate and apart from her disabling injuries.
<EM>Id.</EM> In October 2019, the WCJ concluded
that the worker sustained disabling
injuries separate and apart from the permanent
losses of both arms and would be
eligible for specific loss benefits at the
conclusion of her TTD benefits. <EM>Id.</EM> The
Board affirmed in October 2020 and the
employer timely appealed to this Court in
early November 2020. <EM>Id.</EM> In May 2021,
this Court affirmed and the worker's eligibility
for specific loss benefits at the conclusion
of her TTD benefits became final
when the matter was not further appealed
to our Supreme Court. <EM>Id.</EM> at 316.

<P20>In the interim, in late November 2020,
the worker died from her work injuries.
295 A.3d at 315. This occurred shortly
after the employer's appeal of the merits
of the worker's specific loss claims had
been filed in this Court, meaning that the
WCJ's adjudication was not yet final. <EM>Id.</EM>
The worker had no surviving dependents,
so in March 2021, her estate filed petitions
for funeral expenses and payment of the
specific loss benefits the worker had been
awarded but not yet received. <EM>Id.</EM> at 316.
The WCJ awarded funeral expenses but
denied specific loss benefits to the estate;
the Board affirmed, and the estate appealed
to this Court. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>In <EM>Steets,</EM> we first quoted Section
306(g)(7), which states: "If there be no
dependents eligible to receive payments
under this section then the payments shall
be made to the estate of the deceased but
in an amount not exceeding reasonable
funeral expenses as provided in this act[.]"
295 A.3d at 320-21 (quoting 77 P.S.
&sect; 541(7)). Because the worker died from
her work-related injuries and left no surviving
dependents, we held that the employer's
only financial obligation to the
<Page 744>
estate under the Act was funeral expenses,
which it paid. <EM>Id.</EM> at 320.

<P20>The estate argued in <EM>Steets</EM> that as a
matter of equity and policy, this Court
should "clarify" our holding in <EM>Estate of
Harris</EM> to allow estates to receive specific
loss benefits that would have been awarded
to claimants who die due to their work
injuries. 295 A.3d at 321. This Court disagreed,
concluding that <EM>Estate of Harris</EM>
was correctly decided and on-point. <EM>Id.</EM> at
321-23. We pointed out that in both cases,
the workers died from their work injuries
and left no surviving dependents; accordingly,
the employers' only statutory obligation
to the estates was to pay funeral
expenses. <EM>Id.</EM> at 321-23. We explained that
allowing fatal claim benefits and heritable
specific loss benefits but limiting them to
surviving dependents comported with the
Act's plain language and did not offend its
humanitarian purposes. <EM>Id.</EM> at 322 (quoting
Yen T. Lucas, <EM>Est. of Harris v. Workers'
Comp. Appeal Bd. (Sunoco, Inc. &
Esis/Signa)</EM>: Survival of Specific Loss
Claims, 15 Widener L.J. 519, 528-30
(2006)). We agreed with the Lucas article
that this was likely a policy decision on the
part of the legislature to ensure protection
of "those most vulnerable to the harm
occasioned by work-related injuries," such
as dependent widows, widowers, and minor
children and that only the legislature could
change the Act to treat surviving dependents
and estates equally in this context.
<EM>Id.</EM> Accordingly, in <EM>Steets,</EM> because the
worker left no surviving dependents, the
plain language and operation of the Act
limited the estate's recovery to funeral
expenses; therefore, we affirmed the administrative
tribunals. <EM>Id.</EM> at 323.

<P20>In dissent in <EM>Steets,</EM> Judge Ceisler,
joined by President Judge Cohn Jubelirer,
asserted that Section 410 authorized payment
of the worker's specific loss benefits
to the estate. 295 A.3d at 323-25 (Ceisler,
J., dissenting). The dissent noted that Section
410 does not condition its application
on the cause of a claimant's death and that
this Court interpreted it liberally in <EM>White
v. Workers' Compensation Appeal Board
(Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Hospital),</EM>
666 A.2d 1128, 1130 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1995), to
allow heritability of the TTD benefits that
the worker would have received from her
petition to reinstate her benefits, which
was pending when she died from non-work-related
causes and granted shortly
thereafter. <EM>Id.</EM> at 323-34 (quoting this
Court's agreement with the claimant in
<EM>White</EM> that "Section 410's scheme of distribution
applies to all claims regardless of
the nature of the loss[,]" 666 A.2d at 1130).
The dissent in <EM>Steets</EM> distinguished <EM>Estate
of Harris</EM> on the basis that the claimant
there had not petitioned for or been
awarded specific loss benefits prior to her
death while the specific benefits claim in
<EM>Steets</EM> was still in active litigation when the
worker died. <EM>Id.</EM> at 325.

<P20>Relevant to this appeal, the dissent in
<EM>Steets</EM> did not distinguish between the
would-be recipients after a claimant's
death; neither does Section 410, which
states that compensation due to a claimant
to the date of death "shall be paid to the
dependents entitled to compensation, or, if
there be no dependents, then to the estate
of the decedent." 77 P.S. &sect; 751. However,
in <EM>Endres,</EM> this Court described Section
410 as a "general provision" and stated
that where it conflicted with Sections
306(g) and 307, the more specific provisions
pertaining to specific loss and fatal
claim benefits, the more specific provisions
would prevail. 677 A.2d at 903 & n.2; <EM>see
also Steets,</EM> 295 A.3d at 318 (quoting <EM>Endres</EM>);
<EM>Estate of Harris,</EM> 845 A.2d at 243
(same). As noted, Section 306(g) (heritable
specific loss benefits) and Section 307 (fatal
claim benefits) provide detailed schedules
of who is eligible to receive what
benefits after a claimant's death. In both,
<Page 745>
individual recipients must be surviving dependents,
such as a widow or widower,
children, or parents or siblings who can
establish dependence on the claimant prior
to death. <EM>See</EM> 77 P.S. &sect; 561(1)-(6); 77 P.S.
&sect; 541(1)-(6). However, both sections also
specifically state that if no eligible surviving
dependents exist, then payment will be
due to the decedent's estate, but only for
burial expenses up to $7,000. <EM>See</EM> 77 P.S.
&sect; 561(7); 77 P.S. &sect; 541(7). The majority in
<EM>Steets</EM> explained that to award the worker's
specific loss benefits to the estate
would directly conflict with those provisions
of the Act and <EM>Estate of Harris. See</EM>
295 A.3d at 319 n.10, 321 & n.12. For that
reason, the dissent's position did not prevail
in <EM>Steets.</EM>

<P20>We reaffirm the holdings of <EM>Endres</EM> and
its progeny that the specific provisions of
Sections 306(g) and 307 will usually prevail
over the more general Section 410. <EM>See
Steets,</EM> 295 A.3d at 319 (quoting Section
1933 of the Statutory Construction Act of
1972, 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1933). However, this case
is factually distinguishable from those
cases in notable ways that combine to
make Section 410 applicable here. In <EM>Endres,</EM>
the issue was whether the worker's
widow could receive both fatal claim benefits
in her own right and the worker's
specific loss benefits that were available
because he sustained separate and apart
disabling injuries. This Court held that to
award the worker's specific loss benefits to
the widow in accordance with Section 410
would conflict with the plain language of
Section 306(g), which expressly limited the
heritability of specific loss benefits to instances
where the claimant dies from non-work-related
causes. 677 A.2d at 902-03.
Section 306(g), as a specific provision, prevailed
over Section 410, so the widow could
not collect the worker's specific loss benefits,
which are limited to deaths from non-work-related
causes. <EM>Id.</EM> Also, because the
widow in <EM>Endres</EM> had already been awarded
fatal claim benefits in her own right,
the resolution in that case prevented double
recovery, a tenet of the Act that stands
alongside its humanitarian goals. <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>Here, double recovery is not at issue.
Because Claimant's death from his work
injuries occurred more than 300 weeks
after his initial injuries occurred, his widow
is presumably not eligible for fatal
claim benefits. <EM>See</EM> 77 P.S. &sect; 411(1). Also,
unlike in <EM>Endres,</EM> where there was no
pending litigation when the worker died,
Claimant petitioned to convert his TTD to
specific loss benefits during his lifetime
and died while that petition was still in
litigation before the WCJ on the Board's
remand. This case fits Section 410, which
applies when a claimant dies "before the
final adjudication of his claim." 77 P.S.
&sect; 751.

<P20>This case is also distinguishable from
<EM>Estate of Harris.</EM> There, unlike here, the
worker had not petitioned for specific loss
benefits prior to her death from her work
injuries, so no litigation was pending to
trigger Section 410. Moreover, the worker
in <EM>Estate of Harris</EM> left no surviving dependents,
and even if her specific loss benefits
were deemed heritable, her estate
could only receive funeral expenses pursuant
to the clear language of Section
306(g)(7). Here, Claimant's widow is an
eligible surviving dependent eligible to receive
payment of heritable benefits.

<P20>In <EM>Steets,</EM> the worker's eligibility for specific
loss benefits was in active litigation at
the time of her death from her work injuries,
so Section 410 was applicable. However,
as in <EM>Estate of Harris,</EM> there were no
surviving dependents in <EM>Steets,</EM> so even if
the worker's specific loss benefits were
deemed heritable, payment of those benefits
to the worker's estate would conflict
with Section 306(g)(7), which limits an estate's
recovery to funeral expenses. Here,
<Page 746>
again, Claimant's widow is a surviving dependent
eligible to receive heritable benefits.

<P20>Although Claimant's widow would otherwise
be eligible for fatal claim benefits
based on Claimant's death from his work
injuries, she is, as noted, presumably
barred from receiving them because
Claimant's death occurred more than 300
weeks after the incident that caused his
injuries. Accordingly, the straightforward
operation of Sections 306(g), 307, and
301(c)(1) would leave Claimant's widow, a
surviving dependent, with no remedy at
all. Our Supreme Court has stated that it
is "inconceivable that the legislature, in
enacting a statute specifically designed to
benefit employees, intended to leave a certain
class of employees who have suffered
the most serious of work-related injuries
without any redress under the Act or at
common law." <EM>Tooey,</EM> 81 A.3d at 864. We
also recall our holding in <EM>White</EM> that "Section
410's scheme of distribution applies to
all claims regardless of the nature of the
loss." 666 A.2d at 1130.

<P20>Section 410 states in relevant part: "In
case any claimant shall die before the final
adjudication of his claim, the amount of
compensation due such claimant to the
date of death shall be paid to the dependents
entitled to compensation, or, if there
be no dependents, then to the estate of the
decedent." 77 P.S. &sect; 751. As noted, Section
410 does not qualify a surviving dependent's
receipt of benefits on the cause of
the claimant's death. Instead, the provision
occupies a narrow area in the operation of
the Act where the crucial point is not the
claimant's death, but the filing of the claim
or petition while the claimant is still alive.
If Section 410's requirement of litigation
instituted prior to the claimant's death is
met, its application will not conflict with
either Section 306(g) or Section 307, both
of which are triggered at the time of death
and applied depending on the cause of
death. Accordingly, to analyze a Section
410 claim, our workers' compensation tribunals
and courts must put aside the
claimant's ultimate death and the cause
thereof and focus on the preceding time
period between the filing of the petition
and the claimant's death.

<P20>Given the foregoing, the test for a Section
410 claim tracks the provision's language
as follows. First, the claimant must
have a pending petition or claim that is not
yet finally adjudicated at the time of the
claimant's death. Next, the claim as posed
at the time of filing must be meritorious
and prevail. If both elements are met, the
amount of compensation the claimant
would have been due "to the date of death"
(and regardless of the cause of death)
"shall be paid to the dependents entitled to
compensation, or, if there be no dependents,
then to the estate of the decedent."

<P20>As discussed above, Claimant did not
present a Section 410 claim to the Board.
However, as we have concluded, Section
410 is mandatory and not waivable. Because
Claimant's widow raised Section 410
to this Court, both sides have had the
opportunity to brief and argue its application,
and there is no factual dispute. Accordingly,
we will analyze Section 410 with
regard to this matter, focusing primarily
on the period between Claimant's petition
to convert his benefits and his death.

<P20>Claimant first filed a petition with
the WCJ in June 2020 to convert his benefits
from TTD to specific loss benefits.
C.R. at 70. Given our pronouncement in
<EM>White</EM> that Section 410 "applies to all
claims regardless of the nature of the
loss," Claimant's petition to convert his
TTD to specific loss benefits clearly constituted
a "claim." The WCJ concluded that
the Board had original jurisdiction over
this matter based on Section 306(c)(23) of
the Act, so Claimant filed his petition with
<Page 747>
the Board in November 2020. <EM>Id.</EM> In August
2021, the Board remanded the matter
to the WCJ for factfinding. <EM>Id.</EM> at 71. Days
later, the WCJ held the first hearing on
Claimant's petition and proceeded to take
evidence through a final hearing in April
2022. <EM>See</EM> C.R. at 113-59. During that time
period, in November 2021, Claimant died
from his work injuries. At the time of
Claimant's death, the litigation on his
claim seeking to convert his benefits was
ongoing and had not yet been finally adjudicated.
Accordingly, the first element of
the test is met, and Section 410 applies
here.

<P20>When the WCJ issued his findings of
fact in July 2022, he concluded that Claimant
had established specific loss of all four
limbs and disabling mental and emotional
injuries separate and apart from his specific
losses, meaning that Employer could not
credit the TTD benefits it had already paid
Claimant against the specific loss benefits
he would be eligible to receive at the end
of his TTD benefits. C.R. at 73. The WCJ
also credited Claimant's widow's testimony
that the conversion would be in the best
financial interests of Claimant's family. <EM>Id.</EM>
The Board adopted the WCJ's findings of
fact and opined that if Claimant had not
died while the matter was pending before
the WCJ, it "<EM>likely</EM> would have found it
more financially advantageous for Claimant
and, by extension, his family, to convert"
from TTD to specific loss benefits.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 77 (emphasis added). In light of the
Board's focus on Claimant's ultimate death
from his work injuries, which led the
Board to deem Claimant's petition moot,
this was not a final adjudication on the
merits. However, given the applicability of
Section 410, the Board's order will be vacated,
and this matter will be remanded to
the Board, which acts in its original jurisdiction
in this context. The Board shall
issue a final determination and opinion on
the merits of Claimant's petition to convert
his TTD to specific loss benefits, which
both sides will have an opportunity to appeal
to this Court so a final adjudication
may be reached.

<P20>When the matter is finally adjudicated,
and if it is concluded that Claimant's
petition to convert his benefits would have
succeeded, that conclusion would relate
back to November 20, 2020, the date he
filed his petition with the Board while he
was still alive and after his first petition
was dismissed by the WCJ for lack of
jurisdiction. At that point, Claimant would
have established eligibility prior to his
death for specific loss benefits based on
the permanent loss of all four of his limbs,
which would be 410 weeks per limb (1640
total) and perhaps also for additional
"healing period" benefits of 25 weeks, both
pursuant to Section 306(c) of the Act. <EM>See</EM>
77 P.S. &sect; 513.<fnr6> In those circumstances, the
second element of the Section 410 test
would be met. Employer would then be
obligated to pay Claimant's widow the full
amount, representing "the amount of compensation
due" to Claimant "to the date of
death." As discussed above, the ultimate
cause of Claimant's death is not at issue in
this Section 410 inquiry.

<P20>We emphasize that Section 410
will apply only in very narrow circumstances
where a claimant has a claim for
<Page 748>
compensation pending at the time of death
that ultimately prevails. If Section 410's
elements are met, "the amount of compensation
due" relates back to the time of the
filing of the claim or petition and does not
take the ultimate cause of death into consideration.
Usually, Sections 306(g) and
307 are applied when a claimant dies in the
absence of pending claim litigation, which
commonly occurs. When Section 410 applies
because claim litigation is pending
when the claimant dies, Sections 306(g)
and Section 307 still apply and work with
Section 410 to ensure the heritability of
some form of benefits that the claimant
sought but had not yet received prior to
death. To that end, there must be an eligible
surviving dependent to receive the benefits
because to award them to an estate
would conflict with Sections 306(g)(7) and
307(7), as illustrated in <EM>Steets.</EM> 295 A.3d at
320 (stating that because the claimant "had
no dependents with rights to either her
total disability or specific loss benefits
when she died ... [the e]mployer's only
statutory obligation was to pay $7,000 in
funeral expenses"). Finally, this application
of Section 410 comports with the Act's
policy goals of ensuring that surviving dependents,
like Claimant's widow, are not
left without a fair remedy when the worker
they depend on dies, whether from
work injuries or otherwise. <EM>See Tooey,</EM> 81
A.3d at 864; <EM>Steets,</EM> 295 A.3d at 322 (quoting
the Lucas article).

<CN><EMB>IV. Conclusion</EMB>

<P20>In light of the foregoing determination
that Section 410 applies in this matter, the
Board's order denying Claimant's petition
to convert his benefits from TTD to specific
loss as moot because he died from his
work injuries is vacated. This matter is
remanded to the Board for a final determination
and opinion on the merits of Claimant's
petition, which either side may appeal
to this Court.

<P20>President Judge Cohn Jubelirer and
Judge Covey concur in the result only.

<CN><EMBU>ORDER</EMBU>

<P20>AND NOW, this 18th day of November,
2024, the December 1, 2023, order of the
Workers' Compensation Appeal Board
(Board) is VACATED. This matter is remanded
to the Board for a final determination
and opinion on the merits of Elmer
Riehl's November 20, 2020, petition to convert
his temporary total disability benefits
to specific loss benefits, which may thereafter
be timely appealed to this Court.

<P20>Jurisdiction relinquished.
<FN>
<fnt1> Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, <EM>as amended,</EM>
77 P.S. &sect; 513(23).

<fnt2> Claimant's injury occurred on October 6,
2011. Three hundred weeks from that date
elapsed on July 6, 2017. Claimant's November
7, 2021, work-related death clearly exceeded
the statutory limit for his widow to seek fatal
claim benefits.

<fnt3> The Board first acknowledged the protective
nature of Claimant's widow's appeal and denied

<EM>Tloczynski v. Workers' Comp. Appeal Bd. (John

25-week healing period, which is the longest
applicable period, so if Claimant is ultimately
found eligible for a healing period in this
matter, it would likely be for an additional 25
weeks of benefits in addition to the 1640
weeks of specific losses.

<P20>OPINION BY <dgn>JUDGE</dgn> <author>McCULLOUGH</author>.
[MT]
<P20>Triple Crown Corporation, Inc. (Triple
Crown) appeals from the judgment entered
on May 10, 2023, after non-jury trial
in the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland
County (trial court). The trial court
found in favor of Lower Allen Township
(Township) on Triple Crown's claims challenging
the reasonableness and constitutionality
of certain permit fees assessed by
the Township during Triple Crown's construction
of two apartment complexes from
2014 through 2016.

<P20>This matter now returns to this Court
after remand to the trial court for a determination
of whether Triple Crown was entitled
to file post-trial motions <EM>nunc pro
tunc.</EM> By memorandum and order entered
October 6, 2023, the trial court granted
<EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief, denied Triple
Crown's post-trial motions, and returned
the record to this Court for disposition of
Triple Crown's appeal. Upon review, we
conclude that the trial court abused its
discretion in granting <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief
and therefore reverse its October 6, 2023
order to the extent that it did so. Because
Triple Crown has accordingly waived review
of any issues in this Court, we affirm
the judgment.

<CN><EMB>I.</EMB> <EMBU>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL
HISTORY</EMBU>

<P20>The instant litigation relates to two Triple
Crown development projects in the
Township, Brooks Edge and Stone Gate
Village (Projects). Brooks Edge contains
150 apartment units, and Stone Gate Village
contains 90 apartment units. During
the period between 2014 and 2016, the
<Page 751>
Township issued a total of 16 construction
permits related to the Projects, for which
it collected from Triple Crown a total of
$340,933 in permit fees (Fees).

<P20>The Fees were assessed in accordance
with a fee schedule set by the Township on
a yearly basis that is based, in part, on the
Building Valuation Data Table (BVDT) issued
by the International Code Council
(ICC). The ICC updates the BVDT every
six months based on the most recent available
data, and the Township utilizes the
BVDT in effect at the time of the filing of
a permit application to calculate permit
fees. For new construction projects, the
permit fees are calculated pursuant to the
following formula: gross new construction
floor area (square feet) &times; average construction
cost per square foot (from the
BVDT) &times; 0.01. Permit fees are calculated
and assessed by the Township's Community
and Economic Development Department
(Department).

<P20>Believing that the Fees were unreasonable,
unconstitutional, or both, Triple
Crown requested a refund from the Department,
which was denied. Thereafter,
on August 1, 2017, Triple Crown filed a
complaint against the Township in the trial
court, in which it requested declarations
that the Fees were unreasonable, disproportionate
to the Township's actual cost to
issue and administer permits, and an unconstitutional
delegation of legislative authority.<fnr1>
Triple Crown also sought a refund
from the Township.

<P20>On March 11, 2019, Triple Crown filed a
motion for partial summary judgment, in
which it requested that the trial court declare
the Fees to be an unconstitutional
delegation of legislative authority as a matter
of law and direct the issuance of a
refund. The Township opposed the motion,
arguing that the Fees were not unconstitutional
and, even if they were, such a ruling
would have prospective application only.
On July 22, 2019, after argument, the trial
court denied the motion, concluding that
Triple Crown had not carried its burden to
establish a clear, plain, and palpable constitutional
violation. Triple Crown appealed
to this Court, which, on the Township's
motion, quashed because we concluded
that the trial court's order denying partial
summary judgment was not final. <EM>See Triple
Crown Corporation, Inc. v. Lower Allen
Township</EM> (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 1169 C.D.
2019, filed November 20, 2019).<fnr2>

<P20>Both parties thereafter filed motions for
summary judgment, which the trial court
denied. Prior to trial, Triple Crown filed a
motion in limine to preclude the Township's
expert, Richard Grove, from testifying
because, according to Triple Crown,
Grove's testimony was irrelevant, misleading,
and unduly prejudicial. The Township
in response filed a motion in limine seeking
<Page 752>
to exclude the testimony of Triple
Crown's expert, Scott Koman, on the
grounds that Koman's opinions were based
on unwarranted assumptions and inaccurate
information. The trial court denied
both motions.

<P20>The trial court conducted a non-jury trial
from March 7, 2022, through March 9,
2022, and the parties filed post-trial memoranda
of law on April 29, 2022. Approximately
one year later, on April 26, 2023,
the trial court issued its decision, finding
"in favor of [the Township] and against
[Triple Crown]" (Decision). (Decision,
4/26/23.) The trial court issued an accompanying
opinion with the Decision, which it
titled "IN RE: PA R.A.P. 1925 OPINION."
(Opinion, 4/26/2023, at 1.) The trial
court therein concluded that the Fees were
not unreasonable or disproportionate. <EM>Id.</EM>
at 6.

<P20>Triple Crown did not file post-trial motions
pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of
Civil Procedure (Pa.R.Civ.P.) 227.1, but,
rather, on May 10, 2023, praeciped for the
entry of judgment on the verdict, which
was entered the same day. Triple Crown
then appealed to this Court on May 17,
2023. The trial court filed a "STATEMENT
PURSUANT TO PA.R.A.P. 1925"
on May 25, 2023, in which it relied on its
prior opinions filed on July 22, 2019, and
April 26, 2023.

<P20>The Township filed a Motion to Quash
Appeal in this Court on June 29, 2023,
arguing that all of Triple Crown's issues
on appeal were waived due to its failure to
file post-trial motions in the trial court. In
response, Triple Crown filed an "Answer
to Motion to Quash Appeal and Motion for
Leave to File Post-Trial Motion Nunc Pro
Tunc." (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at
2270a.) Therein, Triple Crown admitted
that post-trial motions were mandatory
and it failed to timely file them. It nevertheless
surmised that the trial court may
have entered its Decision as a Pennsylvania
Rule of Appellate Procedure (Pa.
R.A.P.) 1925(a) opinion "thinking (incorrectly)
that the bar of post-trial motions in
Pa.R.C[iv].P. 227.1(g) applied[.]"<fnr3> <EM>Id.</EM> at
2272a. Triple Crown alleged that its receipt
of the trial court's mistitled Decision
over one year after the conclusion of trial
led it to believe that it was foreclosed from
filing post-trial motions and that all of the
prerequisites to filing an immediate appeal
were deemed to have occurred. <EM>Id.</EM> at
2272a-73a. Triple Crown therefore requested
that this Court remand the matter
to the trial court so it could file post-trial
motions <EM>nunc pro tunc.</EM>

<P20>By memorandum and order entered
July 25, 2023, we (1) held the Township's
motion to quash in abeyance; (2) remanded
the matter to the trial court for Triple
Crown to file a motion for leave to file
post-trial motions <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM>; (3) directed
the trial court on remand to determine
"whether there was a breakdown in
the court process and/or non-negligent circumstances
that would justify allowing
[Triple Crown] to file a post-trial motion
from the April 26, 2023 [Decision] <EM>nunc
pro tunc</EM>; (4) permitted evidentiary hearings
on remand, if necessary; (5) directed
the trial court to remit to this Court any
supplemental record and/or opinion with
its decision as to "whether [Triple Crown]
demonstrated the existence of extraordinary
circumstances warranting <EM>nunc pro</EM>
<Page 753>
<EM>tunc</EM> relief;" (6) stayed the briefing schedule;
and (7) retained jurisdiction. (Memorandum
and Order, 7/25/2023.)

<P20>On remand, Triple Crown filed a "Motion
for Post-Trial Relief (Judgment Notwithstanding
the Verdict [(JNOV)] or, in
the Alternative, for New Trial) Nunc Pro
Tunc." (R.R. at 2264a.) Therein Triple
Crown requested judgment notwithstanding
the verdict or, in the alternative, a new
trial, but did not request leave to file the
motion <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> or assert any
grounds to support such relief. <EM>Id.</EM> Instead,
Triple Crown attached to its motion its
answer and motion for <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief
filed in this Court.

<P20>The trial court heard on-the-record oral
argument,<fnr4> but received no evidence. The
trial court ultimately determined that
<EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief was warranted and,
accordingly, considered and denied Triple
Crown's post-trial motion in its entirety.
After the return of the supplemental record
to this Court, we dismissed the Township's
motion to quash as moot, but permitted
the parties to address the propriety
of <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief in their appellate
briefs or by appropriate motion. (Order,
1/10/24.)

<CN><EMB>II.</EMB> <EMBU>ISSUES ON APPEAL</EMBU>

<P20>Triple Crown argues on appeal
that the trial court erred and abused its
discretion in (1) finding the Fees to be
proportionate and reasonable; and (2) concluding
that the Township's method of
calculating the Fees is not a palpably unconstitutional
delegation of legislative authority.
The Township raises two additional
issues, namely, (3) whether the trial
court abused its discretion in granting
Triple Crown <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief; and
(4) whether Triple Crown has waived its
right to request JNOV or a new trial.

<CN><EMB>III.</EMB> <EMBU>DISCUSSION</EMBU><fnr5>

<CN><EMBI>Nunc Pro Tunc Relief</EMBI>

<P20>Because we find it to be dispositive, we
address first the Township's argument
that the trial court abused its discretion in
considering Triple Crown's post-trial motions
<EM>nunc pro tunc.</EM>

<CN>A. Applicable Law

<P20>Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure
227.1 "requires parties to file post-trial
motions in order to preserve issues
for appeal. If an issue has not been raised
in a post-trial motion, it is waived for
appeal purposes." <EM>L.B. Foster Co. v. Lane
Enterprises, Inc.,</EM> 551 Pa. 307, 710 A.2d 55,
55 (1998). "Only issues which a party specifically
raises in its post-trial motions are
preserved and will be considered on appeal."
<EM>Burrell Education Association v.
Burrell School District,</EM> 674 A.2d 348, 350
(Pa. Cmwlth. 1996). "The purpose [of] Rule
227.1 is to provide the trial court with an
opportunity to correct errors in its ruling
and avert the need for appellate review."
<EM>Chalkey v. Roush,</EM> 569 Pa. 462, 805 A.2d
491, 494 n.9 (2002). Any issue raised in a
<Page 754>
motion for post-trial relief therefore must
be briefed and argued to the trial court.
<EM>Browne v. Department of Transportation,</EM>
843 A.2d 429 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2004).

<P20>The post-trial motion requirements
set forth in Rule 227.1 are mandatory
in both law and equity matters. <EM>Chalkey,</EM>
805 A.2d at 497. Under Rule 227.1, a
party must file post-trial motions at the
conclusion of a trial in any type of action in
order to preserve claims that the party
wishes to raise on appeal. In other words,
a trial court's order at the conclusion of a
trial, whether the action is one at law or in
equity, cannot become final for purposes of
filing an appeal until the court decides any
timely post-trial motions or they are denied
by operation of law. <EM>Id.</EM> at 496; Pa.
R.Civ.P. 227.4(b). <EM>See also Coal Tubin' PA,
LLC v. Cambria County Transit Authority,</EM>
162 A.3d 549, 553 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2017);
<EM>P.S. Hysong v. Lewicki,</EM> 931 A.2d 63, 66
(Pa. Cmwlth. 2007); <EM>Liparota v. State
Workmen's Insurance Fund,</EM> 722 A.2d 253,
256 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1999).

<P20><EM>Nunc pro tunc</EM> relief may be
granted only (1) in circumstances in which
a party failed to make a timely filing as a
result of a fraud or a breakdown in the
court's operations, or (2) where a party, a
party's counsel, or an agent of the party
has failed to comply with a filing deadline
due to non-negligent circumstances. <EM>Criss
v. Wise,</EM> 566 Pa. 437, 781 A.2d 1156, 1159
(2001); <EM>Weiman by Trahey v. City of Philadelphia,</EM>
129 Pa.Cmwlth. 25, 564 A.2d 557,
559 (1989). Generally, <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief
may be afforded only where "extraordinary"
circumstances exist to warrant it,
and the burden of establishing the existence
of such circumstances is on the party
seeking <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief. <EM>Harris v.
Unemployment Compensation Board of
Review,</EM> 247 A.3d 1223, 1229 (Pa. Cmwlth.
2021); <EM>Weiman,</EM> 564 A.2d at 559.

<P20>Although we have been unable to find
any cases in this Court addressing the
specific situation where a party's counsel
alleges that a trial court's filing misled
counsel to believe that post-trial motions
were unnecessary or foreclosed, several
cases from our Superior Court are informative.
<EM>See Commonwealth v. Monsanto
Company,</EM> 269 A.3d 623, 679 n.20 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 2021) (although Superior Court
cases are not binding on this Court, they
are persuasive precedent where they address
analogous issues).

<P20>First, in <EM>Lane Enterprises, Inc. v. L.B.
Foster Company,</EM> 700 A.2d 465 (Pa. Super.
1997), <EM>rev'd,</EM> 551 Pa. 307, 710 A.2d 55
(1998), the Superior Court concluded that
an appellant had <EM>not</EM> waived its issues on
appeal despite its failure to file post-trial
motions in the trial court. In <EM>Lane,</EM> the
trial court, after a non-jury trial, issued an
opinion finding in favor of the appellee,
Lane. <EM>Id.</EM> at 469-70. Because the trial court
did not issue findings of fact and conclusions
of law, the appellant, L.B. Foster,
assumed that the trial court's order was
final and praeciped for entry of judgment.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 470. Thereafter, in L.B. Foster's
appeal, the Superior Court concluded that
L.B. Foster had not waived its issues despite
failing to file post-trial motions because
"the trial court led both parties to
believe that its order was final[,]" and to
quash the appeal "would result in a blind
application of the waiver doctrine." <EM>Id.</EM> Given
the trial court's "<EM>de facto</EM>" final order
and in the interests of judicial economy,
the Superior Court considered the merits
of L.B. Foster's issues. <EM>Id.</EM> The Supreme
Court reversed in a terse <EM>per curiam</EM> opinion,
implicitly rejecting the Superior
Court's rationale and noting simply that
failure to comply with Rule 227.1's requirements
results in waiver of all issues on
appeal. 710 A.2d at 55.

<P20>In <EM>Lenhart v. Cigna Companies,</EM> 824
A.2d 1193 (Pa. Super. 2003), the trial court,
<Page 755>
after a non-jury trial, entered a verdict in
favor of the appellee, Lenhart, and against
the appellant, Life Insurance Company of
North America (Life Insurance Company).
<EM>Id.</EM> at 1194. The trial court also issued a
memorandum with its verdict that purported
to enter "judgment" in favor of Lenhart
and against Life Insurance Company. <EM>Id.</EM>
Life Insurance Company did not file post-trial
motions, and Lenhart thereafter praeciped
for entry of judgment. Life Insurance
Company appealed, and on Lenhart's
motion, the Superior Court quashed. <EM>Id.</EM>
Life Insurance Company then filed in the
trial court a motion for leave to file a post-trial
motion <EM>nunc pro tunc,</EM> which the trial
court denied. <EM>Id.</EM> at 1194-95. Life Insurance
Company again appealed, arguing
that the trial court created confusion by
granting "judgment" with its verdict,
which led Life Insurance Company to believe
that it had to file an immediate direct
appeal. <EM>Id.</EM> at 1195. The Superior Court
disagreed. Citing the Supreme Court's decision
in <EM>Lane,</EM> it concluded that the trial
court had not abused its discretion in denying
<EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief:

<B22>Life Insurance Company was on notice,
at the time of the decision of the trial
court after the non-jury trial, that regardless
of what terms were used by the
trial court in its decision, it was required
to file post-trial motions in order to preserve
any issues for appellate review....

<B22>[T]here is no excuse for Life Insurance
Company's failure to file post-trial motions
as required by our procedural
rules. The grant of <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief
is not designed to provide relief to parties
whose counsel has not followed
proper procedure in preserving appellate
rights.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 1197-98.

<P20>More recently, in <EM>D.L. Forrey & Associates,
Inc. v. Fuel City Truck Stop, Inc.,</EM> 71
A.3d 915 (Pa. Super. 2013), the trial court,
after non-jury trial, entered an order
awarding "judgment" in favor of the appellee
and against the appellant. The trial
court advised the appellant's representatives
after trial that their attorney could
advise them of their legal rights, which
included filing post-trial motions and any
appeal within 30 days. <EM>Id.</EM> at 916. Instead
of filing post-trial motions, the appellant
filed a direct appeal, which the Superior
Court dismissed without prejudice to the
appellant to seek <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief in
the trial court. <EM>Id.</EM> at 917-18. The appellant
sought such relief in the trial court, arguing
that the trial court's order led appellant's
counsel to conclude that, instead of
filing post-trial motions, he was required
to file an immediate appeal to preserve the
appellant's issues. <EM>Id.</EM> at 918. The trial
court denied relief.

<P20>The Superior Court affirmed, relying
heavily on its prior decision in <EM>Lenhart.</EM>
The court rejected the appellant's argument
that the trial court's order "confused"
its counsel into believing that the
trial court's order required the filing of an
immediate appeal without post-trial motions.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 922. The court further noted
that the appellant waited four months to
request leave to file post-trial motions
<EM>nunc pro tunc,</EM> suggesting that the appellant
failed to exercise due diligence in any
event. <EM>Id.</EM>

<CN>B. <EMU>Analysis</EMU>

<P20>In awarding Triple Crown <EM>nunc
pro tunc</EM> relief, the trial court reasoned as
follows:

<B22>Unfortunately, we have not encountered
any appellate rulings dealing with a situation
quite like the one before us today.
After a delay of almost a year, and
following an inquiry by [Triple Crown],
<Page 756>
we issued an opinion titled "In re: Pa.
R.A.P. 1925 Opinion." At several points
during the litigation, in discussions with
counsel and in our written decisions, we
have made it clear that the issues involved
in this case are of public significance,
the import of which extend far
beyond the geographical boundaries of
our judicial district. In short, we have
expressed the view that, inevitably, this
case would be reviewed by the Commonwealth
Court. Triple Crown maintains
that these circumstances and, particularly,
the styling of our opinion as
one written pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925,
led [it] to file an appeal rather than
post[-]trial motions. We are compelled
to the conclusion that these highly unusual
circumstances are extraordinary
for the purpose of considering [Triple
Crown's] <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> request. We are
also hard[-]pressed to conclude that the
actions of counsel were negligent. Admittedly,
we reach these conclusions because
the styling of our opinion contributed
to counsel's confusion in a manner
which we, as a matter of conscience,
deem to be significant. That these circumstances
should now combine to deny
Triple Crown the right to have this matter
considered on appeal[] would, in our
view, be unjust. Accordingly, we will
consider the post-trial motions of [Triple
Crown] <EM>nunc pro tunc.</EM>

<P00>(Trial Court Op., 10/6/23, at 4-5). We are
constrained to disagree.

<P20>Triple Crown does not argue that it was
not required to file post-trial motions or
that it was <EM>prevented</EM> from timely doing so
by any actions of the trial court or the
Township. Rather, Triple Crown argues
that it <EM>elected</EM> to not file post-trial motions
because it interpreted the <EM>title</EM> of the trial
court's Decision to mean that the trial
court had dispensed with the requirements
of Rule 227.1 and foreclosed the filing of
post-trial motions. Accordingly, Triple
Crown contends that it sought entry of
judgment and filed an immediate appeal to
preserve its appellate rights. Triple Crown
devotes a total of three pages of its reply
brief and none of its principal brief to the
issue of <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief and does not
in that space discuss or mention any cases
directly supporting its position. Rather, it
argues that there are no cases that "that
touch on the very specific factual situation
in this case," namely, that (1) the trial
court's adjudication was issued approximately
one year after trial, (2) the trial
court's opinion was titled as a Rule 1925(a)
opinion, (3) the issues are of public significance,
and (4) the trial court expected
there to be an appeal. (Triple Crown Reply
Br., at 2.) Triple Crown further relies on
the liberality of Pa.R.Civ.P. 126(a) and argues
that consideration of the merits of its
appeal will benefit taxpayers as a whole
and further "good government." <EM>Id.</EM> at 2-3.

<P20>We find the Supreme Court's decision in
<EM>Lane</EM> and the Superior Court's decisions in
<EM>Lenhart</EM> and <EM>D.L. Forrey</EM> to be on point
and their reasoning persuasive. As in all
three of those cases, the facts in this case,
although perhaps atypical, are not "extraordinary"
and do not evidence fraud, a
breakdown in the judicial process, or other
non-negligent circumstances justifying
<EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief. First, although the
trial court's Decision was mistakenly titled
as a Rule 1925(a) opinion,<fnr6> the trial court
also issued an accompanying order finding
in favor of the Township and against Triple
Crown on Triple Crown's claims. The
Decision therefore clearly was intended to
be a final disposition that, pursuant to
<Page 757>
Rule 227.1, would prompt the filing of
post-trial motions and not a direct appeal.

<P20>Second, we are not aware of any applicable
law, and Triple Crown has not identified
any, that would permit a trial court, as
a time-saving measure, to <EM>sua sponte</EM> dispense
with the requirements of Rule 227.1,
foreclose the filing of post-trial motions,
and force a party to praecipe for judgment
and file an immediate appeal. <EM>See Lenhart,</EM>
824 A.2d at 1197 (regardless of the language
in the trial court's decision, post-trial
motions still required by law). Indeed,
Triple Crown clearly knew that the trial
court's Decision was not a final, immediately
appealable order because Triple
Crown shortly thereafter praeciped for
judgment <EM>so that</EM> it could appeal. Triple
Crown's claim to have been confused and
misled by the title of the trial court's Decision
therefore is unreasonable and legally
untenable, and the form and timing of the
trial court's Decision is not, as a matter of
law, an "extraordinary" breakdown of the
judicial process or a non-negligent circumstance
that entitles it to <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM>
relief. Triple Crown simply failed to follow
procedural rules and elected to file a direct
appeal without filing post-trial motions,
which results in waiver of its issues. <EM>Lenhart,</EM>

County v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board,</EM> 79 Pa.Cmwlth. 14, 469 A.2d
1145, 1149 (1983) ("[M]ere neglect or administrative
oversight of counsel" cannot
justify <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief); <EM>Downingtown

breakdown in the court's operations occurred
and party was not misled by any
negligent or improper conduct of the trial
court; party's counsel simply made an incorrect
legal assumption that post-trial

WL 6829058 (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 1048 C.D.

824 A.2d at 1197-98) (<EM>pro se</EM> party's
failure to understand rules governing preservation
of appellate rights were not "extraordinary
circumstances" justifying <EM>nunc
pro tunc</EM> relief because "the grant of <EM>nunc
pro tunc</EM> relief is not designed to provide
relief to parties who have not followed
proper procedure in preserving their appellate
rights") (bracketing and ellipses removed).

<P20>Moreover, the fact that this appeal
may involve issues with broader application
in the Commonwealth cannot, in
itself, justify an award of <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM>
relief. For <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief to be
proper, the procedural circumstances, and
not the substantive legal issues involved,
must be "extraordinary." <EM>See Bethke v.
City of Philadelphia,</EM> 282 A.3d 884, 890
(Pa. Cmwlth. 2022) ("[<EM>N</EM>]<EM>unc pro tunc</EM> relief
is, by definition, extraordinary and not
`typical,'" and "it is the <EM>procedural</EM> circumstances,
not the merits or perceived
importance of the case, that must be extraordinary
to warrant relief.") (emphasis
in original). Whatever the broader reach
that the issues involved in this case may
have, they must, and should, wait to be
decided in an appeal that is properly before
this Court.<fnr7>

<CN><EMB>IV.</EMB> <EMBU>CONCLUSION</EMBU>

<P20>We are constrained to conclude
that Triple Crown did not establish that
<Page 758>
the trial court's typographical error and
delay in filing its Decision constitute fraud,
breakdown in the judicial process, or other
non-negligent, "extraordinary" circumstances
justifying <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief.
The trial court abused its discretion in
concluding to the contrary. Because post-trial
motions were mandatory and not
filed, all of Triple Crown's issues on appeal
are waived. We accordingly affirm the
judgment entered May 10, 2023.

<CN><EMUI>ORDER</EMUI>

<P20>AND NOW, this 20th day of November,
2024, for the reasons set forth in the foregoing
Opinion, the October 6, 2023 order of
the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland
County (trial court) is REVERSED
to the extent that it permitted Triple
Crown Corporation, Inc. (Triple Crown) to
file post-trial motions <EM>nunc pro tunc.</EM> Triple
Crown accordingly having failed to
preserve any issues for review in this
Court, it further is ordered that the May
10, 2023 judgment entered in the trial
court is AFFIRMED.
[DJ]
<P20>DISSENTING OPINION BY
<dgn>PRESIDENT JUDGE</dgn> <author>COHN
JUBELIRER</author>.
[DT]
<P20>Upon review of this matter, I respectfully
disagree with the Majority's conclusion
that the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland
County (trial court) abused its discretion
in granting <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief to
Triple Crown Corporation, Inc. (Triple
Crown). A court may grant a party <EM>nunc
pro tunc</EM> relief in two extraordinary circumstances:
(1) where the party failed to
make a timely filing because of fraud or a
breakdown in the court's operation; and (2)
where the party, the party's counsel, or an
agent of the party's counsel failed to comply
with a filing deadline because of non-negligent
circumstances. <EM>Criss v. Wise,</EM> 566
Pa. 437, 781 A.2d 1156, 1159 (2001); <EM>Weiman
by Trahey v. City of Philadelphia,</EM>
129 Pa.Cmwlth. 25, 564 A.2d 557, 559
(1989). Generally, the trial court is the
better forum to entertain <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM>
relief because it can conduct a hearing
when factual determinations are involved.
<EM>Weiman,</EM> 564 A.2d at 559.

<P20>Here, the trial court heard on-the-record
oral argument on whether to grant
Triple Crown <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief. The
trial court, which is in the best position to
appreciate what occurred, believes its actions
in styling its opinion as an opinion
pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate
Procedure 1925(a), Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a),
contributed significantly to Triple Crown's
confusion regarding whether to file an appeal
or post-trial motions. (<EM>See</EM> Trial Court
Op., 10/6/23, at 4-5.) After review, I would
not find the trial court erred in its decision
to grant Triple Crown <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief;
instead, I appreciate the trial court's
honest and courageous evaluation. The trial
court stated that it reached

<B22>these conclusions because the styling of
our opinion contributed to counsel's confusion
in a manner which we, as a matter
of conscience, deem to be significant.
That these circumstances should now
combine to deny Triple Crown the right
to have this matter considered on appeal,
would, in our view, be unjust.

<P00>(<EM>Id.</EM> at 5.) Faced with the same circumstances,
I trust that I would have made
the same decision. Accordingly, I would
affirm the trial court's finding these unusual
circumstances extraordinary for the
purposes of <EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief, and Triple
Crown's actions in reliance on the trial
court's actions non-negligent. Therefore, I
respectfully dissent from the Majority's
reversal of the trial court's October 6, 2023
order granting Triple Crown <EM>nunc pro
tunc</EM> relief, and I believe this Court should
review the underlying merits of Triple
<Page 759>
Crown's appeal from the trial court's May
10, 2023 judgment.
<FN>
<fnt1> Triple Crown sought relief pursuant to both
the Declaratory Judgments Act, 42 Pa.C.S.
&sect;&sect; 7531-7541, and Sections 1 and 2 of the
Pennsylvania Local Tax Collection Law, Act
of May 21, 1943, P.L. 349, <EM>as amended,</EM> 72
P.S. &sect;&sect; 5566b, 5566c.

<fnt2> On August 5, 2019, Triple Crown filed a
motion requesting that the trial court amend
its July 22, 2019 order and certify it as appealable
pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 702(b). The
trial court denied the motion, and Triple
Crown filed a petition for review in this
Court. <EM>See</EM> Pa.R.A.P. 1311, comment (under
the previous version of Rule 1311, the refusal
to certify an order as final was reviewed by
the filing of a petition for review; Rule 1311
was amended in 2020 to provide that such
refusals now are reviewed by the filing of a
petition for permission to appeal). We denied
the petition for review, concluding that "the
refusal of the trial court to certify the interlocutory
order for immediate appeal [was] not so
egregious as to justify prerogative appellate
correction of the exercise of discretion[.]" <EM>See
Triple Crown Corporation v. Lower Allen
Township</EM> (Pa. Cmwlth., No. 1382 C.D. 2019,
filed October 31, 2019).

<fnt3> Pa.R.Civ.P. 227.1(g) provides that "[a] motion
for post-trial relief may not be filed in an
appeal from the final adjudication or determination
of a local agency or a Commonwealth
agency as to which jurisdiction is vested in
the court of common pleas." Although the
Township assessed the Fees and denied Triple
Crown a refund, the action in the trial court
was not an appeal from any final adjudication
of the Township or any other local agency.
Rather, Triple Crown filed a civil action seeking
declaratory and injunctive relief.

<fnt4> Triple Crown's counsel indicated at oral argument
that they thought the trial court designated
its Decision as a Rule 1925(a) opinion
to "make up for lost time." (Notes of Testimony
(N.T.), 9/20/23, at 4; R.R. at 2331a.)

<fnt5> Our review of a trial court's denial of post-trial
motions is limited to determining whether
the trial court abused its discretion or
erred as a matter of law. <EM>Hunter v. City of
Philadelphia,</EM> 80 A.3d 533, 536 n.7 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 2013). We review an order granting
<EM>nunc pro tunc</EM> relief for an abuse of discretion,
which occurs when a trial court overrides
or misapplies the law. <EM>Union Electric
Corporation v. Board of Property Assessment,
Appeals & Review of Allegheny County,</EM> 560
Pa. 481, 746 A.2d 581, 583 (2000); <EM>Rutkowski
v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of
Driver Licensing,</EM> 987 A.2d 841, 846 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 2009).

<fnt6> Contrary to Triple Crown's assumption, the
trial court indicated at oral argument that the
title of the Decision was the product of "oversight"
and a "typographical error." (N.T.,
9/20/23; R.R. at 2330a.)

<fnt7> We also note that Triple Crown did not seek
to file post-trial motions until prompted by
the Township's motion to quash in this Court,
which was filed more than two months after
the Trial Court filed its Decision and then lost
jurisdiction to consider Triple Crown's issues
in the first instance. <EM>See D.L. Forrey,</EM> 71 A.3d
at 922.

[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <dgn>JUDGE</dgn> <author>FIZZANO
CANNON</author>.
[MT]
<P20>Melissa Jo Norris (Licensee) appeals
from the December 1, 2023 order of the
Court of Common Pleas of Clearfield
County (Trial Court) that dismissed Licensee's
statutory appeal from a 12-month
driver's license suspension imposed by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department
of Transportation, Bureau of Driver
<Page 761>
Licensing (DOT), pursuant to what is commonly
known as the Vehicle Code's Implied
Consent Law, 75 Pa. C.S. &sect; 1547(b)
(Implied Consent Law), as a result of Licensee's
refusal to submit to chemical testing
upon her arrest for driving under the
influence of alcohol or a controlled substance
(DUI).<fnr1> Upon review, we affirm.

<P20>The basic facts underlying this matter
are relatively straightforward. On May 5,
2023, the Pennsylvania State Police conducted
a wellness check of a woman reportedly
passed out in a vehicle in the
parking lot of the Dollar General in Irvona,
Clearfield County, Pennsylvania. <EM>See</EM>
Trial Court Opinion and Order dated December
1, 2023 (Trial Court Order) at 1.
Upon approaching the vehicle, the police
observed Licensee asleep in the driver's
seat with the vehicle's engine running and
the key fob in Licensee's lap. <EM>See</EM> Trial
Court Order at 1. Upon awakening Licensee,
the police observed that Licensee appeared
dazed, with bloodshot and glassy
eyes, and displayed mumbled speech that
was difficult to understand. <EM>See id.</EM> The
police believed at that time that Licensee
was under the influence of a controlled
substance. <EM>See id.</EM>

<P20>After Licensee failed two of three field
sobriety tests<fnr2> and admitted that she had
used narcotics the night before, the police
placed Licensee under arrest for suspicion
of DUI and transported her to the hospital
for a blood draw. <EM>See</EM> Trial Court Order at
1-2. At the hospital, the police read Licensee
DOT's form DL-26B (DL-26B Form)
blood testing refusal warnings in their entirety<fnr3>
and Licensee consented to have her
blood drawn. <EM>See</EM> Trial Court Order at 2;
<EM>see also</EM> DL-26B Form, Reproduced Record
(R.R.) at 1a.<fnr4> After multiple unsuccessful
attempts by the phlebotomist to obtain
a blood sample, Licensee verbally withdrew
her consent to the blood testing. <EM>See</EM>
Trial Court Order at 2. After Licensee
withdrew her consent, the police noted the
refusal on the DL-26B Form, which Licensee
signed acknowledging that she had
received the warnings thereon and had
refused to consent to further testing. <EM>See</EM>
Trial Court Order at 2; <EM>see also</EM> DL-26B
Form, R.R. at 1a.
<Page 762>

<P20>The police then transported Licensee to
the State Police barracks, where they secured
a search warrant for Licensee's
blood. <EM>See</EM> Trial Court Order at 2. The
police and Licensee then returned to the
hospital with the warrant to further attempt
to obtain a blood sample. <EM>See id.</EM>
Licensee was again cooperative and not
combative, however, once more the phlebotomist
was unable to secure a blood sample
from Licensee. <EM>See id.</EM> After this single
further unsuccessful attempt to obtain a
blood sample, Licensee stated that she did
not want to participate in any further attempts
to extract a sample of her blood.
<EM>See id.</EM>

<P20>Thereafter, DOT informed Licensee
that her operating privilege would be
suspended and she appealed (Suspension
Appeal). The Trial Court conducted a
hearing on September 8, 2023, and denied
the Suspension Appeal by Opinion and Order
dated December 1, 2023. <EM>See</EM> Trial
Court Order at 2, 6 & Order; <EM>see also</EM>
Notes of Testimony, September 8, 2023
(N.T.). Licensee timely appealed to this
Court.<fnr5>

<P20>Licensee raises one claim on appeal before
this Court: that the Trial Court erred
by determining that her conduct constituted
a refusal to consent to chemical testing
under the Implied Consent Law. <EM>See</EM> Licensee's
Br. at 9 & 15-20. Licensee argues
that where she cooperated with the attempted
blood draws and the phlebotomist
was unable to obtain a blood sample, she
did not refuse to consent to requested
chemical testing for Implied Consent Law
purposes. <EM>See id.</EM> at 15-20. Licensee is not
entitled to relief.

<P20>The Implied Consent Law provides:

<B22><EMB>(a) General rule.</EMB>&mdash;Any person who
drives, operates or is in actual physical
control of the movement of a vehicle in
this Commonwealth shall be deemed to
have given consent to one or more chemical
tests of breath or blood for the
purpose of determining the alcoholic
content of blood or the presence of a
controlled substance if a police officer
has reasonable grounds to believe the
person to have been driving, operating
or in actual physical control of the movement
of a vehicle in violation of [S]ection
1543(b)(1.1) (relating to driving while operating
privilege is suspended or revoked),
3802 (relating to driving under
influence of alcohol or controlled substance)
or 3808(a)(2) (relating to illegally
operating a motor vehicle not equipped
with ignition interlock).

<B22><EMB>(b) Civil penalties for refusal.</EMB>&mdash;

<B44>(1) If any person placed under arrest
for a [DUI offense] is requested to
submit to chemical testing and refuses
to do so, the testing shall not be conducted
but upon notice by the police
officer, [DOT] shall suspend the operating
privilege of the person as follows:

<B66>(i) Except as set forth in subparagraph
(ii), for a period of 12 months.

<B66>(ii) For a period of 18 months if any
of the following apply:

<B66>(A) The person's operating privileges
have previously been suspended
under this subsection.

<B66>(B) The person has, prior to the
refusal under this paragraph, been
sentenced for:

<B66>(I) an offense under [S]ection 3802;
<Page 763>

<B66>(II) an offense under former [S]ection
3731;

<B66>(III) an offense equivalent to an
offense under subclause (I) or (II);
or

<B66>(IV) a combination of the offenses
set forth in this clause.

<B44>(2) It shall be the duty of the police
officer to inform the person that:

<B66>(i) the person's operating privilege
will be suspended upon refusal to
submit to chemical testing and the
person will be subject to a restoration
fee of up to $2,000; and

<B66>(ii) if the person refuses to submit
to chemical breath testing, upon
conviction or plea for violating
[S]ection 3802(a)(1), the person will
be subject to the penalties provided
in [S]ection 3804(c) (relating to penalties).

<B44>(3) Any person whose operating privilege
is suspended under the provisions
of this section shall have the same
right of appeal as provided for in
cases of suspension for other reasons.

<P00>75 Pa.C.S &sect; 1547. This Court has observed:

<B22>To sustain a license suspension under
[the Implied Consent Law], DOT has
the burden of establishing that (1) the
licensee was arrested for drunken driving
by a police officer having reasonable
grounds to believe that the licensee was
driving while under the influence, (2) the
licensee was requested to submit to a
chemical test, (3) the licensee refused to
do so[,] and (4) the licensee was warned
that refusal would result in a license
suspension. Once DOT meets this burden,
the burden shifts to the licensee to
establish that he or she either was not
capable of making a knowing and conscious
refusal or was physically unable
to take the test.

<P00><EM>Giannopoulos v. Dep't of Transp., Bureau
of Driver Licensing,</EM> 82 A.3d 1092, 1094
(Pa. Cmwlth. 2013) (quoting <EM>Wright v.
Dep't of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing,</EM>
788 A.2d 443, 445 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2001)).
Here, Licensee challenges only the Trial
Court's determination that she refused to
consent to requested chemical testing.

<P20>"The question of whether a licensee
refuses to submit to a chemical test is
a legal one, based on the facts found by
the trial court." <EM>Nardone v. Dep't of
Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing,</EM> 634
Pa. 585, 130 A.3d 738, 748 (2015); <EM>see also
Park v. Dep't of Transp., Bureau of Driver
Licensing,</EM> 178 A.3d 274, 281 (Pa. Cmwlth.
2018). The question of refusal by a licensee
to consent to chemical testing "turn[s] on a
consideration of whether the [licensee's]
overall conduct demonstrates an unwillingness
to assent to an officer's request for
chemical testing." <EM>Nardone,</EM> 130 A.3d at
749. Pennsylvania courts have long and
consistently held that anything less than
an unqualified, unequivocal assent to submit
to chemical testing constitutes a refusal
to consent thereto. <EM>See Dep't of Transp.,
Bureau of Driver Licensing v. Renwick,</EM>
543 Pa. 122, 669 A.2d 934, 939 (1996); <EM>see
also McKenna v. Dep't of Transp., Bureau
of Driver Licensing,</EM> 72 A.3d 294 (Pa.
Cmwlth. 2013) (licensee's questioning police
regarding consequences of refusal and
refusing to sign consent constituted refusal
to consent to chemical testing); <EM>Hudson v.
Dep't of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing,</EM>
830 A.2d 594 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2003) (repeated
interruption and aggressive behavior
while being read warnings constituted
a refusal to consent to chemical testing).
Additionally, explicit refusal is not required
to find a licensee refused to consent
to chemical testing; "a licensee's conduct
may constitute a refusal." <EM>Park,</EM> 178 A.3d
at 281; <EM>see also Walkden v. Dep't of
Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing,</EM> 103
A.3d 432, 440 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014) (a general
<Page 764>
unwillingness to submit to testing demonstrated
by a licensee's overall conduct
demonstrated a refusal to consent to
chemical testing). Additionally, we observe
that, as factfinder in license suspension
appeals, the trial court determines both
the credibility of witnesses and weight assigned
to the evidence presented. <EM>Park,</EM>
178 A.3d at 284. "It is well settled that the
trial court's credibility determinations in a
license suspension appeal will not be second-guessed
on appeal." <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>Further, this Court has previously determined
that the Implied Consent Law
permits multiple attempts at testing, and
withdrawal of consent after unsuccessful
attempted testing can constitute a refusal.
<EM>See Winebarger v. Dep't of Transp., Bureau
of Driver Licensing,</EM> 655 A.2d 1093,
1096 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1995). In <EM>Winebarger,</EM> a
licensee initially consented to a blood draw
but withdrew his consent after two unsuccessful
attempted blood draws. <EM>See id.</EM> at
1095-96. The trial court found the licensee's
withdrawal of consent constituted a
refusal. <EM>See id.</EM> at 1096. This Court affirmed,
noting that the Implied Consent
Law permits "one or more" attempts at
chemical testing, including multiple attempts
at the same type of test. <EM>See id.</EM>
This Court expressly declined to limit, as a
matter of law, the number of permissible
blood draw attempts before subsequent refusals
would be rendered meaningless for
compliance purposes. <EM>See id.</EM> at 1095.

<P20>Here, DOT presented the testimony
of Pennsylvania State Trooper Austin
Woolcock at the hearing on the Suspension
Appeal. <EM>See</EM> N.T. at 3-16. Trooper
Woolcock testified that Licensee initially
consented to the blood draw and was cooperative
throughout the process prior to refusing.
<EM>See</EM> N.T. at 7, 9, 11-12 & 15. Trooper
Woolcock explained that a phlebotomist
made multiple attempts<fnr6> to secure a blood
sample from Licensee, without success.
<EM>See</EM> N.T. at 7-8, 9-10, 11-12. After these
multiple unsuccessful attempts to obtain
her blood, Licensee verbally withdrew her
consent to the blood draw by explaining
"that she was done and she was not going
to get poked anymore." N.T. at 9-10.
Trooper Woolcock took this statement as a
refusal and transported Licensee to the
State Police barracks, where he obtained a
search warrant for Licensee's blood. <EM>See</EM>
N.T. at 10 & 12-13. After securing the
search warrant, Trooper Woolcock again
transported Licensee to the hospital,
where she was again cooperative with a
further attempt to take her blood, which
also proved unsuccessful.<fnr7> <EM>See</EM> N.T. at 10
& 13-15. The second time in the hospital,
Licensee verbally withdrew her consent to
the blood draw after only one failed attempt
to secure a sample. <EM>See</EM> N.T. at 13-15.

<P20>Based on this evidence, the Trial Court
concluded that Licensee refused by failing
to complete the requested chemical testing.
<EM>See</EM> Trial Court Order at 5. The Trial
Court observed that the above evidence of
refusal shifted the burden to Licensee to
prove by competent medical evidence that
she was physically unable to take the test
or make a knowing and conscious refusal.
<Page 765>
<EM>See id.</EM> at 6. The Trial Court then explained
that Licensee failed to meet her
burden because she neither testified nor
called any expert witness to attest to her
physical inability to take the test or that
she was not capable of making a knowing
or conscious refusal. <EM>See id.</EM> The Trial
Court then dismissed the Suspension Appeal,
observing that

<B22>[w]hile th[e Trial C]ourt recognizes that
[Licensee] put forth a good faith effort
to comply and complete the chemical
testing, she ultimately failed to do so.
[Licensee] had the opportunity to establish
that she was physically and/or medically
unable to take the test at the hearing,
but failed to produce any evidence
or witnesses to attest to such an inability.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 6.

<P20>We find no error with the Trial
Court's determination. The Implied Consent
Law requires not only that a licensee
submit to and take requested chemical
testing, but also that the licensee complete
such testing. <EM>See Murray v. Commonwealth,</EM>
143 Pa.Cmwlth. 358,598 A.2d 1356,
1358 (1991). Here, Licensee did not complete
the requested testing in this case.
While she did initially consent to the blood
draw, Licensee withdrew her consent after
unsuccessful attempts to complete the requested
testing and before a blood sample
could be successfully obtained by the authorities.<fnr8>
Simply put, the Implied Consent
Law permits multiple attempts at chemical
testing. <EM>See</EM> 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1547(a); <EM>Winebarger,</EM>
655 A.2d at 1096. Thus, under the
Implied Consent Law and the existing case
law of this Commonwealth, Licensee's
withdrawal of her consent to the blood
draw constitutes a refusal of chemical testing.
<EM>See id.</EM> Therefore, Trial Court did not
err in determining that DOT proved such a
refusal based on the testimony of Trooper
Woolcock.

<P20>DOT having established a refusal, the
burden then shifted to Licensee to establish
either that she was not capable of
making a knowing and conscious refusal or
that she was physically unable to take the
test. Licensee put forth no evidence that
she was incapable of making a knowing
and conscious refusal, and her express,
verbal withdraw of her consent surely evidences
her capability to do so. Likewise,
Licensee put forth no expert medical evidence
to support a claim that she was
physically incapable of submitting to the
testing, which again was evidenced by her
having done so prior to withdrawing her
consent. Thus, Licensee did not carry her
shifted burden to establish that she could
not knowingly refuse or physically take the
requested testing. <EM>See Winebarger,</EM> 655
A.2d at 1096 (finding that where licensee
failed to put forth medical evidence that he
was physically unable to give blood sample
and evidence of record indicated he was
capable, licensee failed to carry shifted
burden requiring he establish that he
could not have knowingly refused or was
physically incapable of complying with requested
chemical testing).

<P20>To the extent Licensee's withdrawal
of her consent was occasioned by
the phlebotomist's failure to successfully
complete the blood draw, the record contains
no explanation why the phlebotomist
was unable to successfully draw a blood
sample. We observe, however, that the Implied
Consent Law does not provide an
exception for the inability of a phlebotomist
to secure a blood draw, nor does the
<Page 766>
Implied Consent Law otherwise provide
for any number of unsuccessful attempts
to draw blood after which a licensee would
be excused from subjecting herself to further
attempts. <EM>See</EM> 75 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1547(b).
Thus, while we appreciate the argument
that a licensee should not be required to
submit herself to repeated unsuccessful
blood draw attempts occasioned either by
some medical condition or the incompetence
of a phlebotomist engaged to complete
the blood draws, the Implied Consent
Law simply does not provide such an exception
to the requirement that a licensee
submit to chemical testing when requested
following a DUI arrest. <EM>See id.</EM> Further,
even assuming the Implied Consent Law
contemplated or allowed such an exception,
the facts of the instant matter would not
warrant a different outcome. The record
here does not reveal that the phlebotomist
in any way acknowledged or recognized
the futility of the efforts to secure a blood
sample or otherwise gave up on the endeavor
to secure a sample. Instead, the
record reveals that Licensee purposely
withdrew her consent to continue with
testing to avoid the continued discomfort
required by such testing. Thus, it was Licensee's
volition that ended the testing,
not an expression by the medical professional
performing the testing that further
attempts to complete the testing would
prove futile.<fnr9>

<P20>Further, we observe that Licensee's
good faith in originally consenting to the
blood draws is irrelevant to the matter. In
cases involving breath testing conducted
via breathalyzer machine, this Court has
noted that failure to complete chemical
testing represents a refusal, regardless of
intent. <EM>See, e.g., Sweeney v. Dep't of
Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing,</EM> 804
A.2d 685, 687 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2002) (insufficient
breath sample provided into breathlyzer
machine). While we appreciate that a
blood draw differs from chemical testing
performed with a breathalyzer in that it
relies on the skill of the phlebotomist<fnr10>
and the availability of adequate veins/arteries
as opposed to the effort of the licensee,
the Implied Consent Law still requires
that a licensee must complete the
testing, which did not occur in this instance.

<P20>For these reasons, we affirm the Trial
Court Order.

<CN><EMBU>ORDER</EMBU>

<P20>AND NOW, this 26th day of November,
2024, the December 1, 2023 order of the
Court of Common Pleas of Clearfield
County is AFFIRMED.
<FN>
<fnt1> 75 Pa. C.S. &sect; 3802.

<fnt2> Licensee first satisfactorily performed the
Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test, followed by
the walk-and-turn test and the one-legged
stand, each of which indicated impairment.
<EM>See</EM> Trial Court Order at 1-2.

<fnt3> The DL-26B Form's blood testing warnings
read as follows:

<B22>It is my duty to as a police officer to inform
you of the following:

<B22>1. You are under arrest for driving under
the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance
in violation of Section 3802 of the
Vehicle Code.

<B22>2. I am requesting that you submit to a
chemical test of blood.

<B22>3. If you refuse to submit to the blood test,
your operating privilege will be suspended
for at least 12 months. If you previously
refused a chemical test or were previously
convicted of driving under the influence,
your operating privilege will be suspended
for up to 18 months. If your operating privilege
is suspended for refusing chemical testing,
you will have to pay a restoration fee of
up to $2,000 in order to have your operating
privilege restored.

<B22>4. You have no right to speak with an
attorney or anyone else before deciding
whether to submit to testing. If you request
to speak with an attorney or anyone else
after being provided these warnings or you
remain silent when asked to submit to a
blood test, you will have refused the test.

<P00>DL-26B Form, Reproduced Record (R.R.) at
1a.

<fnt4> Licensee did not number the Reproduced
Record as required by Pennsylvania Rule of
Appellate Procedure 2173. The Court, however,
has supplied the appropriate pagination
for the Reproduced Record beginning with
the DL-26B Form as page "1a" in accordance
with Rule 2173.

<fnt5> "Our standard of review in a license suspension
case is to determine whether the factual
findings of the trial court are supported by
[substantial] evidence and whether the trial
court committed an error of law or an abuse
of discretion." <EM>Negovan v. Dep't of Transp.,
Bureau of Driver Licensing,</EM> 172 A.3d 733, 735
n.4 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2017).

<fnt6> The record does not definitively indicate the
exact number of attempts made by the phlebotomist
to obtain a sample of Licensee's
blood during this first visit to the hospital.
Trooper Woolcock related that, prior to Licensee
withdrawing her consent, the phlebotomist
"did poke her a couple of times to get
a sample but was unsuccessful." N.T. at 9. On
cross-examination, Trooper Woolcock repeated
that the phlebotomist made multiple
attempts to obtain Licensee's blood, but not
more than five or six. <EM>See</EM> N.T. at 11.

<fnt7> Trooper Woolcock testified that he did not
observe any blood being drawn out of Licensee's
artery during this attempted blood draw.
<EM>See</EM> N.T. at 15.

<fnt8> We note that the refusal in this matter concerns
only Licensee's initial refusal during
her first trip to the hospital. When Licensee
returned to the hospital with the police for the
second time, the blood draw was conducted
under the authority of the search warrant
recently secured by the police and was not
subject to Licensee's consent.

<fnt9> While we appreciate the subtle difference
between a fear of needles and an unwillingness
to subject oneself to repeated attempts at
a blood draw requiring a needle stick, because
Licensee withdrew her consent, this
case is akin to cases in which this Court has
found that a licensee's aversion to or fear of
needles, even supported by medical evidence,
is an insufficient reason to excuse licensee
non-cooperation with requested chemical
testing. <EM>See Lombardo v. Dep't of Transp., Bureau
of Driver Licensing</EM> (Pa. Cmwlth., No.
1959 C.D. 2014, filed June 8, 2015), slip op. at
6, 2015 WL 5449148 (citing <EM>Jacobs v. Dep't of
Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing,</EM> 695 A.2d
956, 958 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1997)).

<fnt10> In making this observation, we pass no
judgment on the competency of the phlebotomist
involved in the instant matter.

<P20><AN>Julia K. Scott-Benevides, Esq.</AN>, for Defendants.
[MT]
<CN><EMB>ORDER</EMB>

<P20>The plaintiff, Hongnian Guo, appeals
from a Superior Court order granting the
defendants'<fnr1> motion to dismiss "without
prejudice." Said motion had invoked both
Rule 8(a) and Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior
Court Rules of Civil Procedure, and the
hearing justice cited both rules in granting
the motion to dismiss. The order granting
the motion to dismiss was entered on December
11, 2023; and the plaintiff, who was
not represented by counsel in the Superior
Court and is also self-represented in this
Court, filed a notice of appeal on the same
day.

<P20>This case came before the Supreme
Court pursuant to an order directing the
parties to appear and show cause why the
issues raised in this appeal should not be
summarily decided. After considering the
parties' written and oral submissions and
after carefully reviewing the record, we
conclude that cause has not been shown
and that this case may be decided without
further briefing or argument. For the reasons
set forth herein, we affirm the December
11, 2023 order of the Superior
Court.

<P20>On August 3, 2023, plaintiff filed a handwritten
complaint against defendants in
the Superior Court. The complaint alleged
that the Barrington Police Department
had improperly served plaintiff with a restraining
order that had been issued by
the District Court in Brookline, Massachusetts.
The complaint further alleged that
defendants had improperly seized property
from plaintiff and withheld records from
him.

<P20>On August 28, 2023, defendants filed a
motion to dismiss. The defendants' motion
and the memorandum filed in support
thereof contended that the complaint
should be dismissed pursuant to Rules 8(a)
and 12(b)(6). The defendants argued that,
in disregard of the provisions of Rule 8(a),
plaintiff had failed to put defendants on
notice of the claims against them. Additionally,
defendants contended that plaintiff's
complaint was unclear, confusing, and
conclusory. The defendants, citing Rule
12(b)(6), also contended that plaintiff's
complaint failed to state a claim upon
which relief might be granted.

<P20>On August 31, 2023, plaintiff filed an
objection to defendants' motion to dismiss.
Several weeks later, on October 10, 2023,
plaintiff filed, among other documents, six
affidavits and a memorandum of law.<fnr2> In
the October 10 filings, which were filed
<Page 768>
well after the complaint had been filed,
plaintiff made reference to what he considered
to be evidence relating to an abuse
prevention order and the seizure of property
from his home, all purportedly relevant
to the allegations in his complaint.

<P20>On December 5, 2023, the hearing justice
granted defendants' motion to dismiss,
having determined that the complaint
failed to meet the requirements of Rules
8(a) and 12(b)(6). The hearing justice further
noted that, although he was required
to limit his review to the four corners of
the complaint, his decision would not have
been different if the October 10 filings and
the later "updates" had been adequately
"incorporated into the complaint * * *."

<P20>In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal,
this Court applies the same standards applied
by the hearing justice, limiting our
review to the four corners of the complaint.
<EM>Fuller Mill Realty, LLC v. Rhode
Island Department of Revenue Division of
Taxation,</EM> 313 A.3d 377, 381 (R.I. 2024). In
conducting this review, "we assume that
the facts and allegations in the complaint
are true, and we view them in the light
most favorable to the plaintiff." <EM>Id.</EM> (quoting
<EM>Pontarelli v. Rhode Island Department
of Elementary and Secondary Education,</EM>
176 A.3d 472, 476 (R.I. 2018)). A
motion to dismiss should be granted when
it is determined beyond a reasonable doubt
that the plaintiff would not be entitled to
relief under "any conceivable set of facts."
<EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>Having reviewed the record, we perceive
no error in the hearing justice's grant of
defendants' motion to dismiss. The plaintiff's
complaint contained vague and conclusory
allegations and ultimately failed to
state a claim upon which relief might be
granted. The plaintiff's short, handwritten
complaint does not contain factual allegations
of sufficient clarity and specificity to
provide a comprehensible context; what is
alleged is too vague to satisfy the requirements
of the cited Rules. Accordingly, it is
our view that the hearing justice did not
err in dismissing plaintiff's complaint.

<P20>For the reasons stated herein, we affirm
the order of the Superior Court. The record
may be returned to that tribunal.

<P20>Entered as an Order of this 7th Court
this day of January 2025.
<FN>
<fnt1> The caption of the plaintiff's complaint
names a specific Barrington police officer (Lt.
Benjamin Ferreira) in addition to the Barrington
Police Department. However, the
complaint contains no specific allegations
against or other references to that officer.

<fnt2> The record reflects that plaintiff filed various
"updates" to these documents on November
26, 2023.

<P20>APPEALED FROM: Superior Court,

[JI]
<P20>Present: REIBER, C.J., EATON,
WAPLES, JJ.
[MT]
<CN><EMBU>ENTRY ORDER</EMBU>

<P20>In the above-entitled cause, the Clerk
will enter:

<P20>&para; 1. Defendant Jaiden Green appeals the
trial court's decision to hold him without
bail under 13 V.S.A. &sect; 7553 rather than
release him into the custody of responsible
adults. We affirm.

<P20>&para; 2. In March 2024, defendant got into
an altercation with another individual in a
public area in Burlington. During the fracas,
defendant pulled out a gun, pointed it
at the individual's chest, and fired; the
bullet, however, struck the individual's arm
and did not kill him. Defendant fled but
turned himself in to police that same day.
Two days later, defendant was charged
with attempted second-degree murder in
violation of 13 V.S.A. &sect; 2301 and 13 V.S.A.
&sect; 9. He was also charged with violating
conditions of release that were imposed
under 13 V.S.A. &sect; 7554 after defendant
was charged with aggravated assault for
allegedly cutting a person's face with a
knife in December 2023.

<P20>&para; 3. In May 2024, the trial court held a
bail hearing on the attempted second-degree
murder charge. At the hearing, defendant
orally waived the weight-of-the-evidence
inquiry, conceding that the evidence
of guilt against him was great. He
instead requested the court exercise its
discretion to release him into the custody
of two proposed responsible adults, Louis
and Courtney Mongeon. The Mongeons
both testified in turn, and the trial court
then issued a ruling from the bench. The
court determined that defendant was a
flight risk and a danger to the community
based on his young age and the seriousness
of the violent charge against him. It
further concluded that, although the Mongeons
appeared to be "really good responsible
adults," defendant's risk of flight and
the threat he imposed to the community
would not be overcome by releasing him
into their custody. The trial court therefore
ordered defendant held without bail.
Defendant appeals.
<Page 771>

<P20>&para; 4. In Vermont, criminal defendants
generally have a presumptive right
to bail. <EMU>State v. Holland-Levine</EMU>, 2024 VT
25, &para; 8, ___ Vt. ___, 316 A.3d 227 (mem.).
In cases where, as here, the defendant's
alleged crime is (1) "punishable by life in
prison" and (2) the "`evidence of guilt is
great,'" "the presumption is switched so
that the norm is incarceration and not
release." <EMU>State v. Hardy</EMU>, 2008 VT 119,
&para; 10, 184 Vt. 618, 965 A.2d 478 (mem.)
(quotation omitted) (quoting 13 V.S.A.
&sect; 7553). This presumption against release
arises because we consider "a potential
sentence of life imprisonment as a proxy
for flight risk or risk to public safety."
<EMU>State v. Shores</EMU>, 2017 VT 37, &para; 22, 204 Vt.
630, 168 A.3d 471 (mem.). When this presumption
arises, the trial court must exercise
its discretion to release the defendant
or hold him without bail. <EMU>Holland-Levine</EMU>,
2024 VT 25, &para; 8, ___ Vt. ___, 316 A.3d 227
(citing <EMU>State v. Main</EMU>, 2022 VT 18, &para; 10, 216
Vt. 605, 279 A.3d 113 (mem.)). "As long as
the trial court gives the defendant an opportunity
to be heard, the trial court's
discretion is extremely broad." <EMU>Id</EMU>. (quotation
omitted).

<P20>&para; 5. Once the trial court exercises
this discretion, "we review the trial court's
decision on whether to deny bail in accordance
with the &sect; 7554(b) factors for an
abuse of discretion." <EMU>State v. Orost</EMU>, 2017
VT 110, &para; 6, 206 Vt. 657, 179 A.3d 763
(mem.) (citing <EMU>State v. Pellerin</EMU>, 2010 VT
26, &para; 13, 187 Vt. 482, 996 A.2d 204). Under
&sect; 7554(b), there are six factors that guide
the trial court: (1) "the nature and circumstances
of the offense charged," (2) "the
weight of the evidence against the accused,"
(3) "the accused's employment[]
[and] financial resources, including the accused's
ability to post bail," (4) "the accused's
character and mental condition,"
(5) "the accused's length of residence in
the community," and (6) "the accused's
record of appearance at court proceedings
or of flight to avoid prosecution or failure
to appear at court proceedings." 13 V.S.A.
&sect; 7554(b)(1). However, the trial court need
not make a rote consideration of all six
factors to properly exercise its broad discretion
to grant or deny bail. See <EMU>State v.
Ford</EMU>, 2015 VT 127, &para; 11, 200 Vt. 650, 130
A.3d 862 (mem.) ("[T]here is no requirement
that a court consider all of the factors
listed in &sect; 7554 when exercising its
discretion."); <EMU>State v. Blow</EMU>, 2020 VT 106,
&para; 20, 213 Vt. 651, 251 A.3d 517 (mem.)
("[T]he court is not required to consider all
the factors listed in &sect; 7554(b) when exercising
its broad discretion to impose bail.").
If the court determines that the factors
favor release, it may "[p]lace the defendant
in the custody of a designated person," a
responsible adult, "agreeing to supervise
him." 13 V.S.A. &sect; 7554(a)(1)(A). Release,
however, is the exception. Because at this
stage the defendant lacks a constitutional
right to bail and the presumption is
"switched so that the norm is incarceration,"
the burden is on the defendant to
prove why release is warranted. <EMU>State v.
Blackmer</EMU>, 160 Vt. 451, 458, 631 A.2d 1134,
1139 (1993); <EMU>State v. Vialet</EMU>, 2021 VT 62,
&para; 3, 215 Vt. 648, 261 A.3d 642 (mem.).

<P20>&para; 6. In the instant case, defendant
is charged with attempted second-degree
murder, which he does not dispute is a
crime "punishable by life in prison." See 13
V.S.A. &sect; 9(a) ("A person who attempts to
commit ... murder ... shall be punished
as the offense attempted to be committed
is by law punishable"); 13 V.S.A. &sect; 2303(c)
("The punishment for murder in the second
degree shall be imprisonment for
life."). Defendant likewise concedes that
the evidence of guilt against him is great.
Therefore, defendant conceded both factors
necessary for the trial court to have
discretion to hold him without bail under
<Page 772>
&sect; 7553. See <EMU>Hardy</EMU>, 2008 VT 119, &para; 10, 184
Vt. 618, 965 A.2d 478.

<P20>&para; 7. Nevertheless, defendant argues
that the trial court abused its discretion
under &sect; 7554(b) in determining not to
release defendant into the custody of the
Mongeons as responsible adults. We disagree.
The trial court relied on sufficient
facts in finding that the &sect; 7554(b) factors
in this case favored incarceration and thus
declining to release defendant into the
Mongeons' custody. See <EMU>Orost</EMU>, 2017 VT
110, &para; 6, 206 Vt. 657, 179 A.3d 763. Specifically,
the court tacitly determined that
"the weight of the evidence against the
accused" weighed in favor of his incarceration
by accepting defendant's concession
that the evidence of guilt against him is
great. The court also emphasized the risk
of flight given the gravity of the violent
attempted murder charge defendant faces
and his young age. See <EMU>State v. Benjamin</EMU>,
No. 24-AP-090, 2024 WL 1675367, at *2
(Vt. Apr. 16, 2024) (unpub. mem.) [https://perma.cc/Z7GA-L342]
(affirming reliance
on "violent nature of the charged conduct"
in support of bail decision); cf. <EMU>State v.
Lohr</EMU>, 2020 VT 41, &para; 21, 212 Vt. 289, 236
A.3d 1277 (relying on defendant's advanced
age and health issues as fact mitigating
his risk of flight).<fnr*> The court further
noted the danger imposed to the
community by releasing defendant based
on the violent charges against him, for attempting
to kill his victim by firing a gun
in a public area, as well as his previous
charge for violently attacking another person
with a large knife. See <EMU>Vialet</EMU>, 2021 VT
62, &para;&para; 5, 8, 215 Vt. 648, 261 A.3d 642
(relying on fact that "defendant was
charged with firing a weapon on a public
street" to support holding him without
bail); see also <EMU>State v. Farnsworth</EMU>, No. 23-AP-340,
2023 WL 7405071, at *3 (Vt. Nov.
3, 2023) (unpub. mem.) [https://perma.cc/X3XK-XGVQ]
(relying on defendant's prior
"violent offenses" to conclude he "posed a
danger to the public"). Lastly, the court
properly considered that release into the
Mongeon's custody would not mitigate the
above risks, even though they would make
"good responsible adults," given defendant's
violent criminal history and failure
to conform to prior conditions of release&mdash;
including prior violations of curfew and for
possession of a gun when in the custody of
a previous responsible adult. See <EMU>State v.
Boutwell</EMU>, No. 22-AP-075, 2022 WL
1210976, at *4 (Vt. Apr. 25, 2022) (unpub.
mem.) [https://perma.cc/S3DD-VKMR]
("In exercising [its] discretion, a trial
court may determine, based on adequate
findings, that no responsible adult, no
matter how well-intentioned, could ensure
the public's safety."). Defendant thus
failed to meet his burden of proving why
release is warranted in this case. See <EMU>Vialet</EMU>,
2021 VT 62, &para; 3, 215 Vt. 648, 261 A.3d
642. We therefore find no abuse of discretion
in the trial court's decision to hold
defendant without bail.

<P20>Affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt*> Defendant correctly argues that the severity of
the charges a defendant faces, ungrounded
from other factors related to that specific defendant,
is generally an insufficient basis to
conclude that a defendant is a flight risk. See
<EMU>State v. Messier</EMU>, No. 2013-192, 2013 WL
3184843, at *2 (Vt. May 31, 2013) (unpub.
mem.) [https://perma.cc/LJN7-N82F] ("In isolation,
the severity of the charges would not
provide a sufficient evidentiary basis for a
court's conclusion that a defendant poses a
flight risk."); see also <EMU>State v. LeClair</EMU>, No.
2017-357, 2017 WL 5989752, at *2 (Vt. Nov.
17, 2017) (unpub. mem.) [https://perma.cc/9L8K-WEJT]
("The mere accumulation of
charges&mdash;even if of a serious nature&mdash;cannot
be the lone basis for setting bail."). As noted
above, however, the court here did not consider
the severity of the charges defendant
faces as its sole factor.

<P20>&para; 1. In this interlocutory appeal, defendant
Eileen Ettore challenges the trial
court's denial of her motion to suppress an
evidentiary breath-alcohol test, which she
filed in both her criminal and civil dockets.
We reverse the court's decision and remand
for additional proceedings in the
criminal case and for entry of judgment in
defendant's favor in the civil-suspension
proceedings.

<CN>I. Background

<P20>&para; 2. The trial court made the following
findings in ruling on defendant's motion to
suppress. In March 2022, a police officer
arrested defendant on suspicion of driving
under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Defendant
was processed for DUI at the
stationhouse and the processing was recorded
on closed-circuit television.
<Page 775>

<P20>&para; 3. The officer read defendant language
from an informed-consent form, which is a
template form used by law enforcement to
process DUI suspects. One portion of the
form contains the implied-consent warnings
set forth in 23 V.S.A. &sect; 1202(d)(1)-(6),
along with boxes to check as each item is
read. See <EMU>id</EMU>. &sect; 1202(d) (listing pretest disclosures
of statutory information such as
right to take independent test at own expense
after processing, right to speak with
on-call attorney to discuss approach to
test, right to elect to take second test,
consequences flowing from test results exceeding
statutory limits, and penalty for
refusal to test if person has prior DUI).

<P20>&para; 4. The officer recited&mdash;and checked as
completed&mdash;the warnings, including the
following: "if you submit to an evidentiary
test administered with an infrared device,
following your receipt of the results of
that test, you have a right to a second evidentiary
test administered by me using
the infrared device." Defendant verbally
indicated that she understood each of her
informed-consent rights, waived the opportunity
to speak with an on-call defense attorney
before deciding whether to take the
evidentiary test, and signed her name to
the document representing that waiver.

<P20>&para; 5. Defendant agreed to provide a
breath sample. While the Datamaster
DMT machine was processing her sample
but before defendant was provided with
the test result, the officer said, "So, it's
going to ask you if you would like to do a
second one. You don't have to. That one
was good enough." He asked defendant,
"Do you want to provide another sample?
You don't have to." Defendant replied,
"No." Approximately ninety seconds later,
the officer told defendant that her result
was .121, which exceeded the legal blood
alcohol limit of .08. The officer asked defendant
if she wanted to obtain an independent
blood test at her own expense.
Defendant declined.

<P20>&para; 6. The State charged defendant with
DUI #2 and negligent operation of a motor
vehicle, and separately opened civil-suspension
proceedings. Defendant moved
to suppress the breath-test result in both
dockets. The court held a hearing on the
motion at which the officer was the sole
witness to testify. Defendant raised various
arguments, including that the officer
violated her implied-consent rights by asking
her if she wanted a second test before
informing her of the results of the first
test.

<P20>&para; 7. The court denied defendant's motion.
It concluded in relevant part that the
officer clearly informed defendant of her
implied-consent rights before she took the
evidentiary breath test, including her right
to request a second breath test upon receiving
the results of the first. After taking
the first test, defendant was asked if she
wanted to take a second test and she unequivocally
declined. When defendant was
subsequently informed of the result of the
first test, she did not then invoke her right
to request a second test.

<P20>&para; 8. The court concluded that, under the
plain language of &sect; 1202(d), defendant's
right to be informed about the ability to
elect a second breath test matured at the
time the officer requested an evidentiary
breath sample under &sect; 1202(a)(1). It found
no evidence to suggest that the officer
acted in bad faith or that defendant misunderstood
her right to request a second
test upon receiving the results of the first
test. It saw nothing in the facts to demonstrate
that defendant's ability to elect a
second test had changed objectively or
subjectively between the request and the
opportunity to elect. The court reasoned
that defendant had the opportunity to request
a second test at the time she was
informed of the results of the first test
<Page 776>
and did not do so. It denied defendant's
motion to suppress as well as her motion
for reconsideration. This interlocutory appeal
followed.

<P20>&para; 9. Defendant raises numerous arguments
on appeal. We agree with her
assertion that, under the plain language of
23 V.S.A. &sect;&sect; 1202(d)(5) and 1203(c), law
enforcement must provide a suspect with
the results of their first breath test before
requiring the suspect to elect whether to
take a second test. That did not occur
here. Because we reverse the trial court's
decision on this basis, we do not reach
defendant's remaining arguments.

<CN>II. Analysis

<P20>&para; 10. "A motion to suppress evidence
presents a mixed question of fact
and law." <EMU>State v. Bauder</EMU>, 2007 VT 16, &para; 9,
181 Vt. 392, 924 A.2d 38. We will "uphold
the trial court's factual findings absent
clear error," and "we review the trial
court's conclusions of law de novo." <EMU>Id</EMU>.
(quotation omitted). The court's factual
findings are largely unchallenged. Our interpretation
of 23 V.S.A. &sect;&sect; 1202(d) and
1203(c) presents a legal question that we
review de novo.

<P20>&para; 11. While motorists on Vermont
highways "impliedly consent to a breath
test" if they are suspected of driving under
the influence, they are afforded protections
by statute, "referred to as `implied consent
rights.'" <EMU>State v. Coburn</EMU>, 2006 VT 31,
&para; 10, 179 Vt. 448, 898 A.2d 128. "Among
these are the warnings listed in 23 V.S.A.
&sect; 1202(d), which are to be given by the
arresting officer" at the time an evidentiary
breath test is requested. <EMU>Id</EMU>.

<P20>&para; 12. As indicated above, an officer must
inform a suspect, among other things, that:

<B22>A person who is requested by a law
enforcement officer to submit to an evidentiary
test administered with an infrared
breath-testing instrument may elect
to have a second infrared test administered
immediately after receiving the results
of the first test.

<P00>23 V.S.A. &sect; 1202(d)(5). Section 1203(c) similarly
provides that "[a] person tested with
an infrared breath-testing instrument shall
have the option of having a second infrared
test administered immediately after receiving
the results of the first test." We have
recognized that "[t]he second test serves
the obvious purpose of verifying the accuracy
of the first." <EMU>State v. Spooner</EMU>, 2012
VT 90, &para; 15, 192 Vt. 465, 60 A.3d 640.

<P20>&para; 13. In interpreting these laws,
we strive to implement the Legislature's
intent and "[t]he definitive source of legislative
intent is the statutory language, by
which we are bound unless it is uncertain
or unclear." <EMU>In re Bennington Sch., Inc.</EMU>,
2004 VT 6, &para; 12, 176 Vt. 584, 845 A.2d 332
(mem.). We assume the Legislature intended
the plain and ordinary meaning of
the language it used, <EMU>State v. LeBlanc</EMU>, 171
Vt. 88, 91, 759 A.2d 991, 993 (2000), and
"we will not read words into a statute that
are not there, unless it is necessary in
order to make the statute effective," <EMU>State
v. Hale</EMU>, 2021 VT 18, &para; 14, 214 Vt. 296, 256
A.3d 595 (quotation omitted) (alteration
omitted).

<P20>&para; 14. We conclude, based on
the plain language of the laws above, that
the Legislature clearly intended that suspects
possess the necessary information to
make an informed decision about the exercise
of their statutory rights. This gives
meaning to the right. See <EMU>State v. Sherwood</EMU>,
174 Vt. 27, 31, 800 A.2d 463, 466
(2002) (recognizing that exercise of right
set forth in 23 V.S.A. &sect; 1202(c) must "be
meaningful"). Under the statute, a police
officer has an affirmative obligation to provide
the results of the first test to a suspect.
The law does not require suspects to
request these results. The statutory trigger
<Page 777>
for the exercise of the right to a
second test is receipt of the results of the
first test. This implements the verification
purpose of the second test. Until one
knows the results of the first test, there is
nothing to verify.

<P20>&para; 15. This interpretation makes sense.
Without the results of the first test, a
suspect cannot make an informed choice
about whether additional verification is
needed. The suspect might choose to take
a second test, unaware that the first did
not demonstrate impairment. Alternatively,
they might decline a second test, unaware
that the first test showed impairment.
A suspect who has made the weighty
decision to submit to an evidentiary breath
test is entitled to make a knowledgeable
decision about whether to exercise their
statutory right to a second breath test. See
<EMU>State v. Lynaugh</EMU>, 158 Vt. 72, 75, 604 A.2d
785, 786-87 (1992) (recognizing that "the
decision whether to take a breath test
should not be lightly decided" (quotation
omitted)).

<P20>&para; 16. This interpretation gives meaning
to the right, implements the plain language
used by the Legislature, and serves the
law's purpose. It is also consistent with the
Vermont Criminal Justice Training Council's
implementation of 23 V.S.A.
&sect;&sect; 1202(d)(5) and 1203 in the standard
DUI Affidavit-Infrared. That form
prompts the officer to provide and note the
results of the first test before asking the
suspect if they would like a second test.

<P20>&para; 17. The process laid out by statute
was not followed here. In this case, the
officer asked defendant if she wanted a
second test before she was provided the
results of the first test. After defendant
completed the first test, the officer explained
that the machine would "ask if you
would like to do a second one," but "[y]ou
don't have to"; "[t]hat one was good
enough." He asked again if defendant
wanted to take a second test and reiterated
"you don't have to." Defendant then
declined to take the second test. The officer's
conduct and advice were inconsistent
with the implied-consent law, and without
the test results, defendant could not make
a fully informed decision about whether to
request a second test. Although the officer
provided defendant the results of her first
test about a minute and a half after she
declined a second test, she had already
been asked for her election as to the second
test and was not asked again. Because
this occurred, it was not defendant's burden,
when she was subsequently provided
with the results, to tell the officer she had
changed her mind and now wanted to elect
a second test. She was asked to decide
about a second test prematurely, in a way
that was inconsistent with the statute, and
her election had been made. The trial
court erred in concluding that defendant's
ability to elect to take a second test did not
"change[] either objectively or subjectively
between the request and the opportunity
to elect."<fnr1>

<P20>&para; 18. Because the implied-consent procedure
was not followed here, defendant's
motion to suppress should have been
granted. While the officer did not act in
bad faith, his conduct violated defendant's
right to make an informed decision in response
to the officer's request as to whether
she wanted a second test. We conclude
that this warrants suppression. See <EMU>State
v. Vezina</EMU>, 2004 VT 62, &para;&para; 6, 8, 177 Vt. 488,
857 A.2d 313 (mem.) (stating that suppression
is appropriate where there is a "deliberate
deprivation of statutory rights" because
<Page 778>
it would prevent "the State [from]
tak[ing] advantage of its own violation of
the law" (quotation omitted)); see also
<EMU>State v. McCrossen</EMU>, 129 Wis.2d 277,385
N.W.2d 161, 170 (1986) (concluding that
"suppression of blood alcohol test results"
was appropriate "sanction for violating a
defendant's statutory right to an alternative
blood alcohol test," recognizing that
"second test does help assure fairness,"
"legislature intended the second test as a
check on the reliability of a first test," and
court would "strictly enforce the right to a
second test").<fnr2> Defendant had a right under
the statute to make an informed decision
about whether to take a second test
and it is unknown what a second test
might have revealed, creating an irreparable
harm. Under these circumstances, the
State should not be allowed "to take advantage
of its own violation of the law."
<EMU>Vezina</EMU>, 2004 VT 62, &para; 6, 177 Vt. 488, 857
A.2d 313 (quotation omitted).

<P20>&para; 19. While not binding on this Court,
we note that numerous trial judges have
reached a similar conclusion. See, e.g.,
<EMU>State v. Jerome</EMU>, Nos. 1010-8-19 Bncr, 58-8-19
Bncs (Vt. Super. Ct. Oct. 14, 2020)
(Valente, J.) (concluding that defendant
entitled to favorable decision in civil-suspension
proceedings and suppression of evidentiary
breath test where officer failed to
inform suspect of results of his first evidentiary
test before informing him of right
to second evidentiary test) (citing cases
including <EMU>State v. Lussier</EMU>, Nos. 661-6-09
FrCr, 60-5-09 FrCs (Vt. Super. Ct. Oct. 8,
2009) (Kupersmith, J.) (suppressing evidentiary
breath tests where defendant initially
declined second test before learning
of first result)).

<P20>&para; 20. Mindful of the important rights at
stake, and the critical need for informed
decisionmaking recognized by the Legislature,
we reverse the trial court's decision
in this case.<fnr3> Defendant is therefore entitled
to judgment in her favor in the civil-suspension
proceedings and we remand
the civil matter for entry of such judgment.
See 23 V.S.A. &sect; 1205(h)(1)(E) (recognizing
that court must determine if State
complied with requirements of &sect; 1202 at
final civil-suspension hearing); <EMU>Spooner</EMU>,
2012 VT 90, &para; 16, 192 Vt. 465, 60 A.3d 640
(explaining that "civil-suspension statute
clearly calls on the trial judge to review
... compliance with &sect; 1202," and judgment
in defendant's favor warranted if State
"fail[s] to carry its burden to establish
compliance with &sect; 1202"). Granting the
motion to suppress does not dispose of the
two pending criminal charges against defendant,
however, and the criminal case is
thus remanded for additional proceedings.
See <EMU>State v. Gilman</EMU>, 173 Vt. 110, 118, 787
A.2d 1238, 1244 (2001) (reaching similar
conclusion).

<P20><EMU>Reversed and remanded for additional
proceedings</EMU>.
[DJ]
<P20><author>CARROLL</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>, dissenting.
[DT]
<P20>&para; 21. In considering legislative intent
expressed in unambiguous language, our
precedents, credibility determinations
made by the trial judges, and the arguments
presented to us on appeal, I come to
<Page 779>
a different conclusion than the majority.
None of these support the majority's new,
bright-line rule for suppressing an evidentiary
breath test under 23 V.S.A.
&sect; 1202(d)(5). I respectfully dissent.

<P20>&para; 22. Our overriding goal when interpreting
a statute is to give effect to the
Legislature's intent. <EMU>State v. Deyo</EMU>, 2006
VT 120, &para; 14, 181 Vt. 89, 915 A.2d 249. We
presume that the Legislature expresses its
intent using plain and ordinary language.
<EMU>T.C. v. L.D.</EMU>, 2020 VT 19, &para; 4, 211 Vt. 582,
229 A.3d 77. If that plain, ordinary language
is unambiguous, our inquiry ends,
and we implement the statute as written.
<EMU>Id</EMU>.

<P20>&para; 23. The relevant language in the informed-consent
statute is as follows:

<B42>At the time a test is requested, the
person shall be informed of the following
statutory information: ...

<B42>A person who is requested by a law
enforcement officer to submit to an evidentiary
test administered with an infrared
breath-testing instrument may elect
to have a second infrared test administered
immediately after receiving the results
of the first test.

<P00>23 V.S.A. &sect; 1202(d)(5). The testing statute
contains substantially the same language.
See <EMU>id</EMU>. &sect; 1203(c) ("A person tested with an
infrared breath-testing instrument shall
have the option of having a second infrared
test administered immediately after receiving
the results of the first test."). These
statutes together make two things clear.
First, before the police officer administers
the first test, the officer must warn the
suspect that the suspect can elect to take a
second test immediately following receipt
of the first test result. Second, a police
officer must not intentionally deprive a
suspect of the right to take a second test
immediately following receipt of the first
test result.

<P20>&para; 24. Contrary to the majority's holding,
neither statute requires an officer to ask a
suspect after the first test is administered
if they would like to take a second test.
<EMU>Ante</EMU>, &para; 14. The verb "elect" in &sect; 1202(d)(5)
gives the suspect the choice to take another
test but puts no duty on the police
officer to prompt the suspect to make that
choice. See <EMU>Elect</EMU>, Merriam-Webster Online
Dictionary [https://perma.cc/EM9C-EBHY]
(defining transitive verb form of
"elect" as "to make a selection of" or "to
choose (something, such as a course of
action) especially by preference"). Unlike
in &sect; 1202(d), the Legislature did not use
words such as "ask," "inquire," "request,"
or the like in either &sect;&sect; 1202(d)(5) or
1203(c). See 23 V.S.A. &sect; 1202(d) ("At the
time a test is <EMU>requested</EMU>, the person <EMU>shall</EMU>
be informed of the following statutory information."
(emphasis added)). To the extent
that the Legislature intended such a
requirement but did not expressly say so,
our rule is to decline to add extra words
into unambiguous language. <EMU>State v. Hale</EMU>,
2021 VT 18, &para; 14, 214 Vt. 296, 256 A.3d 595
("It is a well settled principle of statutory
construction that we will not read words
into a statute that are not there, unless it
is <EMU>necessary</EMU> in order to make the statute
effective." (quotation and brackets omitted)
(emphasis added)).

<P20>&para; 25. The majority reasons that
&sect; 1203(c)'s "shall have the option of having
a second infrared test administered immediately
after receiving the results of the
first test" means that the DUI processing
officer-Springfield Police Officer Perkins-was
required to ask defendant about
her decision to take a second test after
disclosing the first test result. <EMU>Ante</EMU>, &para; 14. I
disagree. Read together with &sect; 1202(d),
"shall have the option" means that a law-enforcement
officer must instead not intentionally
deprive a suspect of the option
at the appropriate time. See <EMU>State v. A.P.</EMU>,
2021 VT 90, &para; 12, 216 Vt. 76, 268 A.3d 58
<Page 780>
("We do not read statutory language in
isolation; we read and construe together
the whole and every part of the statute,
together with other statutes standing in
pari materia with it, as parts of a unified
statutory system." (quotation omitted));
<EMU>State v. Spooner</EMU>, 2012 VT 90, &para; 15, 192 Vt.
465, 60 A.3d 640 (construing informed-consent
statute and civil-suspension statute in
light of each other).

<P20>&para; 26. The majority's focus on informed
decisionmaking goes beyond what our
precedents require. <EMU>Ante</EMU>, &para;&para; 15, 17-18. As
we have repeatedly held, "all that is required
to satisfy the [informed-consent]
right is that the warning convey" the provisions
in &sect; 1202(d). <EMU>State v. Coburn</EMU>, 2006
VT 31, &para; 11, 179 Vt. 448, 898 A.2d 128
(concluding that provision in informed-consent
form advising of consequences of refusing
to take evidentiary test "adequately
conveys the information required" under
statute, and defendant's argument that
warning was too confusing lacked merit in
part because defendant contemporaneously
confirmed that he understood warning);
see <EMU>State v. Lynaugh</EMU>, 158 Vt. 72, 74, 604
A.2d 785, 786 (1992) ("Defendant received
all the advice required by &sect; 1202(d), and
we decline to require more.").

<P20>&para; 27. In my view, this case is controlled
by <EMU>State v. Vezina</EMU>, 2004 VT 62, 177 Vt.
488, 857 A.2d 313 (mem.). There, the defendant
elected to take a second test but
the Datamaster DMT machine malfunctioned
and a second test was never obtained.
The defendant was appropriately
advised of his right to obtain an independent
test at his own expense, which he
declined.<fnr4> He moved to suppress the result
of the first test. We refused to extend the
suppression remedy to a violation of
&sect; 1202(d)(5) because, unlike the statutory
right to counsel in (d)(4), a violation of
(d)(5) does not result in the State capitalizing
on its own violation of the law. <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 6.
We explained that an "inability to produce
a second test" does not compare "with the
irreparable harm caused by the State's
actions in denying a defendant's right to
counsel during DUI processing, particularly
in light of defendant's ability to challenge
the instrument's reliability," including
by seeking independent testing. <EMU>Id</EMU>. We
held that, at minimum, a defendant would
have to demonstrate bad-faith conduct by
the police officer and prejudice to prevail
on a suppression motion involving an alleged
violation of &sect; 1202(d)(5). <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 8. Our
holding in <EMU>Vezina</EMU> is directly applicable
here:

<B22>We discern no reason to extend the remedy
of suppression where ... there is no
evidence that performance of the instrument
affected the validity of the first
[blood alcohol content] result, there is no
claim of bad faith on the part of the
officers, and defendant has been properly
advised of his right to additional independent
testing.

<P00><EMU>Id</EMU>. Here, defendant has not challenged the
validity of the first test. The court found
that Officer Perkins did not act in bad
faith (defendant does not challenge that
finding on appeal), and defendant was apprised
of her right to additional testing.

<P20>&para; 28. It is because defendant has not
challenged the validity of the first test that
<EMU>State v. Spooner</EMU>, relied upon by the majority,
has limited bearing on this case.
2012 VT 90, 192 Vt. 465, 60 A.3d 640. In
<EMU>Spooner</EMU>, the defendant elected to take a
second test after learning the first test
result was .101. The second test returned a
"standard out of range" reading, and the
third test reported an "invalid sample." <EMU>Id</EMU>.
&para; 3. The fourth test result was .109. The
<Page 781>
State sought civil suspension of the defendant's
license. We affirmed the trial court's
dismissal of the civil-suspension complaint
because the officer had failed to operate
the Datamaster DMT machine in accordance
with the Department of Health's
operational manual by continuing to test
after the machine experienced a "fatal error."
<EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 12. We agreed with the trial
court that, in the absence of the valid and
reliable second test result that the defendant
had requested, the State could not
prove a necessary element required by the
civil-suspension statute. <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para;&para; 13-14 (citing
23 V.S.A. &sect; 1205(h)(1)(D)).

<P20>&para; 29. We explained in <EMU>Spooner</EMU> that the
second test serves the "obvious purpose"
of confirming the reliability of the first
test. <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 15. But the necessary corollary
to that statement is that a person must
actually elect to take a second test. <EMU>Id</EMU>.
("[R]ead in light of one another, [the civil-suspension
statute and the informed-consent
statute] dictate that <EMU>if</EMU> a person elects
to have a second test, the methods of that
test are reviewable for validity and reliability
by the court at a final civil-suspension
hearing." (emphasis added)). If reliability
of the first test was always in issue
in every case, then there would be no need
to provide an election to take a second
test, and that provision would be mere
surplusage. See <EMU>State v. Taylor</EMU>, 2015 VT
104, &para; 10, 200 Vt. 96, 129 A.3d 660 ("We do
not construe the statute in a way that
renders a significant part of it pure surplusage."
(quotation omitted)). In <EMU>Spooner</EMU>,
we distinguished <EMU>Vezina</EMU>, explaining that "a
valid second test was not an element of the
criminal drunk-driving charge" at issue in
<EMU>Vezina</EMU> as it was in <EMU>Spooner</EMU>, and that
<EMU>Vezina</EMU> involved the admissibility of the
breath test, not the absence of a sufficiently
reliable second test. 2012 VT 90, &para; 17,
192 Vt. 465, 60 A.3d 640. <EMU>Spooner</EMU> does not
help defendant here.

<P20>&para; 30. Defendant has not attempted to
show that she was prejudiced by her own
decision to stop at the first test or that the
first test result was faulty. See <EMU>State v.
Roya</EMU>, 174 Vt. 451, 452-53, 807 A.2d 371,
373 (2002) (mem.) (explaining rule that defendant
must introduce some evidence of
prejudice to warrant suppression of test
result); <EMU>State v. Hamm</EMU>, 157 Vt. 666, 667,
599 A.2d 1048, 1049 (1991) (mem.) (explaining
that where defendant challenging civil
suspension on basis that police officer
failed to inform defendant of statutory
right to counsel, defendant bore "burden
of production on the issue of prejudice,

(holding that defendant's
argument to suppress test on
grounds that officer acted in bad faith
failed because record supported trial
court's findings that officer acted in good
faith and defendant did not demonstrate
prejudice).

<P20>&para; 31. Nonetheless, the majority makes
the prejudicial-error argument for defendant,
holding that defendant had a right to
a second test because "it is unknown what
a second test might have revealed, creating
an irreparable harm." <EMU>Ante</EMU>, &para; 18. We
held precisely the opposite in <EMU>Vezina</EMU>: that
suppression was not warranted where the
defendant actually requested a second test,
and a second test could not be produced.
2004 VT 62, &para; 8, 177 Vt. 488, 857 A.2d 313.
I cannot square up how this case falls
outside <EMU>Vezina</EMU>'s framework.
<Page 782>

<P20>&para; 32. The majority's explanation that
Officer Perkins, even in the absence of bad
faith, deliberately deprived defendant of a
right to a second test effectively overrules
<EMU>Vezina</EMU>. <EMU>Ante</EMU>, &para; 18. In <EMU>Vezina</EMU>, we held that
there was no evidence of a deliberate deprivation
of statutory rights; in other
words, there was nothing to suggest that
the State was capitalizing on its own violation
of the law. <EMU>Id</EMU>. (citing <EMU>State v. McCrossen</EMU>,
129 Wis.2d 277, 385 N.W.2d 161
(1986), where defendant requested second
test not believing result of first test, but
police officers kept defendant in jail, never
administered second test, and never informed
defendant she could be released to
get independent, second test). The majority's
holding, analogizing this case to
<EMU>McCrossen</EMU> for the proposition that the
State should not be allowed to capitalize on
its own violation of law, rewrites our implied-consent
case law. In my view, <EMU>Vezina</EMU>
would no longer be good law in light of the
majority's reasoning.

<P20>&para; 33. Indeed, I believe that the majority's
new bright-line rule for suppression
irrespective of whether the suspect can
demonstrate bad faith and prejudice will
undermine significant portions of our implied-consent
precedents. In addition to
<EMU>Vezina</EMU>, <EMU>Coburn</EMU> does not appear to survive
this case. See 2006 VT 31, &para; 11, 179 Vt.
448, 898 A.2d 128 ("Because the right to
advisement under 23 V.S.A. &sect; 1202(d) goes
above and beyond any due process requirement
of statutory clarity (in that the
majority of suspects receive no warning
whatsoever before committing a crime, but
are nonetheless held accountable to criminal
sanctions prescribed in Vermont's statutes),
all that is required to satisfy this
right is that the warning convey the information
listed in 23 V.S.A. &sect; 1202(d).)."
<EMU>Lynaugh</EMU> does not appear to survive this
case. See 158 Vt. at 76, 604 A.2d at 787
(reversing suppression order where defendant
was adequately apprised of consequences
of submitting to breath test under
&sect; 1202(d)). <EMU>State v. Nemkovich</EMU> does not
appear to survive this case. See 168 Vt. 8,
13, 712 A.2d 899, 902 (1998) (reversing
suppression order where trooper read defendant
implied-consent rights from processing
form and defendant acknowledged
that he understood his rights). <EMU>West</EMU> does
not appear to survive this case. 151 Vt. at
142, 557 A.2d at 875 (requiring defendant
to bear burden of proving prejudicial error
and refusing to suppress test where officer
correctly disclosed information on informed-consent
form but also gave defendant
erroneous information).

<P20>&para; 34. In sum, as even the majority concedes,
&sect; 1202(d)(5) and &sect; 1203(c) required
that Officer Perkins advise defendant of
her right to take a second test when Officer
Perkins requested the first evidentiary
test. There is no dispute Officer Perkins
advised defendant of this right. But now,
for the first time, the majority holds that
appropriately disclosing the implied-consent
warnings under the statute is not
enough. Instead, elevating form over substance,
it requires the officer to again ask
the suspect by rote about a second test
after disclosing the results from the first
test. After today, a defendant can now
colorably argue to suppress a test result
where the officer did not readvise her that
she may be subject to criminal charges or
civil suspension if the first test result was
over the legal limit, &sect; 1202(d)(3), or the
officer did not readvise her of her right to
get an independent test, &sect; 1202(d)(4), or
did not readvise her of a location to get an
independent test, <EMU>id</EMU>. Moreover, for the
first time, the majority does not require a
showing of bad faith or prejudice to suppress
a breath test.<fnr5> Indeed, the majority
no longer requires a defendant to even
<EMU>argue</EMU> bad faith or prejudice to suppress a
<Page 783>
breath test. Cf. <EMU>Rowe v. Brown</EMU>, 157 Vt.
373, 379, 599 A.2d 333, 337 (1991) ("Issues
not raised on appeal are deemed
waived.").<fnr6> Instead, for the first time, suppression
is mandatory if the officer deviates
in the slightest way from reminding a
defendant what was already disclosed to
the defendant and to which the defendant
already affirmatively acknowledged.<fnr7> I
submit that this result goes beyond the
relevant statutes, our precedents, the trial
court's credibility determinations, and defendant's
own arguments on appeal.

<P20>&para; 35. I must respectfully dissent.

<P20>&para; 36. I am authorized to state that
Justice Waples joins this dissent.
<FN>
<fnt1> We base our conclusion on the particular
facts of this case and do not hold, as a matter
of law, that police officers must ask suspects
in each case if they want to take a second
breath test.

<fnt2> We have concluded that suppression can be
an appropriate remedy for a violation of the
law in the absence of bad faith. See, e.g.,
<EMU>State v. Garvey</EMU>, 157 Vt. 105, 106, 595 A.2d
267, 268 (1991) (concluding that suppression
warranted in civil-suspension refusal case
where police officer attempted to contact numerous
attorneys on DUI defendant's behalf
as required by law but was unsuccessful).

<fnt3> Following oral argument, defendant filed a
supplemental brief, which the State opposed.
This supplemental brief was not authorized
under the rules and we have not considered it
in reaching our decision.

<fnt4> Here, Officer Perkins appropriately advised
defendant that she could take an independent
test at her own expense, which she also declined.

<fnt5> The majority correctly cites <EMU>State v. Garvey</EMU>,
157 Vt. 105, 595 A.2d 267 (1991), for the
proposition that we have not required bad-faith
conduct to suppress a breath test in
every case. <EMU>Ante</EMU>, &para; 18, n.2. However, <EMU>Garvey</EMU>
involved the inability of the State to provide
legal counsel to a DUI suspect. As we explained
in <EMU>Vezina</EMU>, the "inability to produce a
second test sequence"&mdash;or here, a decision
not to take a second test&mdash;does not compare
"with the irreparable harm caused by the
State's actions in denying a defendant's right
to counsel during DUI processing." 2004 VT
62, &para; 6, 177 Vt. 488, 857 A.2d 313. Defendant
waived her right to counsel, and she does not
otherwise contend that the State denied her
the right to legal counsel during the DUI
processing.

<fnt6> Even if I agreed with the majority about
what &sect; 1202(d)(5) and &sect; 1203(c) mean, I
would still not join its opinion today because
defendant has not presented arguments sufficient
to grant the relief she seeks. This Court
is bound by the trial court's credibility determinations.
See <EMU>State v. Arrington</EMU>, 2010 VT
87, &para; 9, 188 Vt. 460, 8 A.3d 483 (explaining
that Supreme Court defers to "trier of fact's
decision to credit a particular witness" (quotation
omitted)). I firmly reject the notion that
we can ignore the fact that defendant has not
challenged the court's finding of good-faith
conduct <EMU>and</EMU> has not briefed an argument
describing how she was prejudiced by her
decision to stop at the first test. Moreover,
defendant has not argued that the Court
should abandon its longstanding requirements
that defendants must at least show bad-faith
conduct and prejudice to suppress evidentiary
breath tests. See <EMU>Rowe</EMU>, 157 Vt. at
378-79, 599 A.2d at 336-37.

<fnt7> I note that Officer Perkins asked defendant
about a second test ninety seconds before she
received the first test result. That this means
the first test result will be suppressed because
Officer Perkins should have waited ninety
more seconds before doing so, pointing up the
unworkability of the majority's new rule. At
the very least, there should be some assessment
of the totality of the circumstances in
reviewing these suppression motions. See
<EMU>Vezina</EMU>, 2004 VT 62, &para;&para; 6-8, 177 Vt. 488, 857
A.2d 313 (citing some factors courts may consider
in evaluating suppression of breath test
under &sect; 1202(d)(5), including presence of
bad-faith conduct, prejudicial error, whether
suspect obtained independent test, whether
suspect challenged result of first test, and
whether suspect was adequately apprised of
all rights under &sect; 1202(d)).

[MT]
<P20>&para; 1. Petitioner Ivo Skoric challenges the
Department of Labor's decision declining
<Page 785>
to provide him with a declaratory ruling as
to whether off-duty, medical cannabis use
constitutes "misconduct" such that a claimant
is disqualified from receiving unemployment
security benefits. Because the
Department properly declined to issue a
declaratory ruling, we affirm.

<P20>&para; 2. The following facts are undisputed.
Petitioner worked part-time as a bus fueler
and washer at Marble Valley Regional
Transit (MVRT) for approximately four
years. Petitioner underwent a preemployment
drug screen per Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) regulations and successfully
passed. At the outset of his employment,
petitioner also signed an acknowledgement
that he received and was
familiar with MVRT's drug and alcohol
policy, which provided notice of random
drug testing and mandated termination of
an employee for "a verified positive drug
test result." Petitioner's role was a "safety
sensitive" position and he was required to
possess a Commercial Driver's License
(CDL) and operate buses on occasion. Petitioner
was issued a medical marijuana
card based on a referral from his treating
physician in early 2020. In December
2022, MVRT notified petitioner that he
was required to participate in a random
drug test. The results indicated that petitioner
tested positive for marijuana.
MVRT terminated petitioner on January
9, 2023, for violating U.S. Department of
Transportation and FTA regulations.

<P20>&para; 3. Petitioner subsequently applied for
unemployment benefits on January 11,
2023, which a claims adjudicator reviewed
and denied on March 17, 2023. The denial
letter informed petitioner that his claim for
unemployment benefits was denied because
his discharge was premised on misconduct.
Petitioner appealed that determination
to an administrative law judge
(ALJ). Following a hearing on April 20,
2023, the ALJ left the record open for the
parties to submit additional evidence until
a later date. MVRT submitted additional
documents including the drug-test results,
the workplace drug policy, and communications
between MVRT and petitioner following
the drug test. Petitioner, through
counsel, also submitted a rebuttal challenging
admission of the additional documents.
On May 2, 2023, after consideration of the
additional submissions, the ALJ issued an
order affirming the claims adjudicator's
determination that petitioner was discharged
for cause but reduced the benefit
disqualification period to a statutory minimum
of six weeks in recognition of petitioner's
use of cannabis for medical purposes.

<P20>&para; 4. Petitioner then filed a document
with the Employment Security Board on
May 24, 2023, registering his disagreement
with portions of the ALJ decision. In the
document, petitioner stated that he was
"prepared to waive [his] right to appeal
under ESB Rule 15 and in lieu of that
appeal[,] petition the [Board] for a declaratory
ruling and amendment of rules under
Rule 1." He sought a declaratory ruling
"on the applicability of the misconduct disqualification
provision in 21 V.S.A.
&sect; 1344(a)(I)(A) to the off-duty use of medical
cannabis." The Board construed this
filing as a notice of appeal pursuant to
Board Rule 15, and scheduled a hearing
for July 25, 2023, before the Board. See
Employment Security Board Rules, Rule
14(A), Code of Vt. Rules 24 005 001 [hereinafter
ESB Rules], https://labor.vermont.gov/sites/labor/files/doc_library/EmploymentSecurityBoardRules_Amended_Effective10.01.19.pdf
[https://perma.cc/CC37-FLQK]. At the hearing,
petitioner waived his right to oral argument,
instead providing a written statement
noting "this is not per se an appeal
under ESB Rule 15, but a petition to the
[Board] for a declaratory ruling and
amendment of rules under Rule 1."
<Page 786>

<P20>&para; 5. The Board issued an order affirming
the ALJ's decision to deny benefits on
September 11, 2023. It first addressed petitioner's
argument that the ALJ erred by
allowing additional evidence to be submitted
by MVRT after the hearing. The
Board determined that the decision was
consistent with its own rules that allow the
ALJ to "take such additional evidence as is
deemed necessary, provided that where
additional evidence is so taken, the parties
shall be given an opportunity of examining,
cross-examining, and refuting such evidence."
See ESB Rule 14(I)(4). Because
petitioner was provided with an opportunity
to respond to MVRT, and in fact did so
respond, the Board determined that consideration
of the submitted evidence was
not in error. Considering the merits, the
Board determined that petitioner had engaged
in misconduct because he was aware
of MVRT's drug policy and still consciously
violated it, regardless of his motivation
for doing so. The Board reasoned that
because FTA regulations may endanger
MVRT's federal funding if it fails to maintain
a drug-free workplace, petitioner necessarily
exhibited a "substantial disregard
of the employer's interest," satisfying the
definition of misconduct. Petitioner filed a
motion to reconsider pursuant to ESB
Rule 15, arguing that the Board failed to
consider his prior filing as a petition for a
declaratory ruling. In an October 18 order,
the Board denied petitioner's motion to
reconsider, determining that petitioner had
failed to show any basis for reconsideration
such as plain error, fraud, or newly
discovered evidence. It opined that ESB
Rule 1(A)(1) allows the Board to consider
requests for a declaratory ruling and respond
within a reasonable time but does
not require the Board to respond to a
petition raising the same issues as a live
benefit appeal. Thus, it found no error in
its decision affirming the ALJ and declined
to reopen the appeal.

<P20>&para; 6. After receiving the Board's order,
petitioner contacted the Board via email to
register his disappointment that it again
did not issue a decision on his petition for
a declaratory ruling. In an October 27,
2023 order, the Board declined to issue a
declaratory ruling, noting that to do so
would have no bearing on petitioner's appeal
because his violation of written workplace
policy stood as an independent
source of disqualifying misconduct. The
Board noted that it had already addressed
the issue presented by petitioner in petitioner's
appeal. Petitioner also requested
that the Board amend ESB Rule 29, regarding
a claimant with disabilities, to provide
that disabled individuals terminated
for the use of legally sanctioned medication
to treat their disability are not considered
discharged for misconduct. The
Board declined to initiate rulemaking, citing
an active study pursuant to legislative
action, which directed the Department to
study the impacts of expanded unemployment
eligibility for urgent, compelling, or
necessitous reasons. See 2023, No. 76, &sect; 44
(requiring Commissioner of Labor to submit
report regarding "the potential impact
of extending eligibility for unemployment
insurance benefits to individuals who separate
from employment due to urgent, compelling,
or necessitous circumstances").
The Board noted that rulemaking would be
inappropriate before the completion of the
study.

<P20>&para; 7. Petitioner filed a notice of appeal on
November 20, 2023, purporting to appeal
the October 18, 2023 decision of the Board
declining to reconsider its previous ruling
affirming the denial of benefits because
petitioner was terminated for misconduct.
This Court dismissed petitioner's appeal as
untimely because it was filed more than
thirty days after the October 18 order. See
V.R.A.P. 4(a)(1) (providing that notice of
appeal must be filed within thirty days of
<Page 787>
final judgment). Petitioner filed a motion
to reconsider with this Court, noting that
"the definitive Employment Security
Board decision for which [he] seek[s] appellate
review issued on October 27, 2023."
Based on his assertion that he was appealing
the Board's October 27 decision declining
to issue a declaratory ruling, this
Court reinstated petitioner's appeal. When
questioned regarding the order on appeal
at oral argument, petitioner confirmed that
he sought to appeal the October 27 order
declining to issue a declaratory judgment.

<P20>&para; 8. For the sake of clarity, we first
address the timeliness of petitioner's appeal.
A timely appeal is a jurisdictional
requirement, without which this Court is
powerless to consider a case. <EMU>Allen v. Vt.
Emp. Sec. Bd.</EMU>, 133 Vt. 166, 168, 333 A.2d
122, 124 (1975). ESB Rule 19 mandates
that any final decision of the Board include
a notice of appeal rights which "shall state
clearly the place and manner for filing an
appeal ... and the period within which the
appeal may be taken." The notice provided
to petitioner here with the Board's October
18 order notes that appeals taken to the
Vermont Supreme Court must be "in accordance
with Vermont Rules of Appellate
Procedure 3 and 4." It further provides
that the "notice of appeal must be RECEIVED
by the clerk of the Employment
Security Board within 30 days of the date
of entry of the board's decision" and that
"[a] notice of appeal postmarked, but not
received within 30 days, may be considered
untimely." It is undisputed that petitioner's
notice of appeal was received by the
clerk of the Employment Security Board
on November 20, 2023, thirty-three days
after the issuance of the Board's October
18 reconsideration decision, and seventy
days after the September 11 order on the
merits. Thus, we are without jurisdiction
to consider whether the Board's decision
regarding petitioner's benefits eligibility
was in error.

<P20>&para; 9. Therefore, we turn to petitioner's
appeal of the Board's decision declining
to issue a declaratory ruling. The Vermont
Administrative Procedure Act (APA)
was intended to standardize agency procedures
for a variety of administrative proceedings
including rulemaking, contested
cases, and the issuance of declaratory rulings.
See 3 V.S.A. &sect;&sect; 800-849. The APA
empowers agencies to issue declaratory
rulings, stating that "[e]ach agency shall
provide for the filing and prompt disposition
of petitions for declaratory rulings ...
and may so provide by procedure or rule."
<EMU>Id</EMU>. &sect; 808. The statute specifies that a
ruling disposing of a petition has "the
same status as agency decisions or orders
in contested cases." <EMU>Id</EMU>. Further, the APA
provides that any person "who has exhausted
all administrative remedies available
within the agency and who is aggrieved
by a final decision in any contested
case may appeal that decision to the Supreme
Court," allowing for our review. <EMU>Id</EMU>.
&sect; 815(a).

<P20>&para; 10. The ESB Rules allow "[a]ny interested
person" to petition the Board for a
declaratory ruling "as to the applicability
of any provision of 21 V.S.A. Chapter 17 or
any rule or order" of the Board. ESB Rule
1(A)(1). The rule requires that:

<B42>[t]he petition must contain sufficient
facts from which it can be determined
that a real question exists concerning
the applicability of any provision of said
law or of any rule or order of the Vermont
Employment Security Board to
the petitioner and that a declaratory
ruling by the Board would resolve the
question. The Board shall consider the
petition and within a reasonable time
shall:

<B44>(a) Issue a declaratory ruling;
<Page 788>

<B44>(b) Notify the petitioner that no declaratory
ruling is to be issued; or

<B44>(c) Set a reasonable time and place for
hearing argument upon the matter
and give reasonable notification to the
petitioner, and any other person or
persons named as a party to the proceedings,
of the time and place for
such hearing and of the issues involved.

<P00><EMU>Id</EMU>.

<P20>&para; 11. The facts here present the exact
inverse of those at issue in <EMU>In re D.A.
Associates</EMU>, where we dismissed that appeal
after determining that a "jurisdictional
defect ... attached when petitioner
sought to bypass proper appeals procedures
by seeking a &sect; 808 ruling." 150 Vt.
18, 19, 547 A.2d 1325, 1326 (1988). There,
the petitioner sought relief from certain
conditions imposed by a certificate of
compliance in constructing a condominium
development by requesting a declaratory
ruling from the Commissioner of the
Department of Water Resources and Environmental
Engineering. The Commissioner
issued a ruling upholding the conditions,
but noted that:

<B42>It would have been more appropriate
to have appealed the individual decision
informally to the Chief, Engineering
Services, or <EMU>formally</EMU> to the Water Resources
Board as provided in Sections 2-02D
and E of the Environmental Protection
Rules.

<P00><EMU>Id</EMU>. (emphasis in original). On appeal, this
Court determined that the Commissioner
"should have denied petitioner's request"
because petitioner "not only failed to exhaust
the proper remedies [in appealing
the imposition of the conditions], but no
attempt was made to invoke them at all."
<EMU>Id</EMU>. at 19-20, 547 A.2d at 1326-27. Thus, we
dismissed the appeal in holding that the
Commissioner "had no jurisdiction to issue
the ruling he did." <EMU>Id</EMU>. at 20, 547 A.2d at
1326.

<P20>&para; 12. Like the petitioner in <EMU>D.A.
Associates</EMU>, petitioner here had an available
remedy through a direct appeal to
challenge the Board's decision disqualifying
him for unemployment benefits due to
misconduct. As we have previously held,
"proceedings under various declaratory
judgment statutes cannot be substituted
for adequate and available remedies of review
... of decisions by administrative
tribunals." <EMU>In re State Aid Highway No. 1,
Peru, Vt.</EMU>, 133 Vt. 4, 8, 328 A.2d 667, 669
(1974). That is exactly what petitioner attempted
to do here, in offering to "waive
[his] right to appeal under ESB Rule 15"
and proceed by "petition[ing] the ESB for
a declaratory ruling." However, "[w]here
the Legislature specifically mandates" it,
as they have here, "exhaustion [of administrative
remedies] is required" and cannot
be waived. <EMU>Stone v. Errecart</EMU>, 165 Vt. 1, 4,
675 A.2d 1322, 1325 (1996); see 3 V.S.A.
&sect; 815(a) (allowing appeal where party has
"exhausted all administrative remedies
available within the agency"). In recognition
of this, the Board declined to issue the
declaratory ruling requested by petitioner,
noting that it had already addressed the
issue in petitioner's benefits appeal.

<P20>&para; 13. "Analogizing rulings by state
agencies under &sect; 808 to declaratory judgments
by the courts ... [,] it is the purpose
of such rulings to declare the rights
of parties in the first instance, <EMU>not</EMU> whether
rights already acted upon at the agency
level have been properly determined."
<EMU>D.A. Assocs.</EMU>, 150 Vt. at 19, 547 A.2d at
1326 (emphasis in original). Had the Board
granted the declaratory ruling requested
by petitioner, said ruling would have suffered
from the same jurisdictional flaw as
those at issue in <EMU>D.A. Associates</EMU> and <EMU>State
Aid Highway No. 1</EMU>. See <EMU>State Aid Highway
No. 1</EMU>, 133 Vt. at 9, 328 A.2d at 670
<Page 789>
("[T]he Environmental Board lacked jurisdiction
to reverse an unappealed from ruling
of the District Commission by resort to
a declaratory ruling."); <EMU>D.A. Assocs.</EMU>, 150
Vt. at 20, 547 A.2d at 1326 ("The same
problem follows the case into this Court;
we have no jurisdiction to resolve this
appeal on the merits of a ruling the Commissioner
had no power to make.").

<P20>&para; 14. The Board properly declined petitioner's
continued requests for a declaratory
ruling on the same issue as petitioner's
benefits claim. Petitioner had an available
remedy for review of the Board's order on
the merits of his claim. A motion for declaratory
judgment cannot be used as a
substitute for a timely appeal. Therefore,
we affirm the Board's order declining to
issue a declaratory ruling.

<P20><EMU>Affirmed</EMU>.

<P20>&para; 1. Developer, Allco Renewable Energy
Limited, and its affiliates, Chelsea Solar
LLC, Apple Hill Solar LLC, and PLH
Vineyard Sky LLC, appeal a permanent
injunction and civil-penalty order issued by
the Vermont Public Utility Commission
(PUC). The PUC found that by clearing
trees at the planned location of an electric-generation
facility while its petition for a
certificate of public good (CPG) was pending,
developer had initiated site preparation
without a CPG, in violation of 30
V.S.A. &sect; 248(a)(2)(A). Developer argues
that the tree clearing was intended not as
site preparation but to support its agricultural
activities, and it brings a host of
jurisdictional, administrative, and constitutional
arguments against the injunction
and civil penalty. We conclude that the
PUC had jurisdiction over developer's activities,
that it acted within its authority in
imposing the injunction and civil penalty,
and that none of developer's remaining
arguments have merit. Accordingly, we affirm
the PUC's order.

<CN>I. Background

<P20>&para; 2. In 2013 and 2014, developer executed
two standard-offer contracts under 30
V.S.A. &sect; 8005(a) for solar-electric energy
generation facilities at two sites, Willow
Road and Apple Hill Road, located on a
twenty-seven-acre parcel of land in Bennington,
Vermont. Developer subsequently
applied for the requisite CPGs by filing
petitions with the PUC for each contract,
pursuant to 30 V.S.A. &sect; 248. The standard-offer
contracts have been amended several
times to extend their operational deadlines
and have neither expired nor been relinquished.
The PUC denied a CPG for the
Willow Road site in 2016 and denied an
amended petition in 2019, which this Court
affirmed in 2021. See <EMU>In re Chelsea Solar
LLC</EMU>, 2021 VT 27, 214 Vt. 526, 254 A.3d
156. The PUC granted a CPG for the
Apple Hill Road site in 2018, but neighbors
appealed, and this Court reversed in part
and remanded for further proceedings. See
<EMU>In re Apple Hill Solar LLC</EMU>, 2019 VT 64,
211 Vt. 54, 219 A.3d 1295.

<P20>&para; 3. Following the remand, developer
filed an amended petition for a CPG for
the Apple Hill Road site to reflect developer's
intention to graze sheep and grow
hemp on the Apple Hill Road site and an
adjacent five-acre parcel, which the PUC
considered part of the Apple Hill Road
site. Developer's amended petition stated
that the agricultural activities were "wholly
unrelated to the proposed-solar [sic]
use." On May 7, 2020, the PUC denied a
CPG for the Apple Hill Road site on remand
and denied the motion to amend the
petition to reflect sheep grazing and hemp
farming at the project site.

<P20>&para; 4. In June 2020, while developer's motion
for reconsideration was pending, a
neighbor filed a public comment with the
PUC alleging that developer had begun
clearing trees on the land, despite the CPG
denial. In response, the Agency of Natural
Resources (ANR) raised concerns that the
site clearing threatened substantial and
immediate harm to "rare" and "very rare"
plants and requested a cease-and-desist
order to prevent irreparable harm to the
plants. The Department of Public Safety
(DPS) also requested further investigation
into whether developer initiated the tree-clearing
activity as site preparation for the
electric-generation facilities, in violation of
30 V.S.A. &sect; 248(a)(2). The PUC subsequently
initiated an investigation "pursuant
to 30 V.S.A. Sections 30 and 209" and
informed developer to "be prepared to address
with affidavits (filed before the hearing
begins) or live testimony whether site
clearing being conducted on Apple Hill in
Bennington, Vermont, violates Section
248(a)(2) of Title 30."
<Page 796>

<P20>&para; 5. At the subsequent evidentiary hearing,
Thomas Melone appeared on behalf of
developer and testified about the tree
clearing and proposed agricultural activities.
While Melone insisted that the tree
clearing was being done for agricultural
purposes, he stated that the "primary aspect"
of the sheep grazing would be to
clear vegetation around the solar facility,
and he agreed that it would not be possible
to build a solar facility on the site "unless
the trees are cleared." Based in part on
this testimony, the PUC concluded that
developer's "actions on Apple Hill continue
to be part of [its] plan to develop the site
for the two facilities that are the subject of
its standard-offer contracts." The PUC
therefore issued a temporary restraining
order prohibiting site-preparation activities
on both the twenty-seven-acre and
five-acre parcels. Despite the order, developer
continued to conduct site clearing
activities the following day until a sheriff
arrived and ordered all work to cease.
Developer appealed the temporary restraining
order, but we dismissed without
prejudice to refiling if a permanent injunction
was granted. See <EMU>In re Investigation
Pursuant to 30 V.S.A. &sect;&sect; 30 & 209</EMU>, No.
2020-242, 2020 WL 6799008 (Vt. Nov. 5,
2020) (unpub. mem.) [https://perma.cc/8PF3-H3DN].

<P20>&para; 6. Following a second evidentiary hearing,
the PUC concluded that developer's
tree-clearing activity was site preparation
for the proposed solar-electric-generation
facilities and thus, without a CPG, violated
30 V.S.A. &sect; 248(a)(2). The PUC found that
(1) ANR observed site-clearing activity on
the twenty-seven-acre parcel; (2) developer
planned to build two solar-electric-generation
facilities on the site; (3) clearing for a
solar facility requires tree clearing; and (4)
developer planned to use sheep as part of
its solar facility development plan. The
PUC therefore issued a permanent injunction
order in April 2021 prohibiting developer
"from engaging in any further site
preparation without a CPG, including tree
clearing, on any properties identified in its
standard-offer contracts or CPG petitions
for solar electric generation facilities,"
which included both the twenty-seven-acre
and five-acre parcels. The order would remain
in place until either "(1) the Developer
receives a CPG for constructing an
electric generation facility on this site, or
(2) final orders from the Vermont Supreme
Court or the Commission deny both of the
CPG petitions ... and both of the Developer's
standard-offer contracts have expired
or been voluntarily relinquished."
Developer again filed an appeal, which we
dismissed because it was not taken from a
final appealable order. See <EMU>In re Investigation
Pursuant to 30 V.S.A. &sect;&sect; 30 & 209</EMU>,
2021 VT 92, 216 Vt. 145, 274 A.3d 823.

<P20>&para; 7. The PUC conducted additional proceedings,
including a third evidentiary
hearing, to determine the amount of the
civil penalty under 30 V.S.A. &sect; 30. DPS
recommended a civil penalty in the amount
of $5000 while ANR recommended $29,000.
Pursuant to 30 V.S.A. &sect; 30(c), the PUC
analyzed eight factors to determine the
amount of the penalty. The PUC concluded
that developer's failure to comply with its
regulatory obligations harmed the credibility
and integrity of the process, resulting
in harm to the statutory scheme and potential
harm to public safety and welfare,
the environment, and utility customers.
The PUC also found developer's claims
that site preparation was done solely for
unrelated farming purposes to be not credible
given that developer knew that it did
not have a CPG, that it was required to
have one, that it needed to clear trees for
site preparation, and that clearing had already
been denied by the PUC. Finally,
the PUC found that developer had sufficient
resources to pay the fine and that the
$5000 penalty would have specific and general
<Page 797>
deterrent effects. While the other
statutory factors did not weigh against
developer, the PUC concluded that based
on these findings, a $5000 fine was appropriate.
This appeal followed.

<CN>II. Discussion

<P20>&para; 8. Developer makes five main arguments
on appeal. First, it contends that
the PUC lacked jurisdiction over its tree-clearing
activities because these activities
were agricultural and not "site preparation
for or construction of an electric generation
facility." 30 V.S.A. &sect; 248(a)(2)(A). Second,
developer asserts that the PUC
lacked statutory authority to initiate the
investigation, enjoin the tree-clearing activities,
and impose civil penalties. Third,
developer attacks the injunctive order on
various grounds, arguing that there was no
irreparable injury, that the order was overly
broad, and that the order was arbitrary
and capricious. Fourth, developer argues
that ANR's participation in these
proceedings and its classification of rare
and very rare plants exceeded its authority.
Finally, developer brings several constitutional
challenges to the proceedings,
arguing that &sect; 248 is unconstitutionally
vague, that the delegation of authority to
the PUC violates separation of powers,
that developer was denied due process,
and that it was denied the right to a jury
trial.

<P20>&para; 9. In reviewing decisions of the
PUC, we accord "substantial deference"
and apply "a strong presumption of validity
to the Commission's orders."<fnr1> <EMU>In re Vt.
Gas Sys., Inc.</EMU>, 2024 VT 2, &para; 15, 219 Vt.
___, 312 A.3d 519 (quotations omitted)
(alteration omitted). The PUC's findings
"will stand unless clearly erroneous," and
we will neither "reweigh conflicting evidence
nor reassess the credibility of witnesses."
<EMU>In re Acorn Energy Solar 2, LLC</EMU>,
2021 VT 3, &para; 23, 214 Vt. 73, 251 A.3d 899
(quotation omitted). However, while our
review is generally deferential, "we do not
abdicate our responsibility to examine a
disputed statute independently and ultimately
determine its meaning." <EMU>In re
Swanton Wind LLC</EMU>, 2018 VT 141, &para; 7, 209
Vt. 224, 204 A.3d 635 (quotation omitted).
In our "independent examination, we employ
our usual tools of statutory construction,"
starting with the plain language of
the statute. <EMU>Id</EMU>. In construing a statute, our
"paramount goal ... is to give effect to the
intent of the Legislature." <EMU>In re Portland
St. Solar LLC</EMU>, 2021 VT 67, &para; 13, 215 Vt.
394, 264 A.3d 872 (quotation omitted).

<CN>A. The PUC's Jurisdiction

<P20>&para; 10. Developer first argues that
the PUC lacks jurisdiction under 30 V.S.A.
&sect; 209 because its property is not subject
to the supervision of the PUC under chapter
5 of Title 30.<fnr2> Developer contends that
its tree-clearing activities were farming-related
rather than site preparation for its
proposed solar facilities and that these activities
are therefore beyond the PUC's jurisdiction.
We disagree. Section 209(a) of
Title 30 provides in relevant part that "the
[PUC] shall have jurisdiction to hear, determine,
render judgment, and make orders
<Page 798>
and decrees in all matters provided
for in the charter or articles of any corporation
owning or operating any plant, line,
or <EMU>property subject to supervision under
[chapter 5 of Title 30]</EMU>." (emphasis added).
Developer is a corporation that owns the
property at issue in this case. Because it
holds standard-offer contracts for two proposed
solar-electric-generation facilities
under 30 V.S.A. &sect; 8005 and applied for
CPGs for both proposed facilities under 30
V.S.A. &sect; 248-a provision of chapter 5 of
Title 30-developer is subject to the supervision
of the PUC under chapter 5 of
Title 30 and thus the PUC's jurisdiction
under 30 V.S.A. &sect; 209. See <EMU>In re Constr.
& Operation of a Meteorological Tower</EMU>,
2019 VT 20, &para; 21 n.6, 210 Vt. 27, 210 A.3d
1230 (holding that "[b]y erecting a tower
that required approval under &sect; 246, a provision
of Chapter 5 of Title 30, [property
owner] subjected himself to PUC jurisdiction
under [&sect; 209]").

<P20>&para; 11. To be sure, the PUC does not
have jurisdiction over pure farming activity.
See 30 V.S.A. &sect;&sect; 203, 209 (describing
general scope of PUC's jurisdiction);
<EMU>Acorn Energy Solar 2</EMU>, 2021 VT 3, &para; 114,
214 Vt. 73, 251 A.3d 899 (noting that "public
administrative bodies have only such
adjudicatory jurisdiction as is conferred on
them by statute" (quotation omitted)). But
the PUC has related jurisdiction as described
in the statute. As the PUC found
and the record reflects, developer's tree-clearing
activities were still prohibited as
"site preparation for or construction of an
electric generation facility" regardless of
whether they also had an agricultural
character. <EMU>Id</EMU>. &sect; 248(a)(2)(A). Developer
provided testimony during the initial proceedings
that "sheep and solar go together"
and that the "primary aspect" of the
sheep project would be for use in connection
with the solar project. Developer's
initial proposal indicated that clearing the
trees would be part of site preparation.
And at the temporary-injunction hearing,
developer conceded that tree clearing was
a prerequisite to building the solar projects.
Based on this evidence, the PUC
found that the sheep-farming activity
would primarily serve to control vegetative
growth for developer's proposed solar facilities
and that tree clearing was essential
to the preparation of a solar-electric-generation
site. Based on these findings, the
PUC could reasonably conclude that the
tree clearing was "site preparation for or
construction of an electric generation facility."
<EMU>Id</EMU>. Because developer subjected its
property to the PUC's supervision by applying
for a CPG under 30 V.S.A.
&sect; 248(a)(2), developer was precluded from
conducting site preparation for its proposed
solar facilities without the requisite
CPG. And based on the PUC's findings
and the plain language of the statute, we
agree that these activities constituted site
preparation.

<P20>&para; 12. Relatedly, developer argues
that its sheep-farming and hemp-growing
activities have "a separate function apart
from the electric facility" and that under
PUC precedent, these activities must be
deemed "reasonably related" to its proposed
solar facilities for the PUC to have
jurisdiction. Developer points to several
prior decisions where the PUC applied the
reasonable-relationship test to evaluate
what project components should be included
as part of an electric-generation-facility
subject to &sect; 248, and it argues that the
PUC's decision not to apply the test here
was arbitrary and capricious.<fnr3> See <EMU>In re</EMU>
<Page 799>
<EMU>Beaver Wood Energy Pownal, LLC</EMU>, Docket
No. 7678, slip op. (Vt. Pub. Util. Comm.
Apr. 1, 2011).); <EMU>In re Monument Farms
Three Gen, LLC</EMU>, Docket No. 7592, slip
op., 2010 WL 4271398 (Vt. Pub. Util.
Comm. Oct. 22, 2010); <EMU>In re Georgia Mountain
Community Wind, LLC</EMU>, Docket No.
7508, slip op. (Vt. Pub. Serv. Bd. Jan. 5,
2012). However, unlike the cited cases, the
PUC here was not evaluating whether developer's
proposed sheep-farming and
hemp-growing activities were themselves
part of the electric-generation facility; instead,
the PUC was evaluating whether
the tree-clearing activities would be considered
site preparation under &sect; 248(a)(2).
As explained above, regardless of any auxiliary
agricultural purpose, the tree clearing
was site preparation under &sect; 248(a)(2).
Developer therefore has not shown any
inconsistency with the PUC's precedents.

<P20>&para; 13. Finally, developer contends
its property can only be subject to the
PUC's supervision once the PUC has issued
a CPG. But developer's argument is
inconsistent with the plain language of
&sect; 248(a)(2), which refers to "an electric
generation facility ... that is designed for
<EMU>eventual operation</EMU>," and which prohibits
"site preparation ... unless the [PUC]
<EMU>first finds</EMU> that the [electric-generation facility]
will promote the general good of the
State and issues a certificate to that effect."
(emphases added). As we have previously
recognized, the future-oriented
language of &sect; 248(a)(2) "highlights the
Legislature's intent to bring within the
statute's purview proposed construction,
i.e., a facility that has not yet been built."
See <EMU>In re Proposed Sale of Vt. Yankee
Nuclear Power Station</EMU>, 2003 VT 53, &para; 10,
175 Vt. 368, 829 A.2d 1284. By developer's
reasoning, it could begin site preparation
for an electric-generation facility without
ever submitting a CPG application, while a
CPG application is pending, or, as was the
case here, pending reconsideration or appeal
of the denial of a CPG application.
Developer's reasoning directly contradicts
the CPG requirement provided for in
&sect; 248(a)(2) and would provide an avenue
for developer, or any standard-offer contract
holder, to circumvent the PUC's supervision
under chapter 5 of Title 30, contrary
to the plain intent of the law. We
therefore reject this argument.

<CN>B. The PUC's Authority

<P20>&para; 14. Developer next argues that
the PUC lacked authority to open its investigation
or to issue the injunction and
civil-penalty orders. We again disagree.
First, the PUC has the authority to open
an investigation into whether developer violated
30 V.S.A. &sect; 248(a)(2) pursuant to 30
V.S.A. &sect; 209(a)(6), which authorizes the
PUC to "restrain any company subject to
supervision under [chapter 5 of Title 30]
from violations of law." Developer is a
company subject to supervision under
chapter 5 of Title 30.<fnr4> To determine whether
<Page 800>
a company has violated &sect; 248(a)(2) and
thus requires restraint, the PUC has the
implied authority to investigate the matter.
While developer contends that the PUC's
power "to open investigations is limited to
express statutory authorizations," we have
long recognized that the PUC (formerly
the Public Service Commission) has "such
powers as are expressly conferred upon it
by the Legislature, together with such incidental
powers expressly granted or necessarily
implied as are necessary to the
full exercise of those granted." <EMU>Trybulski
v. Bellows Falls Hydro-Elec. Corp.</EMU>, 112 Vt.
1, 7, 20 A.2d 117, 120 (1941). We reiterate
that principle here. The plain language of
&sect; 209(a)(6) authorizing restraint from violations
of law implies the power to investigate
such violations. Without the power to
initiate an investigation, the PUC would be
unable to effectively exercise the power to
restrain violations of law by parties under
its supervision. The PUC therefore had
the authority to open an investigation into
whether developer violated 30 V.S.A.
&sect; 248(a)(2) by beginning site preparation
without the requisite CPG.

<P20>&para; 15. Developer argues that only
DPS can open an investigation into violations
of &sect; 248, citing to 30 V.S.A. &sect; 30(h),
which provides that DPS "<EMU>may</EMU> issue an
administrative citation to a person [DPS]
believes after investigation violated
[&sect; 248]." (Emphasis added.) However,
while &sect; 30(h) provides one avenue for an
enforcement action for a &sect; 248 violation,
nothing in the statute makes that authority
exclusive. See <EMU>State v. Boyajian</EMU>, 2022 VT
13, &para; 22, 216 Vt. 288, 278 A.3d 994 ("The
plain, ordinary meaning of the word `may'
indicates that [a] statute is permissive and
not mandatory." (quotation omitted) (alteration
omitted)). Moreover, by the plain
terms of the statute, the "administrative
citation" available under &sect; 30(h) is distinct
from the civil penalties available under the
statute's other provisions. For example,
&sect; 30(h) caps penalties at $5000, whereas
&sect; 30(b) permits penalties of up to $85,000,
plus ongoing fines for continued violations.
If &sect; 30(h) were the only avenue for opening
investigations, the higher penalties authorized
by &sect; 30(b) would be ineffective.
Thus, the PUC had the authority to open
the investigation under &sect; 209(a)(6) regardless
of whether DPS chose to exercise its
authority under &sect; 30(h). See <EMU>In re SolarCity
Corp.</EMU>, 2019 VT 23, &para;&para; 11, 18, 210 Vt. 51,
210 A.3d 1255 (recognizing that PUC and
DPS have overlapping powers and distinguishing
between "an administrative-citation
proceeding pursuant to &sect; 30(h)" and
"an investigation under the more general
provisions of &sect; 30").

<P20>&para; 16. Second, the PUC has the
authority to issue a permanent injunction
order pursuant to 30 V.S.A. &sect;&sect; 9 and 209.
Section 9 provides that the PUC "shall
have the powers of a court of record in
the determination and adjudication of all
matters over which it is given jurisdiction.
It may <EMU>render judgments, make orders</EMU>
and decrees, <EMU>and enforce the same</EMU> by any
suitable process issuable by courts in this
State." 30 V.S.A. &sect; 9 (emphasis added). As
explained above, the PUC has jurisdiction
over developer pursuant to &sect; 209. Therefore,
under &sect; 9, the PUC has the authority
to make factual findings, draw legal
conclusions based on an investigation into
violations of law, and take subsequent enforcement
action, including issuing an injunction
order which is a "suitable process
issuable by courts in this State." <EMU>Id</EMU>.;
V.R.C.P. 65; see also <EMU>In re Vt. Elec. Power
Producers, Inc.</EMU>, 165 Vt. 282, 293, 683
A.2d 716, 722 (1996) (noting that "the
[PUC] has all the powers of a trial court
in the determination and adjudication of
<Page 801>
matters over which it has jurisdiction").
The PUC's authority to issue an injunction
order is further supported by
&sect; 209(a)(6) which gives the PUC the power
"to <EMU>restrain</EMU>" a company "from violations
of law." (Emphasis added.) Here, the
PUC concluded from its investigation that
developer's activity was site preparation
for its proposed solar facilities and therefore
violated &sect; 248(a)(2). Consequently,
the PUC had the authority to issue a permanent
injunction to restrain developer
pursuant to &sect;&sect; 9 and 209.

<P20>&para; 17. Finally, the PUC has the
authority to issue civil penalties under 30
V.S.A. &sect; 30(a)(1), which provides in relevant
part that "[a] person, company, or
corporation subject to the supervision of
the [PUC] ... who violates a provision of
... section 231 or 248 ... shall be required
to pay a civil penalty." Here, as
discussed above, developer is a corporation
subject to the supervision of the PUC
that violated a provision of &sect; 248. The
plain language of &sect; 30(a)(1) therefore authorizes
the PUC to impose a civil penalty
and requires developer to pay that penalty
in the amount determined by the PUC
pursuant to &sect; 30(c). Section 30(c), in turn,
lays out eight factors the PUC may consider
"[i]n determining the amount of a
fine under [&sect; 30(a)]." The PUC considered
those factors in determining the amount
of the civil penalty here. It held three evidentiary
hearings, considered DPS's and
ANR's recommendations as part of its determination
of the penalty, and subsequently
issued the lower of the two recommendations-an
amount of $5000. It
therefore acted within its discretion in issuing
the penalty. See <EMU>Constr. & Operation
of a Meteorological Tower</EMU>, 2019 VT
20, &para; 10, 210 Vt. 27, 210 A.3d 1230 ("[T]he
PUC's decision to set and impose a penalty
is within its discretion and will be upheld
as long as it shows a thorough and
fair evaluation of the various relevant factors."
(quotation omitted)).

<CN>C. The Injunction Order

<P20>&para; 18. Developer next brings two claims
of error with respect to the injunctive order.
First, it argues that the irreparable-harm
requirement for injunctive relief applies
here and was not met. Developer
contends that our decision in <EMU>Town of
Sherburne v. Carpenter</EMU>, 155 Vt. 126, 582
A.2d 145 (1990), permitting public agencies
to seek injunctive relief without a showing
of irreparable harm in certain circumstances,
is inapplicable because there is
"no statute that authorizes the PUC to
issue an injunction for an alleged violation
of &sect; 248's site preparation rule." Assuming
<EMU>Town of Sherburne</EMU> does not apply, developer
argues that there was no irreparable
harm here because harm to the regulatory
process is not a recognized harm, and the
purported environmental harms are insufficient
since the trees will ultimately be
cleared either way.

<P20>&para; 19. Developer is correct that a
party seeking injunctive relief ordinarily
must prove that an injury has occurred for
which there is no adequate remedy at law.
See <EMU>In re Investigation into Gen. Ord. No.
45</EMU>, 2013 VT 24, &para; 7, 193 Vt. 676, 67 A.3d
285 (mem.). This burden is often met by
showing that the plaintiff will suffer irreparable
harm if the court does not intervene
to enjoin the challenged activity. <EMU>Id</EMU>. But in
<EMU>Town of Sherburne</EMU>, we held that

<B22>[g]enerally, where a statute authorizes a
... public agency to seek an injunction
in order to enforce compliance with a
local ordinance or state statute, and is
silent as to the injury caused, [the agency]
is not required to show irreparable
harm or the unavailability of an adequate
remedy at law before obtaining an
injunction; rather, all that must be
shown is a violation of the ordinance.
<Page 802>

<P00>155 Vt. at 129, 582 A.2d at 148; see also
Am. Jur. 2d <EMU>Injunctions</EMU> &sect; 147 (2d ed. 2024)
("Where the government is enforcing a
statute designed to protect the public interest,
it is not required to show irreparable
harm to obtain injunctive relief; the
statute's enactment constitutes Congress's
implied finding that violations will harm
the public and ought, if necessary, be restrained.")

<P20>&para; 20. We conclude that <EMU>Town of
Sherburne</EMU> is controlling here and that the
PUC was not required to make a finding of
irreparable harm. As explained above, 30
V.S.A. &sect; 209(a)(6) authorizes the PUC, a
public agency, to restrain a company under
its jurisdiction from violations of law. The
permanent-injunction order effected the
restraint here to enforce compliance with
&sect; 248(a)(2). Because &sect; 209(a)(6) remains
silent as to the injury caused, the PUC
was not required to show irreparable harm
before obtaining the injunction-only that
developer violated &sect; 248(a)(2). As explained
above, the PUC made adequate
findings to that effect. The PUC was
therefore not required to show irreparable
injury or harm before issuing a permanent
injunction order upon finding a violation of
&sect; 248(a)(2).

<P20>&para; 21. Developer further contends
that <EMU>Town of Sherburne</EMU> requires the
PUC to review and balance the equities
before issuing an injunction order. But as
<EMU>Town of Sherburne</EMU> explains, a balancing of
the equities is permitted only in very narrow
circumstances: namely (1) "where the
violation is so insubstantial that it would
be unjust and inequitable to require" injunctive
relief, and (2) where the "violation
is innocent," or unknowingly committed.
155 Vt. at 131-32, 582 A.2d at 149. Neither
of these circumstances apply here. By the
time of the temporary-injunction order, developer
had already cleared three acres of
its twenty-seven-acre parcel, and it had
plans to clear nearly the entire parcel in
the following months. And since developer
began clearing the trees following the denial
of a proposed amendment to reflect
sheep farming activities, it had knowledge
that its actions were prohibited. See <EMU>id</EMU>. at
132, 582 A.2d at 149 ("Courts have generally
found that a conscious decision to go
forward, in the face of a direction not to
from the regulatory body, outweighs factors
pointing against the issuance of a
mandatory injunction."). Furthermore, developer
continued to conduct site preparation
even after the PUC had issued a
temporary restraining order requiring developer
to halt its tree-clearing activity.
We therefore conclude developer's violation
was neither insubstantial nor innocent.
As such, no balancing of the equities was
required by the PUC here.<fnr5>

<P20>&para; 22. Second, developer argues
that the injunction order is overbroad in
that it applies not only to the physical
location of the planned energy facility, but
also to the adjacent five-acre "horticultural
use lot." While it is true that the electric-generation
facility itself will not be placed
on the horticultural-use lot, that lot is part
of developer's CPG application and is
therefore part of the overall site. In its
initial proposal, developer included a plan
to use conservation zones and trees in the
horticultural-use lot to offset environmental
and aesthetic impacts of the facility.
<Page 803>
And in its proposed amendment, developer
suggested that it would construct a building
on the horticultural use lot to obstruct
neighboring views and limit aesthetic impacts.
These environmental and aesthetic
concerns were vital to developer's CPG
application because &sect; 248(b)(5) requires
the PUC to find that the project "will not
have an undue adverse effect on aesthetics
... [or] the natural environment." Because
the horticultural-use lot was part of developer's
proposed electric-generation facility,
the PUC could conclude that site preparation
on the horticultural-use lot was still
"site preparation for ... an electric generation
facility" in violation of &sect; 248(a)(2).

<CN>D. ANR's Authority

<P20>&para; 23. Developer next challenges
ANR's participation in these proceedings
on two grounds. First, developer
argues that ANR lacked authority to participate
in the proceedings since these proceedings
were initiated under &sect; 209 rather
than &sect; 248. However, while jurisdiction
was provided by &sect; 209, this proceeding was
an enforcement action of the prohibition on
site preparation without a CPG under
&sect; 248(a)(2). Under &sect; 248(a)(4)(E), ANR is
required to "appear as a party in any
proceedings held under this subsection." It
is therefore a proceeding under &sect; 248 and
ANR was not only permitted, but required,
to participate. In participating,
ANR was required to "provide evidence
and recommendations concerning any findings
to be made under subdivision (b)(5) of
this section" and permitted to "provide
evidence and recommendations concerning
any other matters to be determined by the
Commission in such a proceeding." <EMU>Id</EMU>.
&sect; 248(a)(4)(E). Thus, by participating in
the proceedings, offering evidence about
the environmental impacts of the tree
clearing, and recommending a civil penalty,
ANR acted within the explicit scope of
its statutory authority.

<P20>&para; 24. Second, developer argues
that ANR only has express statutory authority
to classify endangered and
threatened plant species, and that its
classification of rare and very rare species
is beyond its authority. This question
has no impact on the outcome of
this case and we therefore do not address
it. As the PUC noted in its civil-penalty
order, "the validity of ANR's
classification system is of no significance
because the Commission is not basing its
penalty assessment on actual harm to
rare plants." While the PUC did consider
the rare and very rare plant classification
in its injunctive order as part of its
finding of irreparable harm, we concluded
above that no showing of irreparable
harm was required here. See <EMU>supra</EMU>,
&para; 20. Therefore, ANR's plant classification
system did not impact the outcome
of the case. Because our assessment of
this question will not affect the outcome
of the case, we decline to decide this issue.
See <EMU>In re Vt. Elec. Power Co.</EMU>, 2006
VT 69, &para; 26, 179 Vt. 370, 895 A.2d 226
(declining to address appellant's contention
that PUC applied overly narrow definition
of statutory term where appellant
failed to argue prejudice "or explain how,
if at all, a broader approach would have
changed the result"); see also <EMU>People v.
Ringland</EMU>, 2017 IL 119484, &para; 35, 417 Ill.
Dec. 816, 89 N.E.3d 735 ("Generally, a
court of review will not consider an issue
where it is not essential to the disposition
of the case or where the result will
not be affected regardless of how the issue
is decided.").

<CN>E. Constitutional Claims

<P20>&para; 25. Finally, developer raises several
constitutional challenges to the proceedings.
First, it argues that the prohibition
on site preparation in &sect; 248(a)(2) is unconstitutionally
<Page 804>
vague and standardless. Developer
contends that the phrase "site
preparation for ... an electric generation
facility" is undefined and that the statute
provides no standards for interpreting or
implementing it. Developer suggests that
this authorizes and encourages arbitrary
and discriminatory application by allowing
the PUC to make ad hoc decisions. Second,
developer argues that the Legislature
could not, consistent with the principle of
separation of powers, constitutionally
grant the PUC power to act here because
the use of an injunction "is the stuff of
what traditional courts of equity would
handle, and thus could not be delegated to
the PUC."

<P20>&para; 26. Developer's first two constitutional
arguments present facial challenges
to the validity of &sect; 248 and &sect; 209
respectively. Each argument "seeks to invalidate
the provision outright" and neither
identifies any set of facts particular to
this case "making the statute unconstitutional,
nor to a set of facts under which the
statute would be constitutional." <EMU>In re Investigation
to Rev. Avoided Costs that
Serve as Prices for Standard-Offer Program
in 2019</EMU>, 2020 Vt 103, &para; 43, 213 Vt.
542, 251 A.3d 525; see also <EMU>Vitale v. Bellows
Falls Union High Sch.</EMU>, 2023 VT 15,
&para; 3 n.1, 217 Vt. 611, 293 A.3d 309 ("In a
facial challenge, a litigant argues that
there is no set of circumstances under
which the challenged law could be valid
and seeks the invalidation of the challenged
law." (quotation omitted)). As we
have previously explained, "the Commission
lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate a facial
challenge to a statute." <EMU>In re Apple Hill
Solar LLC</EMU>, 2023 VT 57, &para; 33, 218 Vt. ___,
311 A.3d 117. Because the PUC cannot
adjudicate facial challenges, we cannot review
such claims on appeal from an order
of the PUC. "As we have insisted in the
past, [developer's] remedy is to follow the
appropriate procedures to seek a declaratory
judgment in the superior court, where
other interested persons have an opportunity
to participate in the proceedings." <EMU>Investigation
to Rev. Avoided Costs</EMU>, 2020 VT
103, &para; 44, 213 Vt. 542, 251 A.3d 525.

<P20>&para; 27. Next, developer argues that the
PUC violated due process by failing to
provide adequate notice of the prohibited
conduct and by denying developer's request
for a hearing on the "harm to the
regulatory process." On the first point,
developer again asserts that the meaning
of "site preparation" is too vague, such
that it fails to provide adequate notice of
prohibited conduct. Developer also reiterates
its argument that the PUC acted
contrary to its precedents, which it argues
require that "an improvement to property
must constitute a physical part of an electric
generation facility." On the second
point, developer suggests that harm to the
regulatory process lacks any basis in the
statute or administrative law and was
"simply made-up by the PUC." Because no
such harm is recognized, developer asserts,
a penalty based on that harm is a
violation of due process.

<P20>&para; 28. We reject developer's due-process
arguments. First, as discussed
above, we lack jurisdiction in this matter
to address developer's facial challenge that
the phrase "site preparation" is unconstitutionally
vague. We similarly reject developer's
arguments about the PUC's
precedents for the same reasons discussed
earlier. See <EMU>supra</EMU>, &para; 12. The PUC did not
hold that an improvement need not constitute
a physical part of an electric-generation
facility; rather, it held that the term
"site preparation for ... an electric generation
facility" encompassed site-preparation
activities that may also have a secondary
purpose. This does not contradict the
PUC's precedents and does not deprive
developer of due process.
<Page 805>

<P20>&para; 29. On developer's second point,
we conclude that the PUC appropriately
weighed the statutory factors under 30
V.S.A. &sect; 30(c) and set a penalty within the
reasonable bounds of the statute. Section
30(c)(1) allows the PUC to weigh "the extent
that the violation harmed or might
have harmed the public health, safety, or
welfare, the environment, the reliability of
utility service, or the other interests of
utility customers." In discussing the harms
to the statutory scheme, the PUC described
the regulatory harm as "an extension
of the harm and potential harm to (1)
public safety and welfare, (2) the environment,
and (3) utility customers." As it explained,
"[t]he &sect; 248 process aims to protect
these interests by preventing undue
adverse impacts to the resources protected
by &sect; 248." Thus, a violation of &sect; 248 has
"attendant potential to harm the natural
environment." This discussion is in line
with the PUC's obligation to analyze the
statutory factors and therefore does not
create any due-process issues. See 30
V.S.A. &sect; 30(c)(1) (requiring consideration
of "the extent that the violation harmed <EMU>or
might have harmed</EMU> ... the environment"
(emphasis added)).

<P20>&para; 30. Finally, developer argues that it is
constitutionally entitled to a jury trial on
these charges. It cites to <EMU>Tull v. United
States</EMU>, 481 U.S. 412, 107 S.Ct. 1831, 95
L.Ed.2d 365 (1987), for the proposition
that the right to a jury trial applies to "all
actions akin to those brought at common
law as those actions were understood at
the time of the Seventh Amendment's
adoption." Because this suit seeks "common-law-like
legal remedies," developer
argues it is entitled to a jury trial. In a
supplemental citation filed after argument,
developer also points to the recent U.S.
Supreme Court decision in <EMU>SEC v. Jarkesy</EMU>,
603 U.S. 109, 144 S. Ct. 2117, 219
L.Ed.2d 650 (2024).<fnr6> Developer argues that
under <EMU>Jarkesy</EMU>, when "civil penalties are
sought against a person ... said person is
entitled to a trial by jury under the Seventh
Amendment to the United States
Constitution."

<P20>&para; 31. Despite developer's intimations
to the contrary, the Seventh
Amendment is not applicable to state
courts, and <EMU>Jarkesy</EMU> is therefore nonbinding
on this Court.<fnr7> See, e.g., <EMU>Curtis v.</EMU>
<Page 806>
<EMU>Loether</EMU>, 415 U.S. 189, 192 n.6, 94 S.Ct.
1005, 39 L.Ed.2d 260 (1974); <EMU>City of Monterey
v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey,
Ltd.</EMU>, 526 U.S. 687, 719, 119 S.Ct. 1624, 143
L.Ed.2d 882 (1999); <EMU>Osborn v. Haley</EMU>, 549
U.S. 225, 252 n.17, 127 S.Ct. 881, 166
L.Ed.2d 819 (2007). Instead, in defining
the right to a jury trial in Vermont, "we
have historically looked to our own Constitution
which, like almost every other state
constitution, guarantees the right to jury
trial to the extent that it existed at common
law at the time of the adoption of the
Constitution." <EMU>State v. Irving Oil Corp.</EMU>,
2008 VT 42, &para; 5, 183 Vt. 386, 955 A.2d 1098
(quotation omitted) (alteration omitted);
see Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 12 ("That when
any issue in fact, proper for the cognizance
of a jury is joined in a court of law, the
parties have a right to trial by jury, which
ought to be held sacred.").

<P20>&para; 32. Under Vermont law,
"[c]laims traditionally tried in a court of
law to which the constitutional right [to a
jury trial] attaches are to be distinguished
... from those that are equitable in nature,
which were traditionally tried solely
before a judge and therefore fall outside
the scope of the right." <EMU>Irving Oil Corp.</EMU>,
2008 VT 42, &para; 5, 183 Vt. 386, 955 A.2d 1098
(quotation omitted). To determine whether
the jury-trial right attaches to a statutory
claim, this Court looks primarily to "the
remedy sought ... [and] whether it is
legal or equitable in nature."<fnr8> <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para;&para; 7, 18;
<EMU>Agency of Nat. Res.</EMU>, 2013 VT 46, &para; 26, 194
Vt. 87, 75 A.3d 582. Under this test, injunctive
relief "is distinctly an equitable remedy"
and therefore does not require a jury
trial. <EMU>Campbell Inns, Inc. v. Banholzer,
Turnure & Co.</EMU>, 148 Vt. 1, 8, 527 A.2d 1142,
1147 (1987) (quotation omitted).

<P20>&para; 33. In evaluating whether an action
for civil penalties is equitable in nature,
we look to the statutory factors and
assess whether the penalty primarily exists
to punish the defendant or instead
serves primarily public purposes such as
"protecting the public health and safety
and preventing unjust enrichment at the
expense of the State and the public." <EMU>Irving
Oil Corp.</EMU>, 2008 VT 42, &para; 18, 183 Vt.
386, 955 A.2d 1098. As we have explained,
civil penalties can "reimburse the government
for enforcement expenses and other
costs generated by the violation" and
"serve a remedial purpose by making non-compliance
at least as costly as compliance."
<Page 807>
State <EMU>Agency of Nat. Res. v. Riendeau</EMU>,
157 Vt. 615, 622, 603 A.2d 360, 364
(1991). Thus, in <EMU>Irving Oil Corp.</EMU>, we concluded
that civil penalties in an environmental-enforcement
action were equitable
in nature because the statutory factors and
legislative purpose evinced "a legislative
intent to assign the careful balancing of
equities ... [to] the agency traditionally
entrusted with such decisions: a judge
rather than a jury." 2008 VT 42, &para; 18, 183
Vt. 386, 955 A.2d 1098.

<P20>&para; 34. Here too, we conclude that
the civil penalties authorized by 30 V.S.A.
&sect; 30 are equitable in nature in that they
seek primarily to promote the public welfare
rather than punish violators. Cf. <EMU>In re
Citizens Utils. Co.</EMU>, 171 Vt. 447, 454, 769
A.2d 19, 26-27 (2000) (referring to &sect; 30 as a
"public remed[y]"). A comparison of the
statutory factors in 30 V.S.A. &sect; 30(c) and
10 V.S.A. &sect; 8010(b)&mdash;the statute at issue in
<EMU>Irving Oil Corp.</EMU>&mdash;confirms the equitable
nature of the civil penalties here. Of the
eight factors under &sect; 30(c), seven are effectively
identical to the factors in &sect; 8010(b).
Compare 30 V.S.A. &sect; 30(c)(1)-(5), (7), (8),
with 10 V.S.A. &sect; 8010(b)(1)-(6), (8).<fnr9> While
some of the criteria relate to the defendant's
culpability, the factors as a whole
"reflect a primary legislative concern with
protecting the public health and safety and
preventing unjust enrichment at the expense
of the State and the public." <EMU>Irving
Oil Corp.</EMU>, 2008 VT 42, &para; 18, 183 Vt. 386,
955 A.2d 1098; see 30 V.S.A. &sect; 30(c)(1), (3)
(requiring consideration of "the extent that
the violation harmed or might have
harmed the public health, safety, or welfare"
and the "economic benefit" obtained
from the violation). Because the statute
requires a "careful balancing of equities"
both to "impose such civil penalties" and to
determine "the amount of any penalty,"
the Vermont Constitution does not require
a trial by jury. <EMU>Irving Oil Corp.</EMU>, 2008 VT
42, &para; 18, 183 Vt. 386, 955 A.2d 1098; see
also <EMU>PLH Vineyard Sky LLC v. Vt. Pub.
Util. Comm'n</EMU>, Case No. 2:23-cv-154, 2024
WL 1072017, at *12 (D. Vt. Mar. 12, 2024)
(rejecting developer's jury trial claim in
parallel federal court proceeding).

<CN>III. Conclusion

<P20>&para; 35. For the reasons discussed above,
we reject developer's challenges to the
PUC's injunction and civil-penalty orders.
The PUC had jurisdiction under &sect; 209
because developer submitted itself to PUC
supervision by applying for a CPG while
holding two standard-offer contracts. Developer
was therefore prohibited under
&sect; 248(a)(2) from engaging in site preparation
for its electric-generation facilities-a
prohibition that included the clearing of
trees. The PUC was within its authority to
initiate an investigation based on the credible
allegations of site preparation, and
based on its findings, was permitted to
issue the injunctive and civil-penalty orders.

<P20><EMU>Affirmed</EMU>.
<FN>
<fnt1> As discussed below, see <EMU>infra</EMU>, &para; 30 n.6,
nothing in our decision today implicates deference
to an agency's "permissible construction"
of an ambiguous statute. See <EMU>Chevron,
U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc.</EMU>,
467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d
694 (1984). We therefore need not decide the
impact on our jurisprudence of the U.S. Supreme
Court's recent decision abrogating
<EMU>Chevron</EMU> deference. See <EMU>Loper Bright Enters.
v. Raimondo</EMU>, 603 U.S. 369, 144 S. Ct. 2244,
219 L.Ed.2d 832 (2024).

<fnt2> Developer also argues that the PUC lacks
jurisdiction under &sect; 203. Because we decide
that the PUC had jurisdiction under &sect; 209, we
need not decide this question.

<fnt3> Developer also cites to our decision in <EMU>Mollica
v. Division of Property Valuation & Review</EMU>,
2008 VT 60, 184 Vt. 83, 955 A.2d 1171,
to support its argument that "a use that has a
separate function apart from the electric facility
is not site preparation for an electric generation
facility." In <EMU>Mollica</EMU>, we concluded
that the occasional off-season use of a building
as a rental property, where it retained its
predominant use as a "Christmas Cottage"
for a Christmas tree farm, did not constitute
the "subsequent commencement" of a nonfarming
use for purposes of taxation. <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 17
(quoting 32 V.S.A. &sect; 3752). Contrary to developer's
argument, <EMU>Mollica</EMU> does not stand for a
broad proposition that any farming use of a
property supersedes any nonfarming use of
the property. Instead, we were simply interpreting
the specific language of 32 V.S.A.
&sect; 3752 to determine whether "subsequent
commencement" required complete, or only
partial abandonment of the farming use. The
case therefore has no relevance here.

<fnt4> Section 201 of Title 30 defines "company"
to mean "individuals, partnerships, associations,
corporations, and municipalities owning
or conducting any public service business
or property used in connection therewith and
covered by the provisions of [Chapter 5]."
Because developer is a corporation owning
property covered by &sect; 209, a provision of
chapter 5, it qualifies as a company under
&sect; 201.

<fnt5> In its permanent injunction order, the PUC
concluded in the alternative that irreparable
injury existed by way of harm to rare and very
rare plants, harm to the trees that would be
cleared, and harm to the regulatory process
through the violation of &sect; 248(a)(2). Because
we hold that the PUC is not required to show
irreparable harm when seeking an injunction
to enforce compliance with &sect; 248(a)(2), we
need not decide whether it correctly concluded
that irreparable injury existed here.

<fnt6> Developer also directs us to the U.S. Supreme
Court's recent decision in <EMU>Loper
Bright</EMU>, 603 U.S. at 369, 144 S. Ct. at 2244,
overruling in part <EMU>Chevron</EMU>, 467 U.S. 837, 104
S.Ct. 2778. Developer argues that, like federal
courts, "this Court too defers to agencies,"
and it asks that we overrule our precedents
requiring agency deference. However, <EMU>Loper
Bright</EMU> dealt only with "<EMU>Chevron</EMU> deference"&mdash;
that is, deference to an agency's "permissible
construction" of a statute that is "silent or
ambiguous" as to the issue at hand. See <EMU>Loper
Bright</EMU>, 603 U.S. at 396-97, 144 S. Ct. at
2264; <EMU>Chevron</EMU>, 467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct.
2778. Nothing in our decision today implicates
the deference to an agency's legal interpretations
of an ambiguous statute called for
in <EMU>Chevron</EMU>. Rather, our decision rests on our
independent examination of the statutory text
and legislative purpose. We therefore need
not decide whether to follow <EMU>Loper Bright</EMU> at
this time. See <EMU>supra</EMU>, &para; 9 n.1.

<fnt7> However, even if it were binding, <EMU>Jarkesy</EMU> is
easily distinguishable based on the nature of
the statutory claim. The <EMU>Jarkesy</EMU> Court concluded
that "[t]he SEC's antifraud provisions
replicate common law fraud, and it is well
established that common law claims must be
heard by a jury." <EMU>Jarkesy</EMU>, 603 U.S. at 119-20,
144 S. Ct. at 2127. This common-law antecedent
was critical to the Court's conclusion that
the "public rights" exception to the Seventh
Amendment was inapplicable. <EMU>Id</EMU>. at 136-37,
144 S.Ct. at 2137 (distinguishing from <EMU>Atlas
Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety & Health
Review Commission</EMU>, 430 U.S. 442, 97 S.Ct.
1261, 51 L.Ed.2d 464 (1977), on the basis that
the statute there "did not borrow its cause of
action from the common law"). Here though,
developer fails to identify, and we are unaware
of, any common-law antecedent to the
prohibition in &sect; 248 on site preparation for an
electric-generation facility without a CPG. Developer
notes only that this case involves
"common-law-like legal remedies." But under
<EMU>Tull</EMU> and <EMU>Jarkesy</EMU>, the inquiry starts with the
"cause of action," not the remedy. <EMU>Id</EMU>. at 122-24,
144 S.Ct. at 2129; see <EMU>Tull</EMU>, 481 U.S. at
417, 107 S.Ct. 1831 (setting forth two-part
test beginning with comparison of "the statutory
action to 18th-century actions brought in
the courts of England prior to the merger of
the courts of law and equity"). Thus, as the
<EMU>Jarkesy</EMU> Court noted, "Congress could assign
... [certain statutory] adjudications to an
agency because <EMU>the claims</EMU> were `unknown to
the common law.'" <EMU>Jarkesy</EMU>, 603 U.S. at 137-39,
144 S. Ct. at 2138 (quoting <EMU>Atlas Roofing</EMU>,
430 U.S. at 461, 97 S.Ct. 1261) (emphasis
added).

<fnt8> In <EMU>Irving Oil Corp.</EMU>, we identified the two-part
test from <EMU>Tull</EMU>, which, in addition to
examining the nature of the remedy sought,
required an examination of the "closest eighteenth-century
analogue to the statutory cause
of action." 2008 VT 42, &para; 7, 183 Vt. 386, 955
A.2d 1098. However, we noted that the nature
of the remedy is "more important" to the
analysis, and quoted several concurring and
dissenting U.S. Supreme Court opinions that
"have called for dispensing altogether with
the abstruse search for what often prove to be
elusive and imprecise historical analogues."
<EMU>Id</EMU>. (quotation omitted). In our subsequent
analysis of the civil penalties, we relied solely
on the nature of the remedy and stated that
"we do not find <EMU>Tull</EMU> persuasive." <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para;&para; 17-18.
We have since characterized our test from
<EMU>Irving Oil Corp.</EMU> as "looking beyond traditional
analysis of whether [the] claim had [an]
eighteenth century common law analogue"
and instead focusing on whether the "penalty
was equitable in nature." <EMU>Agency of Nat. Res.
v. Persons</EMU>, 2013 VT 46, &para; 26, 194 Vt. 87, 75

<P20>&para; 1. Applicant Daniel Pomerantz appeals
the Cannabis Control Board's denial of his
request to waive application and licensing
fees for his proposed commercial cannabis
cultivation establishment. Applicant asserted
that he qualified as a "social equity
applicant" because he had been incarcerated
for a cannabis-related offense and came
from a community that was historically
disproportionately impacted by cannabis
prohibition. The Board determined that he
did not qualify as a social equity applicant
under its rule and denied his request for a
fee waiver. We affirm.

<P20>&para; 2. The Cannabis Control Board was
created by the Legislature in 2020 to regulate
legal access to cannabis in Vermont. 7
V.S.A. &sect; 843; 2019, No. 164 (Adj. Sess.),
&sect; 2. The Board issues licenses to cannabis
cultivators, wholesalers, retailers, manufacturers,
and testing laboratories to engage
in commercial cannabis activity. 7
V.S.A. &sect; 843(b) (setting forth duties of
Board, which include administration of licensing
program for "cannabis establishments");
<EMU>id</EMU>. &sect; 861(8) (defining cannabis
establishments). Under the current licensing
system, outdoor cultivators are categorized
into different tiers ranging from Tier
1, which includes cultivators with up to
1000 square feet of plant canopy or fewer
than 125 cannabis plants, to Tier 5, which
includes cultivators with up to 20,000
square feet of plant canopy. 7 V.S.A.
&sect; 910(1)(A).<fnr1> The Legislature has established
<Page 810>
annual licensing fees to be paid by
cultivators, which range from $750 per
year for Tier 1 cultivators to $18,000 per
year for Tier 5 cultivators. <EMU>Id</EMU>. In addition,
every applicant for a cannabis establishment
license must pay an initial one-time
application fee of $1000. <EMU>Id</EMU>. &sect; 910(11)(A).

<P20>&para; 3. Applicants who qualify as "social
equity applicants" may be entitled to a
reduction in fees. See 7 V.S.A. &sect; 911 (empowering
Board to reduce or waive application
and licensing fees for social equity
applicants); Cannabis Control Bd. Rules,
Rule 1.2.2, Code of Vt. Rules 25 000 001
[hereinafter CCB Rules], https://ccb.vermont.gov/sites/ccb/files/2023-10/CCBRule1Licensing.pdf
[https://perma.cc/3BCQ-YU46]
(requiring applicants to pay
fees in accordance with current schedule,
which includes waivers and reductions for
social equity applicants). The Board will
waive the application and license fees for
the first year that a qualified social equity
applicant is licensed. The applicant will be
required to pay 25% of the license fee in
their second year, 50% in their third year,
75% in their fourth year, and the full license
fee in subsequent years. Cannabis
Control Bd., Guidance on Application and
Licensing Fees at 6 (April 2024), https://ccb.vermont.gov/sites/ccb/files/2024-04/Fee.Schedule.Guidance_FINAL_4.17.24.pdf
[https://perma.cc/SK7K-TD2K]. Social equity
applicants are also eligible for low-interest
loans and other assistance from
the Cannabis Business Development Fund.
7 V.S.A. &sect; 987(c).

<P20>&para; 4. Under the Board's rules, social equity
applicants can be either individuals or
businesses. CCB Rule 1.1.3(m). Applicant
claims to qualify as a social equity individual
applicant. At the time he applied, CCB
Rule 1.1.3 defined a social equity individual
applicant to mean an individual who is a
Vermont resident and is "a socially disadvantaged
individual" or has "been incarcerated
for a cannabis-related offense."<fnr2> As
relevant here, "socially disadvantaged individuals"
meant persons who "are (<EM>l</EM>) from
a community that has historically been disproportionately
impacted by cannabis prohibition
and (2) able to demonstrate to the
Board that they were personally harmed
by the disproportionate impact." The rule
stated that "[i]n assessing this personal
harm, the Board may consider factors such
as educational impacts, lost employment
opportunities, or housing insecurity."<fnr3>

<P20>&para; 5. Applicant is the sole member of
Rebel East, LLC. In early 2022, applicant
applied on behalf of Rebel East for a Tier
5 cultivation license, the largest available.
Applicant initially asserted that he qualified
as a social equity individual applicant
because he had been incarcerated for a
cannabis-related offense. He provided documentation
that in 2012, he was charged
by the State of Nevada with one count of
conspiracy to violate the Nevada Uniform
Controlled Substances Act, a felony, and
was held for one day in county jail before
being released on bail.

<P20>&para; 6. The Board considered applicant's
request for social equity status at its June
22, 2022 meeting. The Board concluded
<Page 811>
that applicant was not eligible for social
equity status due to his Nevada conviction
because he was not sentenced to a term in
prison as the penalty for a cannabis-related
offense. Instead, his sentencing was
deferred and his case was eventually dismissed
after he successfully completed a
required term of supervision. The Board
explained that it did not consider pretrial
detention to be incarceration for a cannabis-related
offense.

<P20>&para; 7. After receiving the Board's decision,
applicant responded that he believed he
alternatively qualified for social equity status
as a socially disadvantaged individual
because he lived in Humboldt County, California
from 2010 to 2019, which he alleged
is an area that was disproportionately affected
by cannabis prohibition. He argued
that he had suffered from helicopters flying
low over him, neighbors being raided
at gunpoint and arrested, intimidation by
law enforcement on local roads, and housing
shortages and inflated housing prices
due to the illicit cannabis market. The
Board permitted applicant to amend his
application to pursue this theory. He provided
multiple written statements and was
interviewed twice by Board staff.

<P20>&para; 8. On July 15, 2022, the Board denied
applicant's request for social equity status.
It explained that applicant's time living in
Humboldt County did not automatically
qualify him as being part of a historically
impacted community under CCB Rule
1.1.3 because residing in a specific geographic
area was not, by itself, indicative
of negative impacts on individual outcomes.
It further found that applicant did
not sufficiently demonstrate that he suffered
personal harm from living in Humboldt
County, noting that he did not claim
to have been raided or arrested or to have
been the victim of violent crime. It acknowledged
applicant's statements that his
friends and neighbors experienced such
incidents and that his family suffered several
"near break-ins." However, it found
that despite such challenges, applicant was
able to relocate between the east and west
coasts several times, to acquire properties
in California and Vermont, and to start
and run his own cannabis business. It concluded
that the totality of the circumstances
did not demonstrate the type of
long-term personal harm that the fee waiver
program was meant to redress.

<P20>&para; 9. Applicant appealed to an appellate
officer. After a hearing at which the parties
presented oral arguments, the appellate
officer issued a written decision affirming
the Board's denial of applicant's
request for social equity status. This appeal
followed.

<P20>&para; 10. Applicant argues that the appellate
officer erred in declining to consider the
issues raised in applicant's statement of
questions and applied the wrong version of
the CCB Rules to his appeal. He contends
that the Board's interpretation of the term
"incarcerated" is arbitrary and that his
day in jail qualifies him as a person who
was incarcerated for a cannabis-related offense.
He further argues that the Board
erred in concluding that he was not from a
community that was historically disproportionately
impacted by cannabis prohibition.

<P20>&para; 11. We need not address applicant's
arguments concerning the appellate
officer because in this type of appeal, we
are tasked with conducting an independent
review of the Board's decision and are not
required to give any deference to the appellate
officer's conclusions. "Where there
is an intermediate level of appeal from an
administrative body, we review the case
under the same standard as applied in the
intermediate appeal." <EMU>Tarrant v. Dep't of
Taxes</EMU>, 169 Vt. 189, 195, 733 A.2d 733, 738
(1999). Here, that means that we "review
the matter on the basis of the records
created before the Board" and are precluded
<Page 812>
from "substitut[ing] [our] judgment for
that of the Board as to the weight of the
evidence on questions of fact." 7 V.S.A.
&sect; 847(b)-(c). We may reverse and remand
only if we determine that

<B22>substantial rights of the appellant have
been prejudiced because the Board's
finding, inferences, conclusions, or decisions
are:

<B22>(1) in violation of constitutional or statutory
provisions;

<B22>(2) in excess of the statutory authority of
the Board;

<B22>(3) made upon unlawful procedure;

<B22>(4) affected by other error of law;

<B22>(5) clearly erroneous in view of the evidence
on the record as a whole;

<B22>(6) arbitrary or capricious; or

<B22>(7) characterized by abuse of discretion
or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.

<P00><EMU>Id</EMU>. &sect; 847(b). Because the appellate officer
"did not take evidence but functioned solely
as an appellate body in this context," we
independently review the Board's decision
without giving deference to the appellate
officer's conclusions. <EMU>In re Town of Sherburne</EMU>,
154 Vt. 596, 603, 581 A.2d 274, 278
(1990); see <EMU>In re Bombardier</EMU>, 2018 VT 11,
&para; 15, 206 Vt. 450, 182 A.3d 1165 (reviewing
decision of appellate officer affirming
Board of Professional Engineering decision
using same standard as appellate officer).

<P20>&para; 12. We therefore turn to the primary
issue on appeal, that is, whether the Board
erred in concluding that applicant did not
qualify as a social equity individual applicant.
As noted above, applicant first argued
that he was eligible for social equity
status due to his pretrial detention in Nevada.
The Board determined that he was
not "incarcerated" within the meaning of
CCB Rule 1.1.3 because he did not serve a
prison sentence imposed as penalty for a
cannabis conviction. Applicant claims that
the Board's interpretation of the term "incarcerated"
is arbitrary and contrary to its
plain meaning, which applicant argues is
"any period of confinement."

<P20>&para; 13. Our primary goal in construing
a regulation is to determine the
intent of the administrative agency. <EMU>In re
Verburg</EMU>, 159 Vt. 161, 164, 616 A.2d 237,
239 (1992). An agency's interpretation of
its own regulation is presumed to be valid.
<EMU>Id</EMU>. at 165, 616 A.2d at 239. However, we
will not uphold an agency's interpretation
that exceeds the agency's statutory authority,
conflicts with the agency's prior interpretations
of the same rule, "results in
unjust, unreasonable or absurd consequences,"
or "demonstrates compelling indications
of error." <EMU>In re Conservation L.
Found.</EMU>, 2018 VT 42, &para; 16, 207 Vt. 309, 188
A.3d 667 (quotations omitted).

<P20>&para; 14. At the time relevant here,
CCB Rule 1.1.3(<EM>o</EM>) defined a social equity
individual applicant to mean a person who
has "been incarcerated for a cannabis-related
offense." While this language could
arguably apply to any period of confinement
connected to a cannabis-related
crime, the Board has interpreted its rule
more narrowly to require proof that the
person was sentenced to a term in prison
as the penalty for a cannabis-related conviction.
The Board's interpretation is consistent
with the policy behind the social-equity
program, which is to prioritize licensing
and provide additional business
development resources for individuals from
socioeconomic groups that have experienced
the most negative and lasting impacts
of cannabis criminalization.<fnr4> 7 V.S.A.
<Page 813>
&sect; 911; see also <EMU>id</EMU>. &sect; 903(a)(2) (requiring
Board to consider certain criteria when
issuing licenses including "whether the applicants
would foster social justice and equity
in the cannabis industry by being a
minority or women-owned business"). As a
practical matter, it also simplifies the
Board's verification process, because a judicially
imposed sentence for a cannabis-related
offense can be proven in most
cases with readily available formal documentation.
The Board's interpretation of
the term "incarcerated" does not attempt
to usurp authority not provided to the
Board or conflict with the Board's prior
interpretations of the rule, and it is not
clearly unreasonable or erroneous. We accordingly
decline to disturb it. See <EMU>Conservation
L. Found.</EMU>, 2018 VT 42, &para; 17, 207 Vt.
309, 188 A.3d 667 (explaining that where
agency rule could be reasonable interpreted
more than one way, "our substantial
deference to the [agency's] reading of its
own promulgated rule breaks the tie").

<P20>&para; 15. We acknowledge that this Court
has used the term "incarceration" to mean
pretrial detention in other situations. See,
e.g., <EMU>State v. Blackmer</EMU>, 160 Vt. 451, 458,
631 A.2d 1134, 1139 (1993) (explaining "in
cases where the constitutional right [to
bail] does not apply, the presumption is
switched so that the norm is incarceration
and not release"). However, those cases
involve individual challenges to pretrial detention
imposed by the trial court in criminal
matters; they have no bearing on licensing
requirements for cannabis farms.
We therefore do not view them as requiring
an identical meaning for the term as it
appears in the Board's rule. In fact, we
have specifically recognized that the term
"incarcerated" may have different meanings
in different settings. See <EMU>State v. Gauthier</EMU>,
2020 VT 66, &para; 17, 213 Vt. 82, 238
A.3d 675 (explaining that "the meaning of
`incarcerated' in the context of the Sex
Offender Registration Act is not necessarily
the same as in Title 28" because former
deals with where offender lives and latter
focuses on legal status of offender); see
also <EMU>State v. Powers</EMU>, 2016 VT 110, &para; 16,
203 Vt. 388, 157 A.3d 39 (noting that "the
term `in custody' has different meanings in
different contexts").<fnr5>

<P20>&para; 16. Here, it is undisputed that applicant
was not sentenced to a term in prison
for a cannabis-related offense. At the time
of his arrest, he was detained for one day
before posting bail. He later pled guilty to
a drug conspiracy charge and the court
ordered his sentencing to be deferred for
one-to-three years, subject to conditions
requiring him to attend a treatment program
and attend diversion court. The court
ordered that he would receive one day of
credit for the day he spent in jail toward
his term of probation on the deferred sentence.
In 2013, he successfully completed
probation, his case was dismissed without
sentencing, and his conviction was set
aside. Based on these facts, it was not
improper for the Board to determine that
<Page 814>
applicant was ineligible for social equity
individual applicant status due to past incarceration.

<P20>&para; 17. We turn to the other basis asserted
by applicant for eligibility: his ten-year
residency in Humboldt County, California.
As noted above, under the rule in effect
when applicant filed his application, a person
could qualify for social equity status if
they were "(1) from a community that has
historically been disproportionately impacted
by cannabis prohibition and (2) able
to demonstrate to the Board that they
were personally harmed by the disproportionate
impact." Applicant argues that the
Board improperly denied him social equity
status for not being "from" California and
that this violated his constitutional right to
travel as well as the dormant Commerce
Clause of the U.S. Constitution.<fnr6>

<P20>&para; 18. The premise of applicant's
argument is not supported by the record.
In its July 15, 2022 decision, the Board
accepted that applicant was "from" Humboldt
County in the sense that he had been
domiciled there. However, it concluded
that living in a particular geographic location
for a period of time did not necessarily
make him part of a community that had
historically been disproportionately impacted
by cannabis prohibition. As with
the term "incarcerated," the Board appears
to have interpreted the term "community"
to mean a group of people who
share a common characteristic, rather than
simply a geographic area. See <EMU>Community</EMU>,
Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary,
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community
[https://perma.cc/ZQ4S-AGF8]
(defining community to mean "a
unified body of individuals," such as "the
people with common interests living in a
particular area" or "a group of people with
a common characteristic or interest living
together within a larger society"). Applicant
does not directly challenge the
Board's interpretation of this term, which
is reasonable in light of the policy goals
discussed above.

<P20>&para; 19. Even assuming that applicant
was from a disproportionately harmed
community, however, his claim fails because
the Board concluded that he did not
demonstrate that he was personally
harmed by the disproportionate impact.
CCB Rule 1.1.3 provided that "[i]n assessing
this personal harm, the Board may
consider factors such as educational impacts,
lost employment opportunities, or
housing insecurity." The Board considered
the evidence presented by applicant and
determined that applicant failed to demonstrate
continuing disadvantages caused by
his time living in Humboldt County. It
acknowledged the stress and anxiety applicant
experienced due to fear of crime and
law enforcement activities and high housing
prices. However, it concluded that applicant
had enjoyed significant personal
and professional advancement while living
in California, ultimately acquiring multiple
properties there and in Vermont and starting
a successful cannabis business. These
findings are supported by the record and
in turn support the Board's conclusion that
applicant did not qualify for social equity
status as a socially disadvantaged individual.
We therefore see no reason to disturb
its decision. See <EMU>Vt. State Colls. Fac. Fed'n
v. Vt. State Colls.</EMU>, 151 Vt. 457, 460, 561
A.2d 417, 419-20 (1989) ("[D]ecisions made
<Page 815>
within the expertise of an administrative
agency are presumed to be correct, valid
and reasonable, and we will normally defer
to its determinations." (citation omitted));
7 V.S.A. &sect; 847(b) (prohibiting appellate
court from reweighing evidence on appeal).

<P20><EMU>Affirmed</EMU>.
<FN>
<fnt1> The statute authorizes a sixth tier, which is
to be assessed an annual licensing fee of
$34,000 per year; however, the Board apparently
has not opened that tier.

<fnt2> A person could also qualify as a social equity
individual applicant if a family member
was incarcerated for a cannabis-related offense.
This provision is not relevant here.

<fnt3> Rule 1.1.3 was subsequently amended to
define a social equity individual applicant to
mean a person who has "been incarcerated in
a jail or prison facility subsequent to sentencing
for a cannabis-related offense" and to
clarify the meaning of "community." See
CCB Rule 1.1.3(n)(ii); CCB Rule 1.1.3(p)(ii).
The parties agree that the prior version of the
rule applies to applicant's application.

<fnt4> As explained in a cannabis-law treatise, "individuals
with cannabis arrests and or convictions
have no doubt been impacted by cannabis
enforcement. However, allowing anyone
with a cannabis arrest or conviction to participate
may not adequately account for privileges
associated with race or wealth. Participation
based on prior cannabis arrests or
convictions alone could result in an overly
broad categorization, allowing for the unintended
inclusion of individuals from communities
that were not disproportionately impacted
by the War on Drugs." C. Packer,
Cannabis Law Deskbook &sect; 7:9 (2023-2024
ed.).

<fnt5> Appellant argues that in <EMU>Gauthier</EMU>, we
adopted the common dictionary definition of
incarceration, which is "confinement in a
prison," when construing the term as it appeared
in a statute. 2020 VT 66, &para; 8, 213 Vt.
82, 238 A.3d 675. <EMU>Gauthier</EMU> is distinguishable
because we are not here conducting a de novo
interpretation of a statute, but rather examining
whether the agency's interpretation of its
own rule is clearly erroneous or unreasonable.

<fnt6> Applicant argues that in ruling that he was
not "from" California, the Board improperly
relied on a version of CCB Rule 1.1.3 that had
been proposed but not promulgated. He
points to statements made by Board counsel
in a memorandum dated March 2023, months
after the Board rejected his application. The
Board did not incorporate or cite to these
statements in its July 2022 decision, which is
the relevant decision on appeal. We therefore
see no evidence that the Board applied the
wrong version of the rule.

<P20>&para; 1. Defendant appeals his conviction for
cruelty to a child following a jury trial. On
appeal, defendant argues that it was plain
error for the court to allow admission of
defendant's prior conviction for cruelty to
a child involving a different victim. We
conclude that admission of defendant's prior
conviction to demonstrate defendant's
intent did not result in plain error and
affirm.

<P20>&para; 2. The following facts were presented
at trial. The charge against defendant concerned
one-year-old O.S., who lived with
his mother&mdash;defendant's girlfriend at the
time&mdash;and defendant in defendant's house
in 2019. When O.S. and his mother moved
into defendant's home, O.S. was current in
his healthcare appointments and his pediatrician
had no concerns regarding O.S.'s
health or safety. After O.S.'s mother obtained
employment, defendant provided
daily care for O.S. During this time, O.S.'s
mother observed that defendant was stern
with O.S. and O.S. often sought defendant's
approval before acting. In October
2019, O.S. started exhibiting symptoms of
a stomach bug. On Saturday, October 12,
2019, O.S. visited his father who noticed
that O.S. was unusually sleepy and fussy,
and seemed uncomfortable. When mother
retrieved O.S., she observed that O.S. was
still tired and throwing up. On Wednesday,
<Page 817>
mother brought O.S. to the doctor because
he was still vomiting. The diagnosis at the
time was a possible stomach bug. When
things did not improve by Saturday, O.S.'s
doctor advised going to the hospital.

<P20>&para; 3. Evaluations of O.S. could not determine
the cause of his symptoms, and eventually,
O.S. was examined at Dartmouth-Hitchcock
Medical Center (DHMC) where
he underwent additional testing. The treatment
team was unable to find any infection
causing O.S.'s symptoms and his case was
given to the Child Advocacy and Protection
Program (CAPP), which provides specialized
medical services for victims of
child abuse and neglect. Mother notified
the CAPP team that there were four episodes
in which O.S. woke up from his
night's sleep with a bruised ear. A doctor
explained that ear bruising is an "abuse-specific
finding," and the injury could not
be caused by a toddler putting an ear
against a wooden slat of a crib.

<P20>&para; 4. O.S. underwent a child physical-abuse
workup, including a skeletal survey
that included multiple views of O.S.'s entire
skeleton to allow doctors to determine
injuries to his bones. The results indicated
that O.S. did not have any disorders that
could account for his injuries. The survey
showed six fractures. There were three rib
fractures on the left side of the lateral
aspect of the rib cage. These injuries
showed some indication of healing. There
was also a healing fracture on the left side
of a bone in the shoulder blade. Both the
left and right humerus bones in the upper
arms had fractures in the growth plate. A
doctor explained that the lateral rib fractures
were consistent with an adult
squeezing the rib cage from front to back.
The doctor stated that the injuries to the
humerus bones were caused by vigorous or
violent pulling, shaking, or twisting of the
upper arm. The injuries required a violent
force over a short period of time. For the
injury to the shoulder blade, the doctor
explained that the mechanism of injury
would be a direct impact pulling the arm.
The doctor could not confirm whether the
injuries all occurred at the same time. She
stated that the injuries would have caused
O.S. immediate pain and further pain when
touched, pressured, or manipulated. The
doctor also explained O.S.'s ear bruising
indicated an impact to the side of the head.

<P20>&para; 5. After learning of O.S.'s injuries
mother remembered prior incidents between
defendant and O.S. Mother recalled
that shortly before O.S. became sick, she
returned from work and noticed O.S. had a
bruised ear. Defendant told mother O.S.
woke up from his nap with the injury and
speculated that the injury must have occurred
from O.S. banging his head against
the side of the bed. Mother also recounted
that she had heard O.S. crying after defendant
put him down for a nap and had
found O.S. swaddled tightly with the blanket
over his face. She removed the blanket
and unwrapped him. She also observed
defendant putting O.S. down "rather
roughly." A week before O.S. went to
DHMC, mother recalled defendant gave
O.S. a shower and afterwards defendant
made a derogatory statement about O.S. to
mother. O.S. was crying and it appeared
defendant felt bad about something. At the
time the incidents occurred, mother did
not consider them suspicious, but she
viewed them differently following the results
of the skeletal survey.

<P20>&para; 6. After O.S. was released from the
hospital, mother engaged in a conversation
with defendant on social media, asking defendant
to be honest about what defendant
did to O.S. In the conversation, defendant
indicated that O.S. might have been injured
in the shower when O.S. threw himself
back and defendant had to grab him.
He stated that he did not think he grabbed
harder than he should have.
<Page 818>

<P20>&para; 7. In January 2020, the State charged
defendant with willfully ill-treating or neglecting
a child in a manner to cause unnecessary
suffering in violation of 13
V.S.A. &sect; 1304(b)(1). Prior to trial, in July
2021, the State gave notice pursuant to
Vermont Rule of Evidence 404 that it intended
to introduce evidence of two prior
bad acts by defendant. The first incident
involved allegations from 2009 that defendant
inflicted bilateral head fractures and
a bite mark on a six-month-old child in
New Hampshire. The treating physicians
concluded that the injuries were consistent
with child abuse or nonaccidental trauma.
The second incident involved allegations
that defendant caused a bruised face,
bruised belly, bruised buttocks, and black
eyes to a four-year-old child in Vermont in
2012. At the time, defendant was in a
relationship with the child's mother. Defendant
was charged for the 2012 conduct,
and following a jury trial, defendant was
convicted of one count of domestic assault
and cruelty to a child for some of the
injuries the child received. The State asserted
that the two incidents were relevant
and admissible to demonstrate that defendant
acted willfully and not by mistake or
accident. Defendant objected to admission
of the 2009 uncharged conduct, asserting
that the State could not introduce any acts
for which there was no conviction to demonstrate
intent. Defendant's opposition did
not address the 2012 conduct that resulted
in a criminal conviction.

<P20>&para; 8. Following a hearing, the court issued
a written order. The court concluded
that the prior-bad-act evidence was relevant
and admissible for proving motive or
intent rather than showing defendant's
propensity for abuse under Rule 404(b).
The court then assessed whether the probative
value was substantially outweighed
by unfair prejudice under Vermont Rule of
Evidence 403. As to the 2009 allegation,
the court concluded that these acts were
not admissible under a Rule 403 balancing.
The court explained that evidence of those
acts would require a trial within a trial
because there was no conviction or admission
that defendant was responsible for the
child's injuries. The court determined that
this unfair prejudice outweighed the relevance
of the evidence. As to the 2012 conviction,
the court found that the prejudicial
effect did not substantially outweigh the
probative value of the evidence given that
there was a conviction and therefore less
time would be required to introduce the
evidence and that admission of just one
prior bad act would reduce the likelihood
that the jury would improperly use it as
propensity evidence. The court noted that
it would instruct the jury at the time of
admission on the limited purpose of the
evidence.

<P20>&para; 9. The case proceeded to trial, which
took place over four days. At trial, mother
testified that she did not engage in any
act, accidental or otherwise, against her
son that could cause his injuries. She also
testified concerning the conversation that
she had with defendant over social media
in which she asked defendant if he
grabbed O.S. harder than he should have
and defendant answered he could have.
Other adults in O.S.'s life also testified that
they had not harmed O.S. intentionally or
unintentionally. The State introduced testimony
from medical experts regarding
O.S.'s injuries and the causes.

<P20>&para; 10. The State also introduced evidence
of defendant's prior conviction for cruelty
to a child consistent with the trial court's
pretrial order. A former Brattleboro police
officer testified that he was involved in
investigating defendant in 2012 for harm
caused to the child of defendant's then
girlfriend. The child in question was four
years old and sustained a black eye. At the
time, defendant claimed that the injury
resulted from the child bumping her eye
<Page 819>
on the bathroom doorknob. The officer
testified that defendant was charged with
and ultimately convicted of cruelty to a
child. Defendant did not object to admission
of the officer's testimony. Immediately
following the testimony, the court instructed
the jury that it could not consider
the evidence to prove that defendant acted
in the same way towards O.S. The court
stated that the evidence was to be used
only in assessing defendant's "state of
mind or intention in his conduct towards
[O.S.], that's all. Just as to state of mind or
intention. That is, whether he was acting
willfully." Defendant did not testify or
present any evidence.

<P20>&para; 11. Prior to its deliberations, the court
instructed the jury on the permissible use
of defendant's prior conviction. The court
explained that the jury could not consider
the prior conviction "as tending to prove
that [defendant] was acting in the same
way, or doing the same thing that he did
previously in his conduct toward [O.S.]."
The court instructed the jury that the
evidence was only relevant to "assessing
what [defendant's] state of mind or intention
was in his conduct toward [O.S.]. That
is, whether he acted willfully, and whether
his conduct was intended to cause unnecessary
suffering, and to disprove any claim
that [O.S.'s] injuries were caused by accident
or mistake." Defendant made no objection
to this instruction. The court also
outlined the essential elements of the
charge that the State was required to
prove, including that defendant acted willfully
and that his actions caused O.S. unnecessary
suffering or endangered O.S.'s
health. The jury found defendant guilty of
cruelty to a child, serious injury resulting.

<P20>&para; 12. On appeal, defendant argues that
the court erred in allowing the State to
introduce evidence of defendant's prior
conviction. Evidence of other crimes is admissible
under Rule 404(b) for limited purposes.
Prior crimes may not be admitted to
show a person's character trait or to prove
a person has a propensity to act in a
particular manner. This evidence may,
however, be admitted to prove "motive,
opportunity, intent, preparation, plan,
knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake
or accident." V.R.E. 404(b). Even if admissible
under Rule 404(b), prior convictions
may still be excluded under Rule 403 if the
"probative value is substantially out-weighed
by the danger of unfair prejudice,
confusion of the issues, or misleading the
jury, or by considerations of undue delay,
waste of time, or needless presentation of
cumulative evidence."

<P20>&para; 13. The burden is on the State
"to show precisely how the proffered evidence
is relevant to the theory advanced,
how the issue to which it is addressed is
related to the disputed elements in the
case, and how the probative value of the
evidence is not substantially outweighed
by its prejudicial effect." <EMU>State v. Lipka</EMU>,
174 Vt. 377, 391, 817 A.2d 27, 38-39 (2002)
(quotation omitted). The trial court has
deference to admit evidence for these purposes
and this Court reviews for an abuse
of discretion. <EMU>State v. Menize</EMU>, 2023 VT 48,
&para; 22, 218 Vt. ___, 308 A.3d 507. Where, as
here, the error is not preserved below, this
Court reviews for plain error, which "exists
only in extraordinary situations where
the error is obvious and strikes at the
heart of defendant's constitutional rights
or results in a miscarriage of justice."
<EMU>State v. Lucas</EMU>, 2015 VT 92, &para; 9, 200 Vt.
239, 129 A.3d 646 (alteration and quotation
omitted).

<P20>&para; 14. The admission of defendant's
prior conviction did not amount to plain
error in this case. The evidence was relevant
and was used for a legitimate purpose.
The State offered the evidence to
demonstrate motive or intent in conformance
<Page 820>
with Rule 404(b).<fnr1> The charge of cruelty
to a child required the State to prove
that defendant injured O.S. "willfully," 13
V.S.A. &sect; 1304(a), meaning "intentionally
and by design." <EMU>State v. Amsden</EMU>, 2013 VT
51, &para; 34, 194 Vt. 128, 75 A.3d 612 (alteration
and quotation omitted). Defendant's
prior conviction of cruelty to a child was
relevant to this element.<fnr2>

<P20>&para; 15. Defendant asserts that evidence of
intent was not relevant where defendant
did not assert mistake or accidental injury
as a defense at trial. Because willfulness
was an element of the offense, the State
had an affirmative obligation to prove defendant
acted with the requisite intent.
Moreover, although defendant did not testify
and personally assert that the injuries
may have been caused accidentally, during
the investigation he offered innocent explanations
for O.S.'s injuries and indicated the
injuries may have been inflicted accidentally.
For example, O.S.'s mother testified
that when she confronted defendant about
O.S.'s injuries and defendant's behavior towards
O.S., defendant asserted that he did
not intend to injure O.S. Evidence regarding
defendant's intent was therefore relevant
and defendant's prior conviction of
cruelty to a child was admissible under
Rule 404(b) to demonstrate that defendant
acted willfully as required by the statute.

<P20>&para; 16. There is no merit to defendant's
assertion that the prior conviction
lacked relevance and was therefore inadmissible
under Rule 404(b) because the
prior conviction involved acts against a
different child. In making this argument
defendant relies on domestic-assault cases
involving prior bad acts toward the same
victim. For example, in <EMU>State v. Hendricks</EMU>,
evidence of the defendant's prior physical
violence towards the victim was admitted
for the particular purpose of providing
context for the defendant's relationship to
the victim. 173 Vt. 132, 139, 787 A.2d 1270,
1276 (2001) (explaining that prior domestic
assault may be admitted in domestic-violence
case because allegations, "taken out
of its situational context, are likely to seem
incongruous and incredible to a jury" (quotation
omitted)). The purpose for admitting
the prior conviction here is different than
in <EMU>Hendricks</EMU> and other domestic-assault
cases where context is required to understand
the dynamics of the relationship between
the defendant and the victim. In this
case, defendant's prior conviction was admitted
for the specific purpose of demonstrating
intent or lack of mistake&mdash;a required
element of the charge&mdash;and not to
give context regarding the relationship between
defendant and O.S. Rule 404(b) is
not limited to admitting prior convictions
or bad acts of a defendant against the
same victim. See <EMU>State v. Cardinal</EMU>, 155 Vt.
411, 415, 584 A.2d 1152, 1155 (1990) (affirming
trial court's admission of defendant's
threatening behavior towards victim's
partner to demonstrate defendant's
state of mind as jealous lover). The conviction
here was relevant to proving intent
and therefore admissible under Rule
404(b).

<P20>&para; 17. Defendant also argues that
admitting the prior conviction was overly
prejudicial and therefore amounted to
plain error. Prior bad acts, even if relevant,
may be excluded if the probative
value is substantially outweighed by unfair
<Page 821>
prejudicial effect. V.R.E. 403. In assessing
whether there is unfair prejudice, the trial
court has "substantial discretion," and may
consider different factors including the
need for the prior conviction in light of the
other evidence, the degree of probative
value, and "the extent to which the jury is
likely to be aroused to hostility by the
evidence." <EMU>State v. Hinchliffe</EMU>, 2009 VT 111,
&para; 28, 186 Vt. 487, 987 A.2d 988 (quotation
omitted). Here, as set forth above, the
prior conviction was relevant to proving
willfulness, which was an element of the
offense. The trial court determined that
admission of the prior conviction was not
so inflammatory as to outweigh this relevance,
especially because this was a prior
conviction and not uncharged misconduct,
so it did not require extensive testimony or
necessitate a mini-trial. See <EMU>State v.
Burke</EMU>, 2012 VT 50, &para; 21, 192 Vt. 99, 54
A.3d 500 (affirming exclusion of evidence
where "mini-trial would have been required
to determine whether the third party
did assault complainant's friend, and the
evidence would have likely distracted the
jury and confused the issues").

<P20>&para; 18. The court's weighing of the
Rule 403 factors and decision to admit the
evidence did not rise to the level of plain
error. Plain error is guided by four factors:
"(1) there must be an error; (2) the error
must be obvious; (3) the error must affect
substantial rights and result in prejudice
to the defendant; and (4) we must correct
the error if it seriously affects the fairness,
integrity, or public reputation of judicial
proceedings." <EMU>State v. Herrick</EMU>, 2011 VT
94, &para; 18, 190 Vt. 292, 30 A.3d 1285. Plain
error is a "very high bar" that is present
"only in rare and extraordinary cases." <EMU>Id</EMU>.
Here, we need not address all the plain-error
factors because defendant has not
demonstrated that admission of the evidence
resulted in prejudice or seriously
affected the fairness, integrity, or public
reputation of the judicial proceedings. The
prior conviction was a small part of the
evidence presented at trial. This was a
four-day trial involving eleven witnesses.
The prior conviction was introduced during
one witness's testimony and took minimal
time. Moreover, the court diminished any
prejudicial impact of the evidence by providing
instructions to the jury both immediately
after the testimony and prior to
deliberations. See <EMU>State v. Longley</EMU>, 2007
VT 101, &para; 22, 182 Vt. 452, 939 A.2d 1028
(affirming admission of prior citation
where limiting instruction made immediately
after testimony). Given this context,
admitting evidence of defendant's prior
conviction did not amount to plain error.

<P20><EMU>Affirmed</EMU>.
<FN>
<fnt1> The State proffered that the evidence was
relevant to "demonstrating proof of intent,
knowledge, and/or absence of mistake or accident."

<fnt2> On appeal, the State also argues that the
prior conviction was relevant to proving an
additional element-that defendant's actions
caused O.S. "unnecessary suffering" or endangered
O.S.'s health. 13 V.S.A. &sect; 1304(a).
We need not reach this question.

<P20>&para; 1. Defendant Larry Labrecque appeals
a jury verdict finding him guilty of one
count of sexual assault. We affirm.

<P20>&para; 2. The State presented the following
evidence at trial. In May 2018, complainant,
complainant's mother, complainant's
younger brother, defendant, and defendant's
son from a prior relationship all
lived in a small apartment in Hartford
Village. Complainant was seventeen years
old and a junior in high school at the time.
On the morning of May 14, 2018, complainant
was unclothed in the bathroom, getting
ready to take a shower. She thought everyone
was asleep. Defendant then entered
the bathroom, bent complainant over
the sink, and penetrated her vagina with
his penis. Defendant ejaculated into the
toilet or into a tissue that he flushed down
the toilet. Complainant did not want to
have sex with defendant but did not protest
because, after years of similar conduct,
she had "just given up." She showered,
put on clean clothes, including new
underwear, and went to school.

<P20>&para; 3. Following a conversation about the
incident with her boyfriend, complainant
reported it to her high-school guidance
counselor. A police officer transported
complainant to the hospital for an examination
designed to provide sexual-assault
victims with appropriate medical care and
to collect evidence. Hospital staff collected
samples of complainant's clothing and vaginal
swabs for DNA analysis. An initial test
of complainant's underwear revealed a positive
<Page 824>
result for the presence of acid phosphatase
and prostate specific antigens.
This finding was consistent with the probable
presence of seminal fluid. Further testing
of the underwear showed that defendant's
DNA was a match to the prostate
specific antigens found on complainant's
underwear.<fnr1> Defendant's DNA was not
found in the vaginal swabs.

<P20>&para; 4. As amended, the State charged defendant
with two counts of aggravated sexual
assault and one count of sexual assault,
no consent. The case was tried to a jury in
May 2022. The jury acquitted defendant of
the two aggravated-sexual-assault charges
but returned a guilty verdict on the charge
of sexual assault, no consent.

<P20>&para; 5. Defendant moved for a new trial.
The trial court denied the motion and sentenced
defendant to a minimum of ten
years with a maximum term of life to
serve, all suspended except four years.
This appeal followed.

<P20>&para; 6. Defendant argues that the court
committed plain error on several evidentiary
matters involving the State chemist,
and a former Hartford Town Police Department
detective who was the lead investigating
officer. While defendant objected
below to the rulings he challenges on appeal,
he contends, for the first time on
appeal, that the alleged errors deprived
him of due process and confrontation
rights. Because defendant did not raise
these constitutional claims below, we review
for plain error. See <EMU>State v. Bubar</EMU>,
146 Vt. 398, 400, 505 A.2d 1197, 1199 (1985)
("An objection on one ground does not
preserve an appeal on other grounds.").

<P20>&para; 7. Our review for plain error
focuses on whether there was obvious error
that affected the defendant's substantial
rights and resulted in prejudice to the
defendant. <EMU>State v. Ray</EMU>, 2019 VT 51, &para; 6,
210 Vt. 496, 216 A.3d 1274. To this end, we
will reverse a conviction where there was
obvious error that compromised the fairness,
integrity, or public reputation of judicial
proceedings. <EMU>Id</EMU>. "This is a very high
bar&mdash;we find plain error only in rare and
extraordinary circumstances." <EMU>Id</EMU>. (quotation
omitted). We conclude that the court
committed no error, and therefore no plain
error.

<P20>&para; 8. Defendant first asserts that the
court erred when it refused to permit him
to impeach the State chemist about an
alleged prior inconsistent statement. Defendant's
theory at trial was that his DNA
could have been transferred to complainant's
underwear via "indirect transfer," for
example, in the laundry. Defense counsel
had the following exchange with the State
chemist during a pretrial deposition:

<B22>DEFENSE COUNSEL: Given the state
of things, wouldn't it be more likely that
um the, [defendant's] DNA ... got
[onto complainant's underwear] from the
laundry?

<B22>THE STATE CHEMIST: Like I said
that's an explanation but it doesn't necessarily
mean that's what happened.
<Page 825>

<B22>DEFENSE COUNSEL: Um, the same
could be said for it coming there
through a sexual act too, it's an explanation
but it doesn't mean that's what happened.

<B22>THE STATE CHEMIST: Correct.

<P00>On direct examination at trial, the State
chemist testified that it was his opinion
that the transfer of defendant's DNA to
complainant's underwear was more likely
the result of "a more direct contact" than
an indirect transfer from the laundry.

<P20>&para; 9. On cross-examination, defense counsel
asked the State chemist this question:
"Did you ever give testimony in your depositions
about ... [t]he likelihood of how
the manner of transfer of DNA on to the
fabrics you tested?" The State chemist
stated that he did not think he had been
asked that question before trial. The State
chemist continued: "I believe the question
to me was whether it was possible it was
transferred [through the laundry]. Yeah,
it's possible." Defense counsel then asked:
"So this is the first time in this case, after
two depositions, that you're talking about
probability[?]"

<P20>&para; 10. The court stopped the cross-examination
and ultimately refused to allow defense
counsel to pursue a line of questioning
meant to impeach the State chemist for
being untruthful about his deposition testimony.
The court concluded that the State
chemist had been asked a different question
during the deposition and had been
truthful during his trial testimony when he
stated that he had never been asked about
whether direct transfer was the more likely
explanation.

<P20>&para; 11. We conclude that the questions
posed during the deposition and at trial
were each intended to elicit testimony
about the likelihood of one method of DNA
transfer over the other. We are unpersuaded
by the State's argument that the
questions were not the same for purposes
of impeachment because the question at
trial was the "inverse" of the one asked
during the deposition. We nevertheless affirm
because the record supports the
court's determination that the State chemist's
deposition testimony was not inconsistent
with his trial testimony, which is the
critical inquiry. See <EMU>State v. VanBuren</EMU>,
2018 VT 95, &para; 70, 210 Vt. 293, 214 A.3d 791
(explaining that "[t]his Court may affirm
the trial court's judgment on any basis").

<P20>&para; 12. "Vermont Rule of Evidence
613(b) governs the admission of out-of-court
statements used to impeach a witness."
<EMU>State v. Kelley</EMU>, 2016 VT 58, &para; 36,
202 Vt. 174, 148 A.3d 191. Rule 613(b)
includes "strict limits against the admission
of the statement itself." <EMU>Id</EMU>. (quotation
omitted). While prior inconsistent
statements can be used to impeach the
credibility of a witness, "the court must
be persuaded that the statements are indeed
inconsistent." <EMU>United States v. Hale</EMU>,
422 U.S. 171, 176, 95 S.Ct. 2133, 45
L.Ed.2d 99 (1975).

<P20>&para; 13. During the deposition, the State
chemist made the following statement in
response to a question about whether it
was more likely that the DNA transferred
in the laundry: "Like I said that's an explanation,
but it doesn't necessarily mean
that's what happened." The State chemist's
statement, which was effectively unresponsive
to the question asked, addressed the
possibility of the indirect-transfer theory.
His trial statement, on the other hand, was
an opinion that the direct-transfer method
was the more likely explanation as between
the two theories. These two statements
are not inconsistent because they
address different concepts&mdash;whether the
occurrence of an event was <EMU>possible</EMU> versus
whether the occurrence of an event was
<EMU>probable</EMU>. Had defense counsel asked follow-up
questions during the deposition to
<Page 826>
pin down the State chemist's position on
the probability or likelihood of indirect
transfer, we would be able to evaluate
whether the chemist gave an inconsistent
opinion on that topic at trial. On this record,
we cannot. It was not error to refuse
defense counsel's request to impeach the
State chemist pursuant to Rule 613(b).

<P20>&para; 14. Defendant also contends that he
was prejudiced by the State's failure to
disclose that the State chemist would testify
about the probability of the method of
transfer of the DNA at trial. This argument
is unavailing.

<P20>&para; 15. "Vermont Rule of Criminal
Procedure 16(a)(2)(C) requires the State to
disclose the reports of experts, `including
results of physical or mental examinations
and of scientific tests, experiments, or
comparisons.'" <EMU>State v. Provost</EMU>, 2005 VT
134, &para; 11, 179 Vt. 337, 896 A.2d 55 (quoting
Vermont Rule of Criminal Procedure
16(a)(2)(C)). Defendant bears the burden
of showing a rule violation and that the
violation prejudiced his defense "in some
meaningful manner." <EMU>Id</EMU>. (quotation omitted).

<P20>&para; 16. The State chemist testified during
the pretrial depositions that he did not find
defendant's DNA in the epithelial screen
using the differential-extraction test. He
did find defendant's DNA in the sperm
screen. Thus, according to him, the more
likely explanation was transfer by direct
contact between defendant's ejaculate and
complainant's underwear. This was an obvious
inference, which the State raised in
its motion papers. We are therefore not
persuaded that defendant lacked sufficient
notice of the substance of the State chemist's
testimony.

<P20>&para; 17. We encountered a similar situation
in <EMU>Provost</EMU>, 2005 VT 134, &para; 13, 179 Vt. 337,
896 A.2d 55. In <EMU>Provost</EMU>, a medical examiner's
testimony about the effects of a victim's
fatal gunshot wound tended to undermine
the defendant's version of events.
The medical examiner did not include the
opinion he expressed at trial about the
effects of the wound in his reports detailing
the autopsy of the victim. We held that
"[w]hile [the] defendant may have been
prejudiced by [the medical examiner's] <EMU>testimony</EMU>,
which was at least somewhat inconsistent
with defendant's version of
events, he was not prejudiced by the lack
of <EMU>notice</EMU> of this testimony." <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 13. We
explained that the defendant had waived
his right to depose the medical examiner,
gave no basis for undermining the medical
examiner's testimony, and did not offer a
strategy to limit the effect of the testimony.
<EMU>Id</EMU>. &para;&para; 12-13.

<P20>&para; 18. As in <EMU>Provost</EMU>, even assuming
defendant received insufficient notice of
the State chemist's testimony, he has
failed to demonstrate prejudice. Defense
counsel availed himself of the opportunity
&mdash;twice&mdash;to depose the State chemist. It
should have come as no surprise that the
State chemist discounted the laundry theory
in comparison to the direct contact theory
at trial, because he did throughout the
litigation, including during the depositions.
Defense counsel had ample opportunity before
trial to ask the State chemist precisely
what his opinion was concerning how
defendant's DNA was transferred to complainant's
underwear. Moreover, defendant
called his own expert to testify about the
DNA transfer, who stated that he could
not reach an opinion on how defendant's
DNA was found on complainant's underwear.
The jury was free to credit the
competing expert testimonies accordingly.
See <EMU>State v. Scott</EMU>, 2013 VT 103, &para; 17, 195
Vt. 330, 88 A.3d 1173 (affirming decision to
permit State's expert witness to testify as
to defendant's speed in fatal car accident
where defendant's challenges went to expert's
credibility rather than testimony's
admissibility and where defendant cross-examined
<Page 827>
State's expert and offered testimony
of his own expert). Defendant does
not explain how he would have acted differently
if he had notice of the testimony.
Based on the foregoing, we conclude that
defendant has failed to demonstrate prejudice
resulting from the allegedly insufficient
notice.

<P20>&para; 19. Defendant next challenges two of
the court's evidentiary rulings regarding
the lead investigator, a former Hartford
Town Police Department detective. Defendant
contends that it was plain error to
exclude testimony from other police officers
about the detective's termination from
employment under Vermont Rule of Evidence
405(b) and testimony from the process
server that the detective refused service
of process under Vermont Rule of
Evidence 403.

<P20>&para; 20. In July 2020, the state's attorney
issued a <EMU>Brady</EMU> letter to the defense bar
stating that the detective had been terminated
for being untruthful about her actual
location during an emergency call and misrepresenting
that she was sick when she
was actually at Logan Airport preparing to
travel. The detective was terminated after
she conducted the investigation in this
case.

<P20>&para; 21. Defendant sought to undermine the
State's case by calling the detective to
testify and posing questions to her about
how she conducted her portions of the
investigation. Defendant also wanted to
connect the detective's termination and the
circumstances surrounding it to how the
entire investigation was conducted. Defendant
attempted to serve a subpoena on the
detective two days before trial. Service
was unsuccessful. Defendant made no further
attempt to serve the detective, and
she did not attend trial. Instead, defendant
sought to question other testifying police
officers about why she was terminated.<fnr2>

<P20>&para; 22. Defendant's justification for relying
on the <EMU>Brady</EMU> letter at trial was that it
went "to the professionalism, the credibility
of all the police witnesses and their
work as a department." He argued that
evidence of the detective's termination
went "to show whether or not the police
force as a whole did a professional investigation
where they knew of the maleficence
of one officer&mdash;or the lead detective." The
court asked whether the allegations in the
<EMU>Brady</EMU> letter were related to or contemporaneous
with the investigation into complainant's
allegations. Defense counsel represented
that they were not related or
contemporaneous. The court then asked
defense counsel whether he would be able
to offer specific instances of conduct under
Rule 405(b). Defense counsel responded,
"under 405, no."

<P20>&para; 23. The court excluded the evidence as
irrelevant and acted within its discretion in
so doing. It concluded that "any testimony
regarding an attempt to serve a witness on
a single day" was not "probative of any
issues that the jury must decide in this
case."

<P20>&para; 24. Defendant contends on appeal
that the evidence was admissible under
Rule 405(b). Rule 405(b) provides that, "in
cases in which character or a trait of character
of a person is an essential element of
a charge, claim, or defense, proof may also
be made of specific instances of his conduct."
However, defendant waived this argument
by conceding to the trial court that
specific instances of the detective's character
were not admissible under Rule 405
given the purposes for which he sought to
introduce them. See <EMU>State v. Griswold</EMU>, 172
Vt. 443, 446-47, 782 A.2d 1144, 1147 (2001)
<Page 828>
(holding that in case where defendant was
convicted of aggravated sexual assault,
specific instances of victim's history as victim
of domestic violence committed by
third party were not admissible under
Rule 405(b) because defendant's asserted
defenses were consent and mistaken identity);
see also <EMU>State v. Morse</EMU>, 2019 VT 58,
&para; 7, 211 Vt. 130, 219 A.3d 1309 (holding
that defendant waived challenge to conviction
by agreeing to proposed jury instruction
that defendant later sought to appeal
as erroneous). Because the circumstances
surrounding the detective's termination
were neither related to or contemporaneous
with the investigation in this case, and
because defense counsel conceded that he
could not introduce the evidence under
Rule 405(b), the court did not err in excluding
it.

<P20>&para; 25. Defendant's last contention
is that the court erred when it did not
permit him to call the process server to
testify that the detective had refused service.
He asserts that this error deprived
him of an opportunity to present a complete
defense because he had a right to
show the jury why the lead investigator
was not at trial. The court concluded that
testimony about a single attempt to serve
the detective two days before trial was not
probative of any issue in the case and was
therefore substantially outweighed by its
prejudicial effect. See V.R.E. 403 ("Although
relevant, evidence may be excluded
if its probative value is substantially outweighed
by the danger of unfair prejudice,
confusion of the issues, or misleading the
jury, or by considerations of undue delay,
waste of time, or needless presentation of
cumulative evidence.").

<P20>&para; 26. "Rule 403 rulings are
highly discretionary." <EMU>State v. Lee</EMU>, 2005
VT 99, &para; 11, 178 Vt. 420, 886 A.2d 378
(quotation omitted). "Absent an abuse of
discretion, in which the court either totally
withholds or exercises its discretion on
clearly untenable or unreasonable grounds,
the trial court's evidentiary ruling stands
on appeal." <EMU>State v. Ogden</EMU>, 161 Vt. 336,
341, 640 A.2d 6, 10 (1993). Setting aside
the question of whether a single attempt to
serve the detective with a subpoena two
days prior to trial would merit the process
server's testimony in this case, we conclude
that the trial court properly excluded
the testimony under Rule 403. Defense
counsel represented that the process server
was prepared to testify as to the contents
of an email he sent to defense counsel,
which recounted the details of the
service attempt on the detective. The email
stated that he attempted service at the
detective's apartment, left a business card
at the apartment, and that a person who
the process server took to be the detective
later called him and said, "I can't help
you," and hung up. The process server also
texted photos of the subpoena to the detective's
number but received no response.

<P20>&para; 27. To the extent the foregoing was
probative of a fact in issue-which is
doubtful&mdash;the trial court acted within its
discretion in determining that the putative
testimony was substantially outweighed by
its prejudicial effect. For example, it is not
clear that the person who called the process
server was, in fact, the detective; nor
is it clear that she could have physically
participated as a witness in the trial.
Moreover, even if the detective did call the
process server and could have attended
trial, the court permitted defendant to
cross-examine other police officers about
the conduct of the investigation. The court
also ruled that defendant could not introduce
evidence of the circumstances surrounding
the detective's termination. Accordingly,
the detective's purported refusal
to be served&mdash;even if true&mdash;was not in
issue. See <EMU>State v. Webster</EMU>, 165 Vt. 54, 57-58,
675 A.2d 1330, 1333 (1996) (affirming
exclusion of testimonial evidence under
Rule 403 that victim of domestic abuse was
having affair with lead investigator because
<Page 829>
lead investigator did not testify and
therefore his bias was not in issue, and his
actions and motives had no bearing on
victim's credibility, which defendant sought
to undermine). We also observe that defense
counsel did not move for a continuance
to have the detective appear at a
later date. Cf. <EMU>State v. Heffernan</EMU>, 2017 VT
113, &para;&para; 22-23, 206 Vt. 261, 180 A.3d 579
(holding that defendant was prejudiced by
court's denial of his motion to continue
trial where defendant's key witness was
hospitalized and unable to attend trial).
Under these circumstances, the trial court
did not err in denying defendant's request
to have the process server testify.

<P20>&para; 28. Finally, to the extent that defendant
is arguing his conviction should be
reversed because of the cumulative effect
of the trial court's evidentiary rulings, we
disagree. Defendant was not prejudiced by
any issue he raises on appeal, and therefore
there is no cumulative prejudicial effect.
See <EMU>State v. Noyes</EMU>, 2021 VT 50, &para; 46,
215 Vt. 182, 260 A.3d 1132 ("[B]ecause we
have determined no prejudice resulted
from any of the circumstances identified
by [the] defendant, there can be no resulting
cumulative prejudicial effect.").

<P20><EMU>Affirmed</EMU>.
<FN>
<fnt1> The State chemist testified that the process
used to determine the presence of DNA from
sperm cells or seminal fluid as opposed to
DNA from epithelial cells&mdash;such as skin&mdash;is
called a "differential-extraction" test. In a differential-extraction
test, the tester can separate
epithelial cells from sperm cells because
sperm cells have thick protein coats that do
not break down as easily as epithelial cells. A
buffer is added to a sample&mdash;here, a piece of
complainant's underwear&mdash;that breaks down
the epithelial cells, making DNA extraction
from epithelial cells possible. This is called
the "epithelial fraction," and may include
skin and other tissues. The remainder of the
sample is called the "sperm fraction." A different
buffer is added to that solution permitting
DNA extraction if any is present. DNA
can be extracted from both fractions.

<fnt2> Defendant also sought to offer deposition
testimony given by the detective under Vermont
Rule of Evidence 804. The court denied
the motion. Defendant does not appeal that
decision.

<P20>&para; 1. This appeal arises from a decision of
defendant Department of Forests, Parks,
and Recreation (FPR), which determined
that plaintiffs William and Mary Fulton
used their property in a manner inconsistent
with the terms of the Agricultural and
Managed Forest Land Use Value Appraisal
Program (Current Use program). Plaintiffs
claim that the trial court erred in
affirming FPR's decision to disenroll the
property from the Current Use program
for plaintiffs' impermissible tree-cutting
activities. We affirm.

<P20>&para; 2. The following facts are drawn from
the record and are not in dispute.<fnr1> On
August 2, 2021, plaintiffs purchased property
in the Town of Jericho consisting of
approximately thirty-two acres of land.<fnr2> At
the time of purchase, the property was
subject to a ten-year forest management
plan, approved by FPR in July 2016, pursuant
to the property's enrollment in the
Current Use program as managed forestland.
See 32 V.S.A. &sect;&sect; 3751-3776. The Current
Use program is designed to provide
tax incentives to property owners who
maintain their property according to an
approved management plan. See <EMU>id</EMU>.
&sect;&sect; 3751-3752, 3756-3757; see also <EMU>Jones v.
Dep't of Forests, Parks & Recreation</EMU>, 2004
VT 49, &para; 2, 177 Vt. 81, 857 A.2d 271
(providing brief overview of Current Use
program's purpose). Here, the plan generally
prohibited tree cutting on the property
except under limited circumstances.

<P20>&para; 3. Prior to completing their purchase
of the property, plaintiffs contacted FPR
and the Department of Taxes, Division of
Property Valuation and Review (PVR).
Plaintiffs inquired about the status of the
property's enrollment in the Current Use
program and potentially converting the
property from managed forestland to agricultural
land. Plaintiffs were informed that
the property remained enrolled in the Current
Use program as managed forestland
and that, should they wish to convert the
property from forestland to agricultural,
they would need to take several steps, one
of which included amending the plan. They
were also cautioned that any tree cutting
in violation of the plan would lead to the
property's removal from the Current Use
program and, consequentially, tax penalties.

<P20>&para; 4. On August 9, 2021, after plaintiffs
purchased the property, the Town of Jericho
recorded plaintiffs' property-transfer
tax return. Plaintiffs indicated on the tax
return that they had elected to continue
the property's enrollment in the Current
Use program. See 32 V.S.A. &sect; 3756(e) (requiring
<Page 832>
new owner of enrolled property
who wishes to continue enrollment to indicate
as much on property-transfer tax return
at time of transfer). Three days later,
PVR notified plaintiffs by letter that, to
maintain the property's enrollment, they
must submit the required application with
PVR and pay the statutory fee. See <EMU>id</EMU>.
(requiring new owner of enrolled property
who elects continued enrollment to submit
application and statutory fee within thirty
days of municipality receiving property-transfer
tax return). The letter further
explained that, if plaintiffs did not wish to
continue the property's enrollment in the
Current Use program, they must provide
PVR with a completed notice-of-withdrawal
form within thirty days; otherwise, PVR
would begin the process of disenrolling the
property. See <EMU>id</EMU>. &sect; 3757(b) ("Any owner of
eligible land who wishes to withdraw land
from use value appraisal shall notify the
Director [of PVR]."). Plaintiffs neither
filed an application to continue enrollment
nor submitted a notice of withdrawal.

<P20>&para; 5. In September 2021, the county forester
received a complaint about tree cutting
on the property. After confirming
with PVR that the property was still enrolled
in the Current Use program, the
forester drove by the property and saw
evidence of tree cutting. That same month,
plaintiffs contacted the Agency of Agriculture,
Food, and Markets (AAFM) to inquire
about obtaining a farm determination
for the property because they wished
to use the property for agricultural purposes.
A representative from AAFM advised
plaintiffs that they needed to submit
a farm-business plan and obtain a farm-determination
letter from AAFM to qualify
for any regulatory exemptions for using
the property for farming.

<P20>&para; 6. On October 5, 2021, PVR informed
plaintiffs that, if it did not "receive either a
Notice of Withdrawal Form or the application
materials from [plaintiffs] within 30
days," PVR would "begin the process to
discontinue the enrollment of [the] property
from the Current Use Program." Plaintiffs
did not respond and took no action.<fnr3>

<P20>&para; 7. On October 18, 2021, the county
forester left a voicemail with plaintiffs notifying
them that he intended to inspect
the property if they did not return his call
within ten days. Plaintiffs did not respond.
Instead, they submitted a farm-development
plan to AAFM ten days later.

<P20>&para; 8. Receiving no response from plaintiffs,
the county forester inspected the
property in November 2021 and observed
extensive tree-cutting on the property in
violation of the forest management plan.
The forester subsequently issued a conformance-inspection
report documenting
the violation and recommending to FPR
that the property be removed from the
Current Use program.

<P20>&para; 9. In December 2021, FPR adopted
the conformance-inspection report and issued
an adverse-inspection report concluding
that plaintiffs had improperly engaged
in development by cutting trees on the
property in violation of the plan. FPR sent
the report to plaintiffs and informed them
that the property would be removed from
the Current Use program, plaintiffs would
incur a tax penalty, and the property
would be ineligible for enrollment in the
Current Use program for five years. The
report was also forwarded to PVR. 32
V.S.A. &sect; 3755(d) (providing that property
removed from Current Use program as
result of adverse inspection report "shall
not be considered [for enrollment] for a
<Page 833>
period of five years"); <EMU>id</EMU>. &sect; 3756(i)(1) (mandating
removal of property subject to adverse-inspection
report from Current Use
program).

<P20>&para; 10. Later that same month, AAFM
issued a farm determination that the property
was eligible for farm use. However,
AAFM's determination did not convert the
property into agricultural land and did not
change any aspect of the forestry-management
plan. The determination also did not
affect the property's enrollment in the
Current Use program. Plaintiffs did not
attempt to convert the property from forestry
to agricultural land through the
PVR-delineated process until January
2022.

<P20>&para; 11. In October 2022, the Commissioner
of FPR issued a decision affirming the
adverse inspection report and largely upholding
the report's findings.<fnr4> The Commissioner
concluded that plaintiffs' tree
cutting violated the forestry-management
plan and thus constituted "development."
The Commissioner's decision was reported
to PVR and the Town of Jericho. See <EMU>id</EMU>.
&sect; 3757(a)-(d), (f) (providing for tax consequences
and tax-lien obligations of property
owner when owner develops land or
property is withdrawn from Current Use
program).

<P20>&para; 12. Plaintiffs appealed from the Commissioner's
decision to the superior court
which, after receiving cross-motions, rendered
summary judgment in favor of FPR.
The court concluded "that the property
had not been removed from the Current
Use program at the time of the tree-cutting,"
explaining that plaintiffs' failure to
apply for continued enrollment and pay
the statutory fee did not result in automatic
disenrollment. It further determined
that plaintiffs did not convert the property
from forestland to agricultural land since
they failed to pursue the established process
for making that conversion. The court
also rejected plaintiffs' argument that their
tree-cutting was exempted from the definition
of "development" under &sect; 3752(5)(E).
This appeal followed.

<P20>&para; 13. We review a decision granting
summary judgment de novo, using the
same standard as the trial court. <EMU>Vt. Coll.
of Fine Arts v. City of Montpelier</EMU>, 2017
VT 12, &para; 7, 204 Vt. 215, 165 A.3d 1065.
"Summary judgment is appropriate when,
construing the facts as alleged by the non-moving
party and resolving reasonable
doubts and inferences in favor of the non-moving
party, there are no genuine issues
of material fact and judgment is appropriate
as a matter of law." <EMU>Sheldon v. Ruggiero</EMU>,
2018 VT 125, &para; 14, 209 Vt. 33, 202 A.3d
241 (citing V.R.C.P. 56). In our review of
such a motion, "we regard as true all
allegations of the nonmoving party supported
by admissible evidence and give the
nonmoving party the benefit of all reasonable
doubts and inferences." <EMU>Wood v. Wallin</EMU>,
2024 VT 21, &para; 8, ___ Vt. ___, 316 A.3d
266 (quotation omitted). Our review of legal
questions raised in a motion for summary
judgment is plenary and nondeferential.
<EMU>Hardwick Recycling & Salvage, Inc. v.
Acadia Ins. Co.</EMU>, 2004 VT 124, &para; 14, 177 Vt.
421, 869 A.2d 82.

<P20>&para; 14. In their first claim on appeal,
plaintiffs argue that because they did not
submit the required application and statutory
fee to keep the property enrolled in
the Current Use program within thirty
days after the Town of Jericho received
the property-transfer tax return, the property
was automatically disenrolled from
the program. Plaintiffs effectively argue
<Page 834>
that, pursuant to &sect; 3756(e), removal from
the Current Use program is automatic if a
new owner does not take the required
steps within the specified timeline. We disagree.

<P20>&para; 15. To resolve this claim, we
must interpret the relevant statutes. In
doing so, our role is to presume that the
Legislature "intended the plain, ordinary
meaning of the adopted statutory language,"
and we will apply that language
where the meaning is clear and unambiguous.
<EMU>Wesco, Inc. v. Sorrell</EMU>, 2004 VT 102,
&para; 14, 177 Vt. 287, 865 A.2d 350. When
tasked to interpret a tax-exemption statute,
as here, "[o]ur rule that tax statutes
should be strictly construed against the
party claiming exemption must be tempered
by the paramount concern that statutes
be construed reasonably so as not to
defeat their purpose." <EMU>Mollica v. Div. of
Prop. Valuation & Rev.</EMU>, 2008 VT 60, &para; 10,
184 Vt. 83, 955 A.2d 1171 (quotation omitted);
see <EMU>id</EMU>. (applying rules governing interpretation
of tax statutes when interpreting
Current Use statutory scheme).

<P20>&para; 16. Section 3756(e) provides, in relevant
part, that when a property enrolled in
the Current Use program is transferred to
another owner:

<B22>the new owner shall be entitled to continue
to have the eligible property appraised
at its use value, provided the
property remains eligible and provided
the new owner shall elect the continuation
of use value appraisal on the property
transfer tax return at the time of
transfer and, within 30 days after the
property transfer tax return has been
received by the municipality for recording,
has applied to the Director [of PVR]
and paid the fees described in this subsection.

<P00>32 V.S.A. &sect; 3756(e).

<P20>&para; 17. The plain language of &sect; 3756(e)
does not provide that a new owner's failure
to comply with its terms results in the
property's automatic removal from the
Current Use program. Relatedly,
&sect; 3757(e)(3) does state that "[a] transfer of
ownership, alone, will not affect eligibility
of the parcel." Upon a transfer of ownership,
however, the failure of a new owner
"to provide maps, a new application, or
transfer information to [PVR] within 30
days of a request being sent by certified
mail by the Director will result in removal
of the parcel from the program." <EMU>Id</EMU>.

<P20>&para; 18. Neither &sect; 3756(e) nor &sect; 3757(e)(3)
sets forth any process for disenrollment.
Despite the statutes' silence on that issue,
the plain language indicates that the Legislature
did not intend for a property to be
automatically disenrolled if a new property
owner fails to submit an application or pay
the statutory fee within the thirty-day period.
Rather, the statutes make clear that
the Director of PVR controls removal from
the Current Use program. While a new
owner must file an application with the
Director and pay the statutory fee within
thirty days after the municipality receives
the property-transfer tax return, &sect; 3756(e),
a property will not be removed unless that
owner fails to submit that application within
thirty days of the Director's written
request, &sect; 3757(e)(3). In addition,
&sect; 3756(i)(<EM>l</EM>) states expressly that "the Director
shall remove from [the Current Use
program] an entire parcel of managed forestland"
upon the happening of certain
events and that, under certain circumstances,
"the Director may delay removal
from use value appraisal." <EMU>Id</EMU>.; see also <EMU>id</EMU>.
&sect; 3756(i)(2) (providing that "Director shall
remove" property from Current Use program
upon certain occurrences). Read together,
the statutes clearly contemplate
that the Director manages the process for
removing a property from the Current Use
program. See <EMU>In re Vt. Verde Antique
Int'l, Inc.</EMU>, 174 Vt. 208, 211-12, 811 A.2d
<Page 835>
181, 184 (2002) (explaining that statutes
should be interpreted within context and
structure of entire scheme, not in isolation).
There is nothing in any of the
relevant statutes that suggests otherwise,
let alone any indication that a property is
automatically disenrolled upon a new owner
failing to comply with the terms of
&sect; 3756(e).

<P20>&para; 19. There are several reasons
why we cannot accept plaintiffs' chosen
interpretation, which effectively asks us to
add a self-executing removal provision into
these statutes. To start, we generally "will
not read something into a statute that is
not there unless it is necessary to make
the statute effective." <EMU>In re 204 N. Ave.
NOV</EMU>, 2019 VT 52, &para; 6, 210 Vt. 572, 218
A.3d 24 (quotation omitted). Automatic disenrollment
is unnecessary to effectuate
the purpose of the Current Use program
statutes because the Director of PVR has
the authority and the statutory directive to
take that action when property owners fail
to abide by the statutes' requirements.

<P20>&para; 20. Further, plaintiffs' position would
undermine the remedial purpose that the
Legislature intended for the Current Use
program to serve. See <EMU>Mollica</EMU>, 2008 VT 60,
&para; 10, 184 Vt. 83, 955 A.2d 1171 ("[T]he
legislatively established current-use program
is a remedial statute designed for
the express purpose of alleviating the tax
burden on landowners who promise to
maintain their land in agricultural or forest
use."). Plaintiffs' interpretation would lead
to a draconian system that unfairly penalizes
landowners without affording any opportunity
to remedy procedural issues.
There is nothing in the statutory scheme
indicating that the Legislature intended
such a rigid approach. Rather, the statutes
suggest the exact opposite. See 32 V.S.A.
&sect; 3751 (providing that purpose of statute
is, inter alia, "to encourage and assist the
maintenance of Vermont's productive agricultural
land and forestland ... and to
enable the citizens of Vermont to plan its
orderly growth in the face of increasing
development pressures in the interests of
the public health, safety, and welfare").

<P20>&para; 21. Accordingly, a property that
has been transferred to a new owner is not
automatically disenrolled from the Current
Use program when that new owner fails to
submit an application and pay the applicable
fee within the thirty-day statutory
deadline. Instead, disenrollment occurs
only upon the Director of PVR removing
the property from the Current Use program
using the established process. For
these reasons, we conclude that there is no
genuine dispute that the property was still
enrolled in the Current Use program when
plaintiffs started cutting trees.

<P20>&para; 22. Plaintiffs also claim that
their tree cutting on the property was not
"development" as the term is defined in
&sect; 3752(5). See generally 32 V.S.A. &sect; 3757
(providing for tax consequences where
owner engages in development of property).
According to plaintiffs, their tree-cutting
activities were exempted from "development"
under &sect; 3752(5)(E). We are
unpersuaded.

<P20>&para; 23. Under &sect; 3752(5)(C), "development"
is defined, in part, as "the cutting of timber
on property appraised under this chapter
at use value in a manner contrary to a
forest or conservation management plan as
provided for in subsection 3755(b) of this
title during the remaining term of the
plan." The statute does, however, except
some activity from the definition of "development."
Relevant here, development
"does not include the construction, reconstruction,
structural alteration, relocation,
or enlargement of any building, road, or
other structure for farming, logging, forestry,
or conservation purposes." <EMU>Id</EMU>.
&sect; 3752(5)(E).
<Page 836>

<P20>&para; 24. Plaintiffs argue that their
tree cutting fell under this exception because
it was done for the purpose of utilizing
the property for agricultural use.
However, the statute expressly limits the
exemption to "the construction, reconstruction,
structural alteration, relocation,
or enlargement <EMU>of any building, road, or
other structure</EMU>." <EMU>Id</EMU>. &sect; 3752(5)(E) (emphasis
added). Although these terms are not
defined, the language unambiguously confines
the exemption to construction and
alteration of <EMU>structures</EMU>. See <EMU>In re Tyler
Self-Storage Unit Permits</EMU>, 2011 VT 66,
&para; 8, 190 Vt. 132, 27 A.3d 1071 (explaining
that general terms followed by series of
specific terms are interpreted to apply
only to items of the same class as those
specifically mentioned). Tree cutting, by
itself, is plainly not the construction or
alteration of a structure. In reading
&sect; 3752(5)(E), it is clear that the Legislature
intended to exempt from "development"
the construction, reconstruction, alteration,
relocation, or enlargement of any
structure that furthers the approved purpose
for which a property is enrolled in
the Current Use program. See <EMU>Mollica</EMU>,
2008 VT 60, &para;&para; 17-18, 184 Vt. 83, 955 A.2d
1171 (concluding that seasonal cottage on
Christmas tree farm was farm building
rather than development and therefore eligible
for enrollment in Current Use program
because primary use was agricultural
to serve farm's operations). In other
words, cutting trees may not constitute
development under &sect; 3752(5)(E) if the primary
basis for doing so is to build a structure
that would serve the purpose for
which the property is enrolled in the Current
Use program. See <EMU>id</EMU>. In this case,
there is no dispute that at the time of the
tree cutting, the property was enrolled in
the Current Use program as managed forestland
subject to an approved forest management
plan; the property was not enrolled
as agricultural land.<fnr5> Thus,
&sect; 3752(5)(E) does not apply.

<P20>&para; 25. Our conclusion is buttressed by the
practical considerations were we to hold
otherwise. While plaintiffs here might have
hoped to use the property for agricultural
purposes, interpreting &sect; 3752(5)(E) to encompass
any activity associated with land
use would create a nearly limitless set of
exempt activities. As a result, any owner
could effectively violate the terms of an
operative management plan that governs a
property's enrollment in the Current Use
program by using the property for "farming,
logging, forestry, or conservation purposes,"
even if that unapproved use does
not fall within the purpose for which the
property is enrolled. <EMU>Id</EMU>. Such an outcome
would create an untenable situation where
"the exception would literally swallow the
rule." <EMU>C&S Wholesale Grocers, Inc. v.</EMU>

<EMU>Dep't of Taxes</EMU>, 2016 VT 77A, &para; 17, 203 Vt.
183, 155 A.3d 169.

<P20><EMU>Affirmed</EMU>.
<FN>
<fnt1> Because plaintiffs did not file a response to
FPR's statement of undisputed material facts,
the trial court deemed those facts to have
been admitted for purposes of the cross-motions
for summary judgment. See V.R.C.P.
56(e)(2). On appeal, plaintiffs do not challenge
that aspect of the court's decision in
rendering summary judgment for FPR.

<fnt2> Plaintiffs filed a new property survey with
the Town of Jericho in March 2022, showing
a total parcel area of 32.02 acres, correcting
the previously recorded total parcel area of
32.31 acres.

<fnt3> Plaintiffs explain in their brief that they
decided against submitting the required application
and statutory fee to continue enrollment
as an effort to have the property administratively
disenrolled from the Current Use
program.

<fnt4> While upholding the report, the Commissioner
revised the amount of property affected
from 30.31 acres to twenty-five acres.

<fnt5> We are unpersuaded by plaintiffs' suggestion
that the AAFM's determination approving
the property for farm use in December 2021
is relevant for assessing whether the tree-cutting
fell under &sect; 3752(5)(E). Viewing the
uncontroverted evidence in the light most favorable
to plaintiffs, there is no dispute that
an AAFM farm determination does not affect
a property's status in the Current Use program.
More specifically, plaintiffs do not argue
that the AAFM's determination converted
the property's enrollment in the Current Use
program from managed forestland to agricultural
land. The undisputed facts establish that
PVR will only change a property's enrollment
in the Current Use program from forestland
to agricultural land when the county forester
notifies PVR that conversion is complete upon
approval of an amended management plan,
and that plaintiffs knew of PVR's conversion
requirements before they began cutting trees.
Plaintiffs failed to begin the conversion process
until January 2022, two months after
they began cutting trees. Even if AAFM's determination
were relevant, it is undisputed
that AAFM did not issue the determination
until December 2021, approximately one
month after plaintiffs started cutting trees on
the property.

<P20>&para; 1. This case tasks us with determining
whether the trial court properly granted
summary judgment to defendant Burlington
School District after determining that
plaintiff American Environmental, Inc.'s
claim was moot. Because we elect to take
judicial notice of the completion of the
demolition work undergirding the bidding
process at issue in this case, we dismiss
this appeal as moot.

<P20>&para; 2. The following facts are derived from
the trial court's findings in its order granting
summary judgment to the District.
Burlington High School was closed in September
2020 after various toxic substances
were detected in several of its facilities.
Students were temporarily relocated to a
renovated building downtown while the
contaminated high school building was demolished,
the soil remediated, and a new
building constructed in its place. In September
2022, the Burlington School District
sent a Request for Qualifications outlining
the first phase of the project to
fifteen contractors, including plaintiff, and
the ultimate winner of the disputed contract,
EnviroVantage. Section 559 of Title
16 governs the procedure for soliciting
bids for a public project where, as here,
the cost is expected to surpass $500,000.
The establishment of prequalification requirements
is described as such:

<B42>(1) The State Board shall establish, in
consultation with the Commissioner of
Buildings and General Services and with
other knowledgeable sources, general
rules for the prequalification of bidders
on such a contract. The Department of
Buildings and General Services, upon
notice by the Secretary, shall provide to
school boards undergoing construction
projects suggestions and recommendations
on bidders qualified to provide construction
services.

<B42>(2) At least 60 days prior to the proposed
bid opening on any construction
contract to be awarded by a school
board that exceeds $500,000.00, the
school board shall publicly advertise for
contractors interested in bidding on the
project. The advertisement shall indicate
that the school board has established
prequalification criteria that a contractor
must meet and shall invite any interested
contractor to apply to the school
board for prequalification. All interested
contractors shall submit their qualifications
to the school board, which shall
determine a list of eligible prospective
bidders based on the previously established
criteria. At least 30 days prior to
the proposed bid opening, the school
board shall give written notice of the
board's determination to each contractor
that submitted qualifications. The school
board shall consider all bids submitted
by prequalified bidders meeting the
deadline.

<P00>16 V.S.A. &sect; 559(b).<fnr*> The statute directs
that the contract shall be awarded "to the
lowest responsible bid conforming to specifications."
<EMU>Id</EMU>. &sect; 559(c)(2). It also provides
that a "board shall have the right to reject
any bid found not to be responsible or
conforming to specifications or to reject all
bids." <EMU>Id</EMU>. Section 559(e) specifies that
<Page 840>
"[a]ny contract entered into or purchase
made in violation of the provisions of this
section shall be void."

<P20>&para; 3. The District provided the contractors
with eleven prequalification criteria
and noted that it "reserve[d] the right to
reject any and all submitted Pre-Qualifications,
to readvertise, and to waive any
and/or all informalities." Five of the fifteen
contractors responded, including plaintiff
and EnviroVantage. As relevant here, the
following was included among the prequalification
criteria:

<B42>1. Experience in successfully completing
hazardous materials abatement and
demolition projects ranging from buildings
75k-300k SF in size and projects
ranging from $5 to $20 million in cost.

<B44>...

<B42>9. The contractor has no previous citations
for noncompliance with federal or
state regulations pertaining to worker
protection, removal, transport, or disposal
related to PCBs or other hazardous
materials.

<P00>In order to be prequalified to bid, contractors
were required to submit documentation
with proof of meeting the above requirements
and to provide "five (5) sample
project examples from the past three years
demonstrating compliance with the qualification
criteria." On October 6, 2022, the
School Board voted to approve those five
contractors as prequalified and entitled to
bid on the project. Bidding instructions
were issued in early November with the
caveat that the District "reserve[d] the
right to reject any and all Bids (sic), to
waive any and all informalities not involving
price, time or changes in the work." Of
the five bids submitted, EnviroVantage's
was the lowest at $11,439,895 and plaintiff's
was the second lowest at $11,711,000.
The School Board subsequently awarded
the contract to EnviroVantage by a unanimous
vote.

<P20>&para; 4. Plaintiff submitted a formal bid
protest on December 22, claiming that
EnviroVantage was not a responsible or
qualified bidder and requesting that the
contract be awarded to plaintiff. Plaintiff
additionally filed a Vermont Rule of Civil
Procedure 75 complaint on January 6 and
petitioned the trial court for a preliminary
injunction. In denying the requested preliminary
injunction, the trial court considered
the likelihood of plaintiff's success on
the merits, determining that the claim
may or may not be untimely, or barred
by laches or a lack of standing. In balancing
the likelihood of harm and interests of
the public, the court determined that
granting the injunction would cause the
District to be liable for additional costs of
around $700,000 a month, and that the
construction delay would not be in the
best interests of the public. In coming to
its conclusion, the court succinctly noted,
"the interest in enforcing the statutory
bidding process is heavily outweighed by
the financial impacts of any delay upon
the District and taxpayers."

<P20>&para; 5. The parties then each moved for
summary judgment, with plaintiff arguing
that, had the bidding criteria been adhered
to, the contract should have been awarded
to it, and the District arguing that the case
was moot because the project was substantially
complete. Plaintiff did not respond to
the District's argument that the case was
moot. The trial court ultimately granted
summary judgment to the District. In doing
so, it relied on the New York case
<EMU>Citineighbors Coalition of Historic Carnegie
Hill ex rel. Kazickas v. New York City
Landmarks Preservation Commission</EMU>, 2
N.Y.3d 727, 778 N.Y.S.2d 740, 811 N.E.2d
2 (2004). In <EMU>Citineighbors</EMU>, the New York
Court of Appeals elaborated on the factors
relevant to whether a construction project
is "substantially complete" for mootness
purposes. <EMU>Id</EMU>., 778 N.Y.S.2d 740, 811
<Page 841>
N.E.2d at 4. These factors included "how
far the work has progressed toward completion[,]"
the "challenger's failure to seek
preliminary injunctive relief or otherwise
preserve the status quo[,]" and "whether
work was undertaken without authority or
in bad faith." <EMU>Id</EMU>. (quotation omitted).

<P20>&para; 6. The trial court applied these factors
and determined that construction was substantially
completed, that no relief could be
granted, and that plaintiff's claim was
moot. The court determined that because
plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction,
that factor weighed in plaintiff's favor.
However, the court also determined that
the project was "substantially (or possibly
wholly) complete[,]" foreclosing on any effective
relief which the court could offer
plaintiff. It disagreed with plaintiff's assertion
that remedies such as contract reassignment
or lost-profit damages were
available pursuant to the statute or Rule
75, and further determined that to pronounce
the current contract void would be
"so costly as to be beyond serious contemplation."
(quoting 13C C. Wright et al.,
Fed. Prac. & Proc. (Wright & Miller)
&sect; 3533.3.1 (3d ed. 2024)). In other words,
because the project was at such an advanced
stage, the costs of voiding the contract
and reopening bidding would vastly
outweigh any potential relief accorded to
plaintiff. Thus, after a determination that
the case presented no "actual or justiciable
controversy[,]" the trial court granted
summary judgment to the District. Plaintiff
subsequently filed this timely appeal.

<P20>&para; 7. On appeal, plaintiff presents several
arguments as to why the trial court erred
in granting summary judgment to the District
on mootness grounds. Plaintiff argues
that the trial court erred in determining
the case was moot without evidence showing
the project was wholly complete.
Plaintiff further argues that the trial court
erred in finding the project was not undertaken
without authority or in bad faith,
pointing to the District's alleged lack of
authority in awarding the contract and
concealment of evidence. Plaintiff also argues
that its attempt to preserve the status
quo through seeking a preliminary injunction
prevents its claim from being
rendered moot. Finally, plaintiff argues
that its asserted injuries are redressable,
and that even if moot, its claim meets the
exception for injuries which are capable of
repetition yet evade review. Because we
dismiss this appeal as moot, we consider
plaintiff's argument that this matter survives
mootness based on that exception
and do not reach plaintiff's additional arguments.

<P20>&para; 8. As a preliminary matter, we
take judicial notice of the total completion
of demolition and remediation work constituting
the basis of plaintiff's claim. Vermont
Rule of Evidence 201 allows this
Court "whether requested or not" to take
judicial notice of any adjudicative fact
which is "not subject to reasonable dispute
in that it is either (1) generally known
within the territorial jurisdiction of the
trial court or (2) capable of accurate and
ready determination by resort to sources
whose accuracy cannot reasonably be
questioned." V.R.E. 201(b)-(c). A court
may take judicial notice of mootness and
an "event that causes a case to be moot
may be proved by extrinsic evidence out-side
the record." <EMU>State ex rel. Nelson v.
Russo</EMU>, 89 Ohio St.3d 227, 729 N.E.2d 1181,
1182 (2000) (quotation omitted). "Judicial
notice is premised on the concept that
certain facts or propositions exist which a
court may accept as true without requiring
additional proof from the opposing parties."
<EMU>In re A.M.</EMU>, 2015 VT 109, &para; 30, 200
Vt. 189, 130 A.3d 211 (quotation omitted).
An adjudicative fact is a "proposition[]
pertaining to the particular events which
give rise to the lawsuit." Reporter's Notes,
<Page 842>
V.R.E. 201. Here, there is no dispute that
the status of the demolition and remediation
work "bear on" the merits of this case.
See <EMU>Commonwealth v. Hilaire</EMU>, 92 Mass.
App.Ct. 784, 95 N.E.3d 278, 283 n.5 (2018)
("The demographic data at issue here are
adjudicatory facts because they bear on
the identification of the defendant as one
of the perpetrators of the home invasion.").

<P20>&para; 9. Additionally, here, completion of the
demolition and remediation work is "capable
of accurate and ready determination by
resort to sources whose accuracy cannot
reasonably be questioned," V.R.E. 201,
namely the "highly visible construction
work ... underway at the site." <EMU>Citineighbors</EMU>,
778 N.Y.S.2d 740, 811 N.E.2d at 3.
On April 19, 2024, the District issued a
press release stating "[d]emolition of the
old campus is complete" and that "EnviroVantage
has turned 100% of the area over
to Whiting-Turner[,]" the building contractor.
Burlington School District, BHS/BTC
Project Updates (Apr. 19, 2024), https://www.bsdvt.org/2024/04/19/bhs-btc-update-april-19-demolition-complete-value-engineering-saves-3-9m/
[https://perma.cc/7JLK-QS69].
A timelapse video located on
the District's website shows not only the
completion of the demolition and soil
remediation, but also depicts the erection
of a steel frame on the site of the old
school beginning in late April 2024. Additional
photos and videos uploaded after the
case was argued depict continued progress
in the construction of several buildings
that will make up the campus, including
the gymnasium, auditorium, and a courtyard.
Finally, when questioned at oral argument,
counsel for plaintiff stated he was
not aware of the status of the demolition
work, while counsel for the District noted
it was 100% complete.

<P20>&para; 10. The Appellate Court of Illinois for
the Second District similarly took judicial
notice of a completed construction project
in <EMU>Harry W. Kuhn, Inc. v. County of Du
Page</EMU>, 203 Ill.App.3d 677, 149 Ill.Dec. 180,
561 N.E.2d 458 (1990). There, the defendant
county appealed a lower court's
granting of mandamus to the plaintiff, directing
the defendant to issue a permit
allowing the plaintiff to operate a temporary
cement batching plant for the duration
of a construction contract to which the
plaintiff was a party. <EMU>Id</EMU>., 149 Ill.Dec. 180,
561 N.E.2d at 459. In reliance on extrinsic
evidence in the form of a letter from the
county development committee and affidavit
of the plaintiff indicating the construction
was complete, the court took judicial
notice of the project's completion and dismissed
the case as moot. <EMU>Id</EMU>., 149 Ill.Dec.
180, 561 N.E.2d at 463-64. The Court of
Appeals for the First District of California
likewise took judicial notice of a construction
project's completion based on various
extrinsic documents the defendant city
filed verifying completion. <EMU>Wilson & Wilson
v. City Council of Redwood City</EMU>, 191
Cal.App.4th 1559, 120 Cal. Rptr. 3d 665,
676 (2011). The court ultimately dismissed
the appeal as moot, noting that while the
plaintiff's challenge "may have presented a
ripe controversy at its inception, the status
of the case changed once the Project was
substantially completed." <EMU>Id</EMU>. at 687. In this
case, the documentation and visual certainty
provided by the photos and videos that
demolition is complete render this fact
proper for the taking of judicial notice.

<P20>&para; 11. "It is well-settled that this
Court has jurisdiction to decide only `actual
controversies arising between adverse
litigants, duly instituted in courts of proper
jurisdiction.'" <EMU>Chase v. State</EMU>, 2008 VT 107,
&para; 11, 184 Vt. 430, 966 A.2d 139 (quoting <EMU>In
re Constitutionality of House Bill 88</EMU>, 115
Vt. 524, 529, 64 A.2d 169, 172 (1949)). "In
order for this Court to have jurisdiction
over an appeal, it must present a live
controversy <EMU>at all stages of the appeal</EMU>, and
<Page 843>
the parties must have a `legally cognizable
interest in the outcome.'" <EMU>Id</EMU>. (quoting <EMU>Doria
v. Univ. of Vt.</EMU>, 156 Vt. 114, 117, 589
A.2d 317, 319 (1991)). Thus, "[e]ven though
there was once an actual controversy, a
change in the facts can render an issue or
entire case moot." <EMU>In re Moriarty</EMU>, 156 Vt.
160, 163, 588 A.2d 1063, 1064 (1991). An
issue becomes moot where "the reviewing
court can no longer grant effective relief."
<EMU>Id</EMU>. (quotation omitted). Here, because the
only available relief to plaintiff pursuant to
Rule 75 was precluded with the completion
of the contract work, this appeal presents
no live controversy between the parties,
and must be dismissed.

<P20>&para; 12. Plaintiff maintains that its appeal
survives mootness because avenues for redressability
still include injunctive relief
and lost-profit damages. Here, because the
work underlying the contract is complete,
an injunction would provide no actual relief
to plaintiff. See <EMU>Houston v. Town of Waitsfield</EMU>,
2007 VT 135, &para; 12, 183 Vt. 543, 944
A.2d 260 (mem.) ("Because the [project] is
complete and cannot be undone, this Court
can no longer grant the injunctive relief
that landowners originally sought and the
case is moot."). Plaintiff's reliance on the
Massachusetts case <EMU>Bradford & Bigelow,
Inc. v. Commonwealth</EMU>, 24 Mass.App.Ct.
349, 509 N.E.2d 30, 35 (1987), is equally
unavailing as, unlike Vermont, "[i]t is well
established [in Massachusetts] that a bidder
on a contract governed by G.L. c. 149,
&sect;&sect; 44A-44L has standing to challenge the
compliance of the awarding authority with
the requirements of those sections." <EMU>Quincy
Ornamental Iron Works, Inc. v. Findlen</EMU>,
353 Mass. 85, 228 N.E.2d 453, 455
(1967).

<P20>&para; 13. Plaintiff additionally posits that it
is entitled to lost-profit damages; however,
the Reporter's Notes to Rule 75 confirm
that damages are unavailable pursuant to
that rule, allowing liberal amendment of
"erroneously" filed Rule 75 complaints "to
claim any form of ordinary civil relief, such
as ... damages." Reporter's Notes,
V.R.C.P. 75. This makes sense when considering
that "the relief available under
Rule 75 represents the modern equivalent
of extraordinary relief by mandamus or
certiorari," having the primary purpose of
mandating action by public officials or settling
questions of law. <EMU>Ahern v. Mackey</EMU>,
2007 VT 27, &para; 8, 181 Vt. 599, 925 A.2d 1011
(mem.) (quotation omitted). Because plaintiff
cannot recover money damages pursuant
to Rule 75 and injunctive relief would
be strictly illusory, this Court "can no
longer grant effective relief." See <EMU>Moriarty</EMU>,
156 Vt. at 163, 588 A.2d at 1064.

<P20>&para; 14. Plaintiff also asserts that,
should this Court determine its appeal is
moot, we should apply the mootness exception
for cases which are capable of repetition,
yet evade review. In order to meet
this exception, the following conditions
must be met: "(1) the challenged action
must be in its duration too short to be fully
litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,
and (2) there must be a reasonable
expectation that the same complaining party
will be subjected to the same action
again." <EMU>In re Blue Cross & Blue Shield</EMU>,
2022 VT 53, &para; 9, 217 Vt. 285, 288 A.3d 160
(quotation omitted) (brackets omitted). In
considering the first factor, we examine
whether the complaining party would have
the opportunity to effectively challenge the
action in the future. <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 10. "If a litigant
could have taken actions to expedite the
appellate process but did not, the matter
does not fit within this exception." <EMU>Id</EMU>.
(quotation omitted). Here, plaintiff waited
approximately three months to file its action
with the superior court and an additional
two weeks before requesting injunctive
relief. Further, plaintiff declined to
seek an interlocutory appeal of the court's
<Page 844>
denial of its preliminary injunction, failing
to "expedite the appellate process." See <EMU>id</EMU>.

<P20>&para; 15. In evaluating the second
factor, plaintiff "must show that it is more
than just `theoretically possible' that the
situation he currently objects to will repeat
itself; rather, he must show a `demonstrated
probability' that he will become embroiled
again in this same situation." <EMU>Paige
v. State</EMU>, 2017 VT 54, &para; 13, 205 Vt. 287, 171
A.3d 1011 (quotations omitted). Here,
plaintiff's bare contention that "where other
school construction projects are contemplated
in Vermont" and "where AEI is
licensed to perform such work in Vermont,
it intends to continue bidding on such projects"
falls well short of the "demonstrated
probability" required to show plaintiff will
be subject to the same circumstances for
the purposes of this exception. While it is
"theoretically possible" that plaintiff may
encounter this situation again, this assertion,
without more, makes it no more or
less likely.

<P20>&para; 16. This outcome is bolstered by our
decision in <EMU>In re Green Mountain Power
Corp.</EMU>, where Green Mountain Power challenged
a Department of Public Service ruling
regarding a set of complex interrelated
transactions known as "lease-backs." 148
Vt. 333, 334, 532 A.2d 582, 583 (1987).
Although the Court determined the appeal
was moot based on the finalization of the
transactions, Green Mountain Power argued
the case was capable of repetition
because "lease-back" transactions were becoming
much more prevalent. <EMU>Id</EMU>. at 335,
532 A.2d at 584. The Court disagreed,
noting that "[Green Mountain Power] has
presented no evidence that it is currently
contemplating any projects that would require
... approval under comparable circumstances"
and "merely advanced the
hypothetical possibility that it will." <EMU>Id</EMU>. at
335-36, 532 A.2d at 584. Similarly, plaintiff
here has made no showing beyond bare
and conclusory allegations that its intention
to bid on further public projects will
necessarily result in a repetition of plaintiff's
current circumstances.

<P20>&para; 17. Because we take judicial notice of
the completion of the demolition and
remediation work underlying the contract
at issue, and because such completion
leaves plaintiff with no effective remedy
which this Court can provide, we dismiss
the appeal as moot.

<P20><EMU>Dismissed</EMU>.

<P20>&para; 1. Mother moved to set aside a family
division order terminating her parental
rights in her daughter G.L.<fnr1> She sought
relief from the December 2021 judgment
on several grounds, including an allegation
that the Department for Children and
Families (DCF) perpetrated fraud on the
court in connection with certain information
about G.L.'s long-term, preadoptive
foster parents. The trial court denied
mother's motion, and, on appeal, she argues
that it erred in: (1) excluding evidence
she offered in support of alternative
arguments for relief; (2) denying her motion
to reopen the evidence; and (3) concluding
that DCF did not engage in fraud
on the court. We affirm.

<P20>&para; 2. The following facts are drawn from
the record and the unchallenged findings
in the order on appeal. G.L. was born in
April 2019. In September of the same year,
the State filed a petition seeking a determination
that she was a child in need of
care or supervision (CHINS). The supporting
affidavit alleged that G.L.'s older half-brother
arrived at school with a significant
facial injury and reported that mother
struck him. The family division transferred
custody of five-month-old G.L. to DCF,
and the agency placed her in the home of
foster parents N.G. and R.G. G.L. has
lived with N.G. and R.G. continuously
since that time.

<P20>&para; 3. Mother and father stipulated that
G.L. was CHINS at the time of the State's
petition because her half-brother sustained
unexplained injuries while in their care
and violence in the household had previously
interfered with the family's home
life. In July 2020, the trial court adopted a
disposition case plan calling for mother to,
among other things, work with psychiatry,
<Page 850>
medication-management, and counseling
providers to address her aggressive behavior
toward others and attend all scheduled
visits with G.L.

<P20>&para; 4. The State filed a petition to terminate
parents' rights in G.L. in March 2021.
Mother was represented by Attorney Paul
Groce, and the State was represented by
Assistant Attorney General Wendy Burroughs.
Attorney Groce requested discovery
of "the DCF file [o]n [G.L.]," and
Attorney Burroughs responded that he
could inspect and photocopy it at DCF's
district office in St. Albans. The file Attorney
Groce reviewed there appeared to him
to be complete. It did not contain records
from the DCF Residential Licensing and
Special Investigations Unit (RLSI), which
is responsible for licensing foster homes.
As a matter of course, RLSI stores its
records at DCF's central office in Waterbury,
not within the juvenile files maintained
by DCF's district offices. Among
RLSI's files were records pertaining to
N.G. and R.G., including their prior licensing
applications dating back to 2008 and
documentation of two investigations conducted
by RLSI in 2011. One of these
investigations was prompted by an allegation
that a child in N.G.'s care took Percocet
pills after being left unsupervised with
access to the medication.<fnr2>

<P20>&para; 5. The family division held a contested
hearing on the State's termination petition
in October and November 2021. During
the first day of the hearing, mother testified
that she told an unidentified DCF
worker she thought N.G.'s feet resembled
those of a drug user, and the worker responded
by attributing their appearance to
N.G.'s health issues. Attorney Groce
learned of this for the first time when he
heard his client's testimony. However, he
did not investigate the allegation further
or pursue it during his examination of
either mother or N.G.

<P20>&para; 6. The DCF worker assigned to G.L.'s
case also testified at the termination hearing.
At the time, she had been involved in
the case for only two months. She explained
that she had observed G.L. in her
foster home and that DCF had no concerns
about the ability of N.G. and R.G. to
meet G.L.'s needs.

<P20>&para; 7. On December 22, 2021, the family
division issued a written order terminating
parents' rights in G.L.<fnr3> It found that
mother continued to demonstrate volatile
behavior in her interactions with others,
including in G.L.'s presence, and was either
unwilling or unable to maintain consistent
contact with G.L., frequently missing
their scheduled visits. The court
therefore concluded that mother had stagnated
in her progress toward the case-plan
goals and considered whether it was
in G.L.'s best interests to terminate parental
rights under the factors set forth at
33 V.S.A. &sect; 5114(a). It determined that
the most important of these&mdash;the parents'
ability to resume or assume parental
duties within a reasonable time from the
perspective of G.L.&mdash;weighed in favor of
termination. Though G.L. had been in
<Page 851>
DCF custody for over twenty-five months,
it was still uncertain when mother would
be able to resume parenting given her
lack of consistent contact with G.L., ongoing
struggle to regulate her emotions in
interpersonal relationships or appreciate
the impact of this behavior on G.L., and
the "substantial work" that remained for
mother to demonstrate the skills necessary
to effectively parent. Relative to the
other &sect; 5114(a) factors, among other
things, the court noted that G.L. had
strong bonds with N.G. and R.G., who
provided her with consistency and stability,
met her needs, and hoped to adopt her
if she was freed for adoption.

<P20>&para; 8. Mother appealed the termination
order to this Court, where DCF was represented
by Assistant Attorney General
Julianne Woolard. In the spring of 2022,
while the appeal was pending, RLSI was
tasked with performing a relicensing investigation
for N.G. and R.G. in anticipation
of possible adoption proceedings and
because their three-year foster license was
nearing its expiration date. DCF had recently
learned that R.G. had a prescription
for the substance-use-disorder treatment
medication Suboxone. R.G.'s physician informed
DCF that R.G. was doing very well
in treatment, and RLSI did not perceive
any related safety risk to G.L. However,
the licensing unit sought more specific information
on this subject, including R.G.'s
urinalysis results.

<P20>&para; 9. On June 17, 2022, while the RLSI
investigation was ongoing, a three-Justice
panel of this Court affirmed the termination
order. See <EMU>In re G.L.</EMU>, No. 22-AP-004,
2022 WL 2189545 (Vt. June 17, 2022)
[https://perma.cc/SGL8-5WWE], <EMU>cert. denied</EMU>,
___ U.S. ___, 143 S. Ct. 811, 215
L.Ed.2d 67 (2023). By late July, R.G. had
yet to sign an unlimited release to allow
DCF access to his urinalysis results. He
also asked what would happen if his results
were not all negative. Though RLSI
does not automatically deny relicensing applications
solely because of substance use
in a household, R.G.'s question and his
reluctance to sign the release raised "red
flags." However, DCF ultimately obtained
R.G.'s urinalysis results and, as late as
August 2022, was still contemplating
granting the licensing renewal.

<P20>&para; 10. RLSI ultimately discovered that in
prior relicensing applications, N.G. and
R.G. failed to disclose R.G.'s history with
alcohol and related relapse or his ongoing
substance-use-disorder treatment. By the
end of August, RLSI formulated support
to deny the pending application based on
the foster parents' pattern of omission and
nondisclosure over the years and warned
the district office of the possible need to
remove G.L. from their household. RLSI
issued its decision denying the relicensing
application on September 2, 2022. There
was no evidence that R.G.'s alcohol use or
substance-use-disorder treatment impacted
G.L.; instead, RLSI's decision was
based on the family's lack of transparency
with DCF about these issues.

<P20>&para; 11. As a result of RLSI's nonrenewal,
DCF determined that it would no longer
be possible for N.G. and R.G. to adopt G.L.
and began making plans to identify and
move her to a placement that could offer
permanency. In response, G.L.'s attorney
requested that the court issue an order
placing her in the conditional custody of
N.G., with a long-term goal of establishing
permanent guardianship. At a hearing on
the motion, DCF indicated that it did not
believe a permanent guardianship was possible
because parents' rights had been terminated.
Noting that the assigned DCF
worker had no immediate concerns for
G.L.'s safety in her current placement, the
court issued a conditional custody order
allowing her to remain in the home of N.G.
<Page 852>
and R.G. while DCF explored other options.

<P20>&para; 12. Mother and father were removed
as parties to the family division proceedings
after the termination order was affirmed.
However, at some point, DCF inadvertently
sent one or more documents to
Attorney Groce disclosing the agency's
concerns about the foster family and attendant
change in position regarding adoption.
In January 2023, prompted by this
discovery, mother filed a motion for relief
from the termination order under 33
V.S.A. &sect; 5113(b) or, in the alternative,
&sect; 5113(a) and Vermont Rule of Civil Procedure
60(b).

<P20>&para; 13. Section 5113 "delineates when
an existing order in a child-neglect proceeding
may be modified." <EMU>In re A.W.</EMU>,
2013 VT 107, &para; 4, 195 Vt. 226, 87 A.3d 508.
Under 33 V.S.A. &sect; 5113(b), the family court
"may amend, modify, set aside, or vacate
an order on the grounds that a change in
circumstances requires such action to
serve the best interests of the child."
Mother asserted that the court should set
aside the termination order under this provision
because there had been a change in
circumstances warranting consideration of
whether it was in G.L.'s best interests to
reinstate mother's rights to pursue reunification
or, in the alternative, facilitate G.L.
being placed under the permanent guardianship
of N.G. and R.G. Section 5113(a),
on the other hand, provides that a family
division order may be set aside in accordance
with Civil Rule 60, which permits
courts to relieve a party from an order for
one of six enumerated reasons: (1) mistake,
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable
neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence; (3)
fraud; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the
judgment has been satisfied or released; or
(6) "any other reason justifying relief from
the operation of the judgment." V.R.C.P.
60(b); 33 V.S.A. &sect; 5113(a). Rule 60(b)(6),
the "so-called catchall provision, ... allows
the trial court to relieve a party from a
final judgment for any reason beside those
set forth in the first five sections of the
rule"&mdash;including fraud on the court. <EMU>Hill v.
Springfield Hosp.</EMU>, 2023 VT 23, &para; 20, 218
Vt. 64, 297 A.3d 504; <EMU>Godin v. Godin</EMU>, 168
Vt. 514, 517-18, 725 A.2d 904, 907 (1998).
Mother alternatively argued that the termination
order should be set aside under
&sect; 5113(a) and Rule 60(b)(6) because DCF
may have engaged in fraud on the court by
withholding information about G.L.'s foster
home or because relief was otherwise justified
by the circumstances of the case.<fnr4>

<P20>&para; 14. At a preliminary hearing on March
8, 2023, the family division indicated that it
believed mother was limited to her fraud-on-the-court
theory because this Court has
held that &sect; 5113(b) does not apply to orders
terminating parental rights. However,
it reserved judgment on this point and
permitted mother to file a supplemental
memorandum of law in support of her
alternative theories of relief. Mother filed
her memorandum on this issue on March
20. She acknowledged our precedent holding
that &sect; 5113(b) does not apply to termination
orders and did not press her argument
under that provision. However, she
maintained that the court could nonetheless
consider, under &sect; 5113(a) and Rule
60(b)(6), whether vacating the termination
order was in G.L.'s best interests given a
change in circumstances.
<Page 853>

<P20>&para; 15. The next hearing was held shortly
after mother filed her supplemental memorandum.
The court indicated that it had
not yet had an opportunity to review the
filings in depth given the parties' extensive
motion practice during the preceding
week. The parties instead discussed the
judge's upcoming transition to another
courthouse and several outstanding discovery
issues, and the court ordered mother
to file an amended motion setting forth her
fraud-on-the-court claim with greater particularity
following the completion of discovery.

<P20>&para; 16. Mother filed the amended motion
relative to her fraud-on-the-court claim on
April 28. She presented a multifaceted theory,
arguing that DCF engaged in fraud
on the court by either knowingly or recklessly:
storing RLSI records in a manner
that frustrated parents' efforts to obtain
information about foster homes pertinent
to termination proceedings; offering false
evidence, through the DCF worker, that
G.L.'s foster home was suitable during the
hearing on the State's termination petition;
failing to disclose the existence of negative
information about N.G. and R.G. in response
to mother's discovery request, to
the family division, or to this Court during
the appeal; and neglecting to raise its concerns
with the family division until after
parents were no longer parties to the case.

<P20>&para; 17. A second judge held an evidentiary
hearing on mother's motion over five days
between May and October of 2023. The
court excluded certain evidence mother
sought to offer in support of her argument
that changed circumstances warranted reconsideration
of whether it was in G.L.'s
best interests to reinstate mother's rights.
The court held that this evidence was inadmissible
under the law-of-the-case doctrine
because the first judge concluded that
mother was limited to her fraud-on-the-court
claim as a matter of law. It also
denied mother's post-hearing motion to reopen
the evidence.

<P20>&para; 18. In December 2023, the family division
issued a written decision including the
following factual findings. DCF's practice
of storing RLSI records separately was
logically supported by the agency's view of
the distinct function of RLSI as compared
with DCF's district offices, as well as
DCF's understanding of the privacy laws
applicable to foster parent records, including
the federal Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act. See 42 U.S.C.
&sect; 1320d-6 (barring wrongful disclosure of
individually identifiable health information
by covered entities). The siloing of this
information was "merely a bureaucratic
choice" based on these considerations, and
"not some deliberate plan to hide relevant
information from parents" in connection
with termination proceedings.

<P20>&para; 19. Although Attorney Groce was unaware
of the RLSI records, notice of their
existence was posted on DCF's public website,
and other attorneys who represent
parents and children in termination proceedings
know that these records exist and
can seek access by requesting them, asking
that the foster parents sign releases,
or moving the court to order their disclosure.
Attorney Groce did not undertake
these efforts, even after hearing his
client's testimony regarding her observations
of N.G.'s feet at the first day of the
termination hearing. He also chose not to
question any of the witnesses about this
issue.

<P20>&para; 20. When RLSI discovered that N.G.
and R.G. failed to disclose information
about R.G.'s substance use and treatment
in prior licensing applications, it "treated
the matter as a question of relicensing and
proceeded accordingly." It did not calibrate
its investigation in relation or response
to the underlying termination proceeding.
At the time the termination order
<Page 854>
was affirmed, RLSI had not decided
whether to grant the relicensing application.
It was still attempting to obtain more
information from N.G. and R.G. Moreover,
the RLSI investigator did not become
aware of the 2011 investigation records
until August 2022, as her investigation approached
its conclusion, because relicensing
investigations usually focus on the
three-year period following the most recent
license renewal.

<P20>&para; 21. The family division found it highly
unlikely that the DCF worker knew of the
adverse information about N.G. and R.G.
in the licensing file during her testimony
at the termination hearing. The DCF
worker did not learn of DCF's concerns
about R.G.'s substance use and treatment
until late July or early August 2022, after
the termination order had been affirmed
on appeal. At that point, her focus was on
how to address the situation so that G.L.
could remain in the only home she had
ever known, given that there was no evidence
that her care was ever compromised
by R.G.'s substance-use disorder or treatment.
In fact, by the conclusion of the
hearings on mother's motion for relief
from judgment, the DCF worker indicated
that DCF once again supported G.L.'s
adoption by N.G. and R.G.

<P20>&para; 22. Attorney Burroughs was not aware
of the negative information in the RLSI
records until after the oral argument in
mother's appeal. Though she first learned
of RLSI's emerging concerns in May or
June 2022, the discussion at that point was
limited to the unit's need for more detailed
information regarding N.G. and R.G. in
connection with its relicensing investigation.
Attorney Burroughs did not know
that RLSI was leaning toward denying the
application until late July 2022. Attorney
Woolard did not learn of either the information
in the RLSI records or any circumstances
connected with the relicensing denial
until after the termination order was
affirmed on appeal. At this point, DCF
could not disclose the information because
the termination and appeal proceedings
had concluded.

<P20>&para; 23. The court rejected mother's argument
that the outcome of the termination
proceeding and subsequent appeal could
have been different if information about
the foster family had been revealed to
mother and the family division earlier.
Though the court credited Attorney
Groce's testimony that he would have explored
the issues through cross-examination
of the foster parents had he known of
them at the time of the termination hearing,
it noted that G.L.'s relationship with
her foster family and the availability of an
adoptive home were not dispositive considerations
in the termination of mother's
rights. It reasoned that even if the trial
court had heard evidence of the foster
family's dishonesty about R.G.'s drug
treatment and relapse, it would bear only
on their credibility.

<P20>&para; 24. The family division explained that
fraud on the court is found only in extraordinary
circumstances where the integrity
of the judicial process is subverted through
an unconscionable scheme or plan. It concluded,
based on the findings described
above, that mother failed to meet her burden
of proof on this point and denied her
motion to set aside the termination order.
See <EMU>Merchs. Nat'l Bank of New Bedford v.
Considine</EMU>, 135 Vt. 416, 418, 377 A.2d 1390,
1392 (1977) ("The burden of proof in a
Rule 60(b) motion is upon the moving party.").
This appeal followed.

<CN>I. Exclusion of Evidence Relevant to
Alternate Grounds for Relief

<P20>&para; 25. We begin with mother's challenge
to the court's exclusion of evidence
under the law-of-the-case doctrine. She
contends that this was error because the
<Page 855>
first judge did not expressly rule on her
alternative arguments that the termination
order could be set aside under &sect; 5113(b) or
&sect; 5113(a) and Rule 60(b)(6) because G.L.'s
circumstances had changed and it was in
her best interests to reinstate mother's
parental rights.<fnr5>

<P20>&para; 26. We review a ruling excluding
evidence for abuse of discretion, <EMU>In re
K.S.</EMU>, 2021 VT 51, &para; 31, 215 Vt. 205, 260
A.3d 387, finding reversible error only
where "a substantial right of the party is
affected." V.R.E. 103(a). As discussed
above, the record reflects that the court
invited mother to submit additional briefing
on the two arguments at issue here. In
her March 20 memorandum, mother abandoned
her &sect; 5113(b) argument, but contended
that equivalent relief was nonetheless
available under &sect; 5113(a) and Rule
60(b)(6). There is no indication that the
first judge ever issued the anticipated ruling
on this point. As a result, the law-of-the-case
doctrine was not a basis to exclude
the evidence mother offered.<fnr6> See
<EMU>Fabiano v. Cotton</EMU>, 2020 VT 85, &para; 20, 213
Vt. 236, 249 A.3d 1268 (concluding that
law-of-the-case doctrine did not bar ruling
on motion to modify following pretrial
hearing before different judge because prior
judge's statements reflected intent to
reserve decision on issue). Although the
court's reasoning was incorrect, its ruling
is not grounds for reversal. The exclusion
of evidence relative to changed circumstances
and best interests had no impact
on mother's substantial rights because
both related arguments were unavailing as
a matter of law.<fnr7>

<P20>&para; 27. As the trial court noted, we
have repeatedly held that &sect; 5113(b) is inapplicable
to termination orders. See <EMU>In re
C.L.</EMU>, 2021 VT 66, &para; 32, 215 Vt. 341, 263
A.3d 745 ("[O]ur case law clearly establishes
that &sect; 5113(b) does not apply to
termination orders."); <EMU>In re P.K.</EMU>, 2017 VT
3, &para; 15, 204 Vt. 102, 164 A.3d 665 ("[W]e
reaffirm our holding that &sect; 5113(b) does
not apply to an order terminating parental
rights." (quotation omitted)); <EMU>In re A.W.</EMU>,
2013 VT 107, &para; 13, 195 Vt. 226, 87 A.3d 508
("Because the termination order was not
subject to father's motion to modify based
on changed circumstances, the trial court
properly dismissed it."). This conclusion
stems from two closely related considerations.
First, by legislative design, an order
terminating parental rights occupies a
"unique" role in child-neglect proceedings.
<EMU>In re A.W.</EMU>, 2013 VT 107, &para; 11, 195 Vt. 226,
87 A.3d 508. "Unlike other orders" the
juvenile court may issue, "a termination
decision is a permanent order" and "must
be based on findings by clear and convincing
evidence." <EMU>Id</EMU>.; 33 V.S.A. &sect; 5231(c) (providing
that to terminate parental rights,
court must make findings by "clear and
<Page 856>
convincing evidence," while standard of
proof for "all other issues" is preponderance
of evidence); also compare, e.g., 33
V.S.A. &sect; 5308(b) ("[T]he court may issue
such <EMU>temporary</EMU> orders related to the legal
custody of the child as it deems necessary
and sufficient." (emphasis added)); <EMU>id</EMU>.
&sect; 5320a(a) (providing that "presumptive
duration" of conditional custody order
"shall be no more than six months from
the date of the disposition order or the
conditional custody order, whichever occurs
later," unless extended by court after
hearing for "additional period of time not
to exceed six months"). Second, the Legislature
has specified that the juvenile judicial
proceedings chapters must be construed
"[T]o [en]sure that safety and
timely permanency for children are the
<EMU>paramount concerns</EMU> in the administration
and conduct'" of cases filed thereunder. <EMU>In
re A.W.</EMU>, 2013 VT 107, &para; 10, 195 Vt. 226, 87
A.3d 508 (quoting 33 V.S.A. &sect; 5101(a)(4)
(emphasis added)).

<P20>&para; 28. Reading &sect; 5113(b) in light of
the Legislature's stated purpose of timely
permanency for children, and accounting
for the keystone function termination orders
play in achieving that end, we concluded
in <EMU>In re A.W.</EMU>&mdash;and reaffirmed in <EMU>In
re P.K.</EMU> and <EMU>In re C.L.</EMU>&mdash;that the provision
is inapplicable to termination orders. <EMU>In re
C.L.</EMU>, 2021 VT 66, &para; 32, 215 Vt. 341, 263
A.3d 745; <EMU>In re P.K.</EMU>, 2017 VT 3, &para; 15, 204
Vt. 102, 164 A.3d 665; <EMU>In re A.W.</EMU>, 2013 VT
107, &para; 12, 195 Vt. 226, 87 A.3d 508. As a
result, mother could not attain relief from
the termination order based on alleged
changed circumstances under &sect; 5113(b).
Considering the same principles expressed
in those cases in connection with &sect; 5113(a)
and Rule 60(b)(6), we conclude that as a
matter of law, mother could no more raise
her changed-circumstances argument under
those provisions than she could pursuant
to &sect; 5113(b).

<P20>&para; 29. Rule 60(b)(6) "is, by its
very nature, invoked to prevent hardship
or injustice," and therefore must "be liberally
construed and applied." <EMU>Cliche v.
Cliche</EMU>, 143 Vt. 301, 306, 466 A.2d 314, 316
(1983) (citing 11 C. Wright & A. Miller,
Fed. Prac. and Proc. &sect; 2864 (1973)). However,
"it is not an open invitation to reconsider
matters concluded at trial," <EMU>Penland
v. Warren</EMU>, 2018 VT 70, &para; 7, 208 Vt. 15, 194
A.3d 755 (quotation omitted); rather, it is
reserved for only those "extraordinary situations"
that "warrant the reopening of
final judgments after a substantial period
of time," <EMU>Riehle v. Tudhope</EMU>, 171 Vt. 626,
627, 765 A.2d 885, 887 (2000) (mem.). Thus,
courts have recognized only "few narrowly-defined
situations"&mdash;such as allegations
of fraud on the court&mdash;"that clearly present
`other reasons justifying relief'" under
Rule 60(b)(6). 11 C. Wright & A. Miller,
Fed. Prac. and Proc. &sect; 2864 (3d ed. 2024);
see <EMU>Godin</EMU>, 168 Vt. at 518-19, 725 A.2d at
907-08.

<P20>&para; 30. In identifying these rare
scenarios, courts are "to be guided by accepted
legal principles applied in light of
all the circumstances." <EMU>Cliche</EMU>, 143 Vt. at
307, 466 A.2d at 317. Section 5113(a), like
&sect; 5113(b), must be construed in harmony
with the other provisions of the juvenile
judicial proceedings chapters. See <EMU>In re
C.L.S.</EMU>, 2021 VT 25, &para;&para; 13-14, 214 Vt. 379,
253 A.3d 443. Though mother argues that
our holdings in <EMU>In re C.L.</EMU>, <EMU>In re P.K.</EMU>, and
<EMU>In re A.W.</EMU> do not apply to a motion filed
under &sect; 5113(a) and Rule 60(b)(6), she
fundamentally seeks the same relief those
cases foreclosed under &sect; 5113(b): the reconsideration
of whether termination of
her parental rights is in G.L.'s best interests
given an intervening change of circumstances.

<P20>&para; 31. Mother contends that this case is
different because she sought the reinstatement
of her parental rights to facilitate
<Page 857>
timely permanency for G.L. However, we
have affirmed that the twin concerns animating
our conclusion in <EMU>In re A.W.</EMU> "exist
regardless of the timing or the basis for" a
motion to set aside a termination order
under &sect; 5113(b). <EMU>In re C.L.</EMU>, 2021 VT 66,
&para; 37, 215 Vt. 341, 263 A.3d 745; see <EMU>In re
P.K.</EMU>, 2017 VT 3, &para; 17, 204 Vt. 102, 164 A.3d
665 (rejecting attempt to distinguish <EMU>In re
A.W.</EMU> on grounds that mother asserted
changed circumstances based on child's
best interests rather than improved parenting
ability and holding that reasoning of
<EMU>In re A.W.</EMU> "is generally applicable to all
termination orders, regardless of the basis
for the alleged changed circumstances").
As we explained in <EMU>In re A.W.</EMU>, "[t]here is a
time for permanence for children," and
"[i]t would indefinitely expand the termination
process and abolish the intended
permanency of a termination-of-parental-rights
order" in <EMU>all</EMU> cases "if a parent could
seek to modify the order based on changed
circumstances." 2013 VT 107, &para; 12, 195 Vt.
226, 87 A.3d 508.

<P20>&para; 32. This reasoning is no less
germane to a motion for relief from a
termination order based on changed circumstances
under Rule 60(b)(6). In fact,
there is a precise congruence between the
"particularly great" need for finality we
have recognized in termination cases, <EMU>In re
P.K.</EMU>, 2017 VT 3, &para; 13, 204 Vt. 102, 164 A.3d
665, and the requirement that, in discerning
the limits of Rule 60(b)(6) relief, "[w]e
must be concerned about the certainty and
finality of judgments so that litigation can
reach an end," <EMU>Richwagen v. Richwagen</EMU>,
153 Vt. 1, 4, 568 A.2d 419, 421 (1989).
While Rule 60(b)(6) must be liberally applied,
the "interests of finality necessarily
limit when relief is available" thereunder.
<EMU>McCleery v. Wally's World, Inc.</EMU>, 2007 VT
140, &para; 10, 183 Vt. 549, 945 A.2d 841 (mem.)

A.W.</EMU>, 2013 VT 107, &para; 8, 195 Vt. 226, 87
A.3d 508 (explaining that motion to modify
prior termination decision based on
changed circumstances does not share the
"compelling policy reason[s]" that allow for
a motion to set aside on grounds of fraud
under &sect; 5113(a) and Rule 60(b)). In considering
those limits, we are guided by the
well-established legal principle that allowing
a parent to seek modification of a
termination order based on changed circumstances
of any type "would preclude a
termination order from ever becoming truly
final, thus denying the timely permanency
to the child that the Legislature specifically
desired." <EMU>In re A.W.</EMU>, 2013 VT 107,
&para; 12, 195 Vt. 226, 87 A.3d 508; see also
<EMU>Cliche</EMU>, 143 Vt. at 307, 466 A.2d at 317.

<P20>&para; 33. There was no legal basis for mother
to set aside the order under either
&sect; 5113(a) and Rule 60(b)(6) or &sect; 5113(b).
As a result, the exclusion of evidence she
sought to offer in support of these theories
was not reversible error. See V.R.E.
103(a).

<CN>II. Motion to Reopen Evidence

<P20>&para; 34. Next, we consider mother's
argument that the trial court erred in denying
her motion to reopen the evidence.
She filed this motion after the court closed
the evidence at the conclusion of the fifth
and final day of the hearing, and before
the court issued its decision. She moved
for permission to call a family support
worker who attended&mdash;but did not testify
at&mdash;the hearings and had been working
with mother through the Defender General's
Office since January 2018. Based on
the family support worker's proposed testimony,
mother also sought leave to recall
the DCF worker who testified at both the
termination hearing and the hearing on
mother's motion for relief from judgment.

<P20>&para; 35. Mother's request was supported by
the affidavit of the family support worker,
which included the following allegations.
<Page 858>
During a virtual shared-parenting meeting
the family support worker attended in the
summer of 2021, she noticed a white substance
under N.G.'s nose. She did not
share this observation with DCF until an
unspecified later date, after she became
aware of concerns regarding substance use
in the foster home. She did not inform
mother's attorney until after the close of
evidence at the hearing related to mother's
motion for relief from judgment. During
that hearing, the family support worker
observed R.G. "nodding off." Immediately
after the final day of the hearing in October
2023, the family support worker saw
the other parties and attorneys "herded"
out the door and overheard a member of
the group she could not conclusively identify
say the words, "good news to share."
The family support worker exited the
courthouse and, through an exterior window,
saw that the group had gathered in
an attorney conference room and was engaged
in discussion that "appeared more
collegial and celebratory" than she would
have expected under the circumstances&mdash;
though she noted that their expressions
changed when they realized that she was
taking a video of them through the window.
Attached were screenshots from this
video.

<P20>&para; 36. In her motion, mother speculated
that in the conference-room meeting, DCF
may have announced that it was now willing
to support G.L.'s adoption by N.G. and
R.G., giving rise to suspicion that DCF
had "misused its power to incentivize the
other parties in the case to oppose [mother's]
motion in exchange for an express or
implied promise that it would support
adoption" if the motion was denied. She
also argued that the proffered evidence
contradicted the DCF worker's sworn testimony
that she had no reason to suspect
that N.G. used substances or that R.G. had
ongoing issues with substance use.

<P20>&para; 37. The court declined to reopen the
evidence for several reasons. It found it
"entirely unclear" why the proffered testimony
was not raised at any other point
during the proceedings, particularly because
the gravamen of mother's argument
was drug use by the foster family, and the
family support worker attended all five
days of the hearing. Moreover, it concluded
that, even taking the family support
worker's representations at face value,
they were "highly anecdotal, unsupported
by any other credible evidence adduced
during the motion hearing[]" and out-weighed
by uncontradicted evidence that
G.L. was never impacted in any way by
substance use or treatment in the foster
home. The court also noted the apparent
lack of legitimate basis for the family support
worker's decision to film a meeting
among other parties and their attorneys in
the courthouse's attorney conference room
without their consent.

<P20>&para; 38. The trial court has
"broad discretion" in ruling on a motion to
reopen filed after the close of evidence but
prior to final judgment, <EMU>In re Bjerke Zoning
Permit Denial</EMU>, 2014 VT 13, &para; 16, 195
Vt. 586, 93 A.3d 82, consistent with its
mandate to "exercise reasonable control
over the mode and order of interrogating
witnesses and presenting evidence so as to
... make the interrogation and presentation
orderly and effective for the ascertainment
of the truth" and "avoid needless
consumption of time," V.R.E. 611(a). We
will uphold the court's decision unless an
assessment of "the entirety of the reasoning
behind the superior court's decision"
reveals that it "withheld its discretion entirely"
or exercised it "for clearly untenable
reasons or to a clearly untenable extent."
<EMU>Bank of Am., N.A. v. O'Kelly</EMU>, 2018
VT 71, &para; 11, 208 Vt. 20, 194 A.3d 746
(quotations omitted).
<Page 859>

<P20>&para; 39. Mother argues that the court
abused its discretion in denying the motion
because the proffered evidence supported
her allegation that DCF was involved in an
ongoing effort to conceal negative information
about G.L.'s foster home and maintain
the termination of mother's parental rights
"at all costs." She asserts that the family
support worker's testimony would have established
that she informed the DCF
worker of the powdery substance allegedly
observed during the 2021 meeting, contravening
the DCF worker's testimony that
she had no evidence that N.G. had used
drugs. However, the family support worker's
affidavit made no reference to this
DCF worker, and only alleged generally
that the family support worker shared the
information with DCF at an unspecified
later time. In any event, mother does not
explain why the court abused its discretion
in assigning weight to her failure to come
forward with this evidence earlier, its speculative
nature, and the limits of its probative
value when considered in connection
with other evidence in the record. Her
mere "disagreement with the court's reasoning
and conclusion ... do[es] not make
out a case for an abuse of discretion."
<EMU>Meyncke v. Meyncke</EMU>, 2009 VT 84, &para; 15,
186 Vt. 571, 980 A.2d 799 (mem.).

<CN>III. Motion to Set Aside Termination
Order for Fraud on the Court

<P20>&para; 40. Lastly, we consider mother's
principal argument on appeal: that the
family division erred in concluding that
DCF did not perpetrate a fraud on the
court and therefore denying her motion for
relief from judgment. She contends that
the trial court applied an incorrect standard
in assessing her claim because it
focused on the knowledge and intentions of
each individual acting on DCF's behalf,
rather than imputing all information in
DCF's possession to the agency as a
whole. In mother's view, when an organization
perpetrates fraud on the court, it is
unnecessary to prove that it was purposefully
orchestrated by any one individual;
instead, conduct that recklessly disregards
the risk of misleading the court is sufficient.

<P20>&para; 41. Whether the family division
applied the correct standard in assessing
mother's fraud-on-the-court claim is a
question of law that we review without
deference. <EMU>Merchant v. Merchant</EMU>, 2015 VT
72, &para; 7, 199 Vt. 406, 124 A.3d 443 ("We
review the legal conclusions of the ...
family division de novo.").

<P20>&para; 42. We consider mother's arguments
regarding the applicable standard in the
context of our existing case law regarding
fraud on the court. We have recognized
that "certain motions for relief from judgment
alleging egregious fraud on the court
in the underlying judgment" are governed
by Rule 60(b)(6), and therefore fall outside
the one-year time limit for motions for
relief based on fraud under 60(b)(3). <EMU>Olio v.
Olio</EMU>, 2012 VT 44, &para;&para; 17-18, 192 Vt. 41, 54
A.3d 510; see <EMU>Godin</EMU>, 168 Vt. at 518-20, 725
A.2d at 907-08. However, we have also
stressed the constrained scope of this exception,
explaining that the fraud-on-the-court
doctrine "`must be narrowly applied,
or it would become indistinguishable from
ordinary fraud, and undermine the important
policy favoring finality of judgments.'"
<EMU>Olio</EMU>, 2012 VT 44, &para; 18, 192 Vt. 41,
54 A.3d 510 (quoting <EMU>Godin</EMU>, 168 Vt. at 518,
725 A.2d at 907); see also 12 J. Moore, et
al., Moore's Federal Practice &para; 60.21[4][c],
at 60-55 (3d ed. 1997) ("If fraud on the
court were to be given a broad interpretation
that encompassed virtually all forms
of fraudulent misconduct between the parties,
judgments would never be final and
the time limitations of Rule 60(b) would be
meaningless.").
<Page 860>

<P20>&para; 43. Our recognition of the exception
was principally based on <EMU>Hazel-Atlas Glass
Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co.</EMU>, 322 U.S. 238,
64 S.Ct. 997, 88 L.Ed. 1250 (1944), which
we described as "[t]he seminal decision in
this area." <EMU>Godin</EMU>, 168 Vt. at 518-19, 725
A.2d at 907 (applying standard articulated
in <EMU>Hazel-Atlas</EMU>). There, the U.S. Supreme
Court found that an attorney's "deliberately
planned and carefully executed scheme
to defraud" an appellate court by fabricating
an article, falsely attributing it to an
author, and then submitting it to receive a
favorable judgment in a patent case was a
"wrong against the institutions set up to
protect and safeguard the public" warranting
exercise of the Court's equitable powers
to set aside the "fraudulently begotten
judgment[]." <EMU>Hazel-Atlas</EMU>, 322 U.S. at 245-46,
64 S.Ct. 997. We measure allegations of
fraud on the court against the conduct at
issue in <EMU>Hazel-Atlas</EMU>, thus distinguishing
between "the type of egregious fraud on
the court that triggers the exception" and
fraud that&mdash;while perhaps worthy of censure
by other means&mdash;does not rise to this
level. <EMU>Olio</EMU>, 2012 VT 44, &para; 22, 192 Vt. 41, 54
A.3d 510; see also <EMU>id</EMU>. &para; 18 (explaining that
in articulating standard, "[w]e specifically
distinguished between cases involving witnesses
who, on the basis of after-discovered
evidence, are believed to have been
guilty of perjury, and those involving the
kind of wrong described ... in ... <EMU>Hazel-Atlas</EMU>");
<EMU>Godin</EMU>, 168 Vt. at 519, 725 A.2d at
908 ("A finding of fraud on the court is
justified only by the most egregious misconduct
directed to the court itself, such as
... fabrication of evidence by counsel."
(quotation omitted)).

<P20>&para; 44. Consistent with our narrow application
of the doctrine, we have repeatedly
used language suggesting that fraud on
the court necessarily involves a deliberate
effort to subvert the judicial process. We
have variously described it as "a course of
<EMU>intentional</EMU> and successful deception and
conduct by a person in respect to a matter
in court which result[s] in a perversion and
obstruction of justice," <EMU>Leno v. Meunier</EMU>,
125 Vt. 30, 35, 209 A.2d 485, 490 (1965)
(emphasis added), and a "<EMU>calculated</EMU> design
to improperly influence the court," <EMU>Godin</EMU>,
168 Vt. at 519, 725 A.2d at 908 (emphasis
added). We have affirmed its existence in
few circumstances, such as where two signatories
to a voluntary acknowledgement
of parentage "<EMU>knowingly</EMU> misrepresented [a
party] to be the child's biological father."
<EMU>McGee v. Gonyo</EMU>, 2016 VT 8, &para; 9, 201 Vt.
216, 140 A.3d 162 (emphasis added).

<P20>&para; 45. Mother cites a Sixth Circuit case,
<EMU>Carter v. Anderson</EMU>, for the proposition
that fraud on the court may arise not just
from conduct that is "intentionally false,"
but also from conduct that is "willfully
blind to the truth[] or is in reckless disregard
for the truth." 585 F.3d 1007, 1011
(6th Cir. 2009). As the Second Circuit recently
explained, the Sixth Circuit stands
alone in applying a recklessness standard,
and the other federal appellate courts that
have addressed the issue generally require
proof of an intentional fraud. <EMU>Mazzei v.
The Money Store</EMU>, 62 F.4th 88, 95 (2d Cir.
2023) (rejecting proposed recklessness
standard and requiring that proponent of
fraud-on-the-court claim prove bad faith);
see also <EMU>United States v. Sierra Pac. Indus.,
Inc.</EMU>, 862 F.3d 1157, 1172 (9th Cir.
2017) (explaining that fraud on the court
must be shown through "willful deception
rather than simply reckless disregard for
the truth"); <EMU>Herring v. United States</EMU>, 424
F.3d 384, 386 (3d Cir. 2005) (requiring
demonstration of "an intentional fraud" on
the court); <EMU>Robinson v. Audi Aktiengesellschaft</EMU>,
56 F.3d 1259, 1267 (10th Cir. 1995)
(rejecting suggestion that statements
made with reckless disregard for truth can
form basis of fraud on court and requiring
showing of "intent to deceive or defraud"),
<EMU>cert. denied</EMU>, 516 U.S. 1045, 116 S.Ct. 705,
<Page 861>
133 L.Ed.2d 661 (1996); <EMU>Wilson v. Johns-Manville
Sales Corp.</EMU>, 873 F.2d 869, 872
(5th Cir. 1989) (requiring proof of "unconscionable
plan or scheme ... designed to
improperly influence the court" (quotation
omitted)); <EMU>Great Coastal Express, Inc. v.
Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen
& Helpers of Am.</EMU>, 675 F.2d
1349, 1356 (4th Cir. 1982) (requiring proof
of "deliberate scheme to directly subvert
the judicial process").

<P20>&para; 46. Mother fails to acknowledge that
the recklessness standard she cites is an
outlier among federal jurisdictions or that
it contravenes the language employed in
our prior decisions, which rely heavily on
cases from those circuits that have concluded
that a reckless mental state is insufficient
to support fraud on the court.
See, e.g., <EMU>Godin</EMU>, 168 Vt. at 520, 725 A.2d at
908 (citing <EMU>Great Coastal Express</EMU>, 675
F.2d at 1356, and <EMU>Wilson</EMU>, 873 F.2d at 872);
see also <EMU>Levinsky v. State</EMU>, 146 Vt. 316,
318, 503 A.2d 534, 536 (1985) (per curiam)
(noting that "we turn to decisions of the
federal courts" for guidance on the parameters
of V.R.C.P. 60(b)(6)). Instead, she
suggests that the standard is particularly
apposite here because DCF is a government
agency and termination proceedings
implicate fundamental rights to family integrity.
As such, she argues, the key question
is "what <EMU>the agency</EMU> knew and when
<EMU>the agency</EMU> knew it," and it is unnecessary
to show that any one individual knowingly
orchestrated a fraud on the court or that
DCF's attorneys intentionally presented
false evidence.

<P20>&para; 47. Mother cites <EMU>In re Brannan</EMU>, 485
B.R. 443, 450 (Bankr. S.D. Ala. 2013), for
the proposition that an organization commits
fraud on the court where it fails to
establish a procedure to ensure that the
facts presented to the court are true and
accurate. In that case, a putative class of
debtors alleged that a mortgage company
&mdash;through its employees and attorneys
&mdash;perpetrated fraud on the court in
numerous bankruptcy proceedings by preparing
and filing affidavits that were neither
carefully reviewed by all affiants nor
notarized in compliance with the applicable
state law. The Bankruptcy Court concluded
that these allegations, if proven, were
"a basis for remedial action based on fraud
on the court" because "[t]he affidavits, if
prepared as alleged, were at least <EMU>recklessly</EMU>
prepared under counsel's direction
and submitted by counsel to the court to
obtain relief." <EMU>Id</EMU>. at 452-53 (emphasis added).
Because this analysis hinged on the
court's application, without any supporting
analysis, of the scienter requirement the
Sixth Circuit set forth in <EMU>Carter</EMU>, it offers
little additional support for mother's argument.
<EMU>Id</EMU>. at 453 (citing <EMU>Carter</EMU>, 585 F.3d at
1011). Indeed, we note that the Southern
District of Alabama is part of the Eleventh
Circuit, which has observed that its precedent
regarding fraud on the court "requires
the demonstration of a plan or
scheme ... designed to improperly influence
the court, which indicates that scienter
is required." <EMU>In re Baron's Stores, Inc.</EMU>,
307 F. App'x 396, 397-98 (11th Cir. 2009)
(concluding that, to extent movants suggested
recklessness conduct satisfied this
requirement, claim had not been preserved
for appeal) (quotation omitted).

<P20>&para; 48. Mother also argues that <EMU>Demjanjuk
v. Petrovsky</EMU> supports the conclusions
that where a government agency is alleged
to have engaged in fraud on the court, it
cannot raise a "`the-right-hand-did-not-know-what-the-left-hand-was-doing'
argument"
in defense, and it is irrelevant
whether any individual representative of
the agency was acting in good faith. 10
F.3d 338, 353 (6th Cir. 1993). In <EMU>Demjanjuk</EMU>,
the court appointed a special master
to investigate whether U.S. Department of
Justice attorneys engaged in fraud on the
court when they failed to disclose exculpatory
<Page 862>
information in their possession during
a habeas corpus proceeding in which the
petitioner sought to prevent his extradition
to Israel, where he faced capital charges of
murder. The evidence in the government
attorneys' possession supported the petitioner's
primary defense&mdash;that he had
been misidentified as a Nazi war criminal
who shared his first name. The special
master issued a report concluding that
"the intent requirement `is satisfied by
proof of an actual intent to defraud, of
wil[l]ful blindness to the truth, or of a
reckless disregard for the truth.'" <EMU>Id</EMU>. at
348 (citation omitted) (emphasis omitted).

<P20>&para; 49. The Sixth Circuit explained that
"[a]lthough there are cases holding that a
`plan or scheme' must exist in order to find
fraud on the court, we agree with [the
special master] that a scheme, based on a
subjective intent to commit fraud, is not
required in a case such as this. Reckless
disregard for the truth is sufficient."<fnr8> <EMU>Id</EMU>.
at 352-53. The court went on to explain the
circumstances that made application of the
recklessness standard appropriate in this
instance. It concluded that where the government
seeks denaturalization or extradition
based on proof of alleged criminal
activities, its attorneys have a duty to disclose
exculpatory evidence in their possession
akin to that imposed by the U.S.
Supreme Court in <EMU>Brady v. Maryland</EMU> in
criminal cases on the premise that, "`the
suppression by the prosecution of evidence
favorable to an accused upon request violates
due process where the evidence is
material either to guilt or to punishment,
irrespective of the good faith or bad faith
of the prosecution.'" <EMU>Id</EMU>. at 353 (quoting
<EMU>Brady v. Maryland</EMU>, 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83
S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963)) (observing
that the Department of Justice attorneys
"presented their case as showing that
Demjanjuk was guilty of mass murder").
The Sixth Circuit characterized the attorneys'
conduct as "prosecutorial misconduct
that seriously misled the court." <EMU>Id</EMU>. at 339.

<P20>&para; 50. This case is not like <EMU>Demjanjuk</EMU>.
Although mother argues that public-policy
considerations favor a fraud-on-the-court
standard that compels DCF's full
disclosure of all evidence concerning the
safety and suitability of a preadoptive
placement for a child in state custody, she
does not contend that her due-process
rights demand it. In analyzing mother's
public-policy argument, we recognize that
fundamental rights are at stake in termination
proceedings and that weighty obligations
fall on counsel for the State. See <EMU>In
re A.D.</EMU>, 143 Vt. 432, 435-36, 467 A.2d 121,
124 (1983) (recognizing that "[w]hen the
State intervenes in the area of child neglect,"
parents' "fundamental interest[]
... in maintaining family integrity" is implicated);
see also <EMU>In re L.H.</EMU>, 2018 VT 4,
&para; 24, 206 Vt. 596, 182 A.3d 612 (explaining
that attorneys "advising and representing
the State in abuse-and-neglect cases" have
duty to do so "in an effort to advance the
best interests of the children in a way that
is fair and just to all concerned"). But
mother has not established that these considerations
mandate deviation from the
standard we have applied to every other
fraud-on-the-court case before us&mdash;the
standard that prevails in the majority of
federal courts. See, e.g., <EMU>United States v.
Sierra Pac. Indus.</EMU>, 100 F. Supp. 3d 948,
960 (E.D. Cal. 2015), <EMU>aff'd sub nom. Sierra</EMU>
<Page 863>
<EMU>Pac. Indus.</EMU>, 862 F.3d 1157 ("The Supreme
Court and Ninth Circuit have repeatedly
analyzed claims of fraud on the court by
government attorneys without suggesting
that their conduct is to be evaluated in
light of any heightened obligations." (collecting
cases)).

<P20>&para; 51. Mother cites <EMU>Division of Family
Services v. S.P.</EMU>, 120 A.3d 26 (Del. Fam. Ct.
2015), in which a Delaware family court
held that the Division of Family Services
mistakenly interpreted a state statute as
requiring full review and disclosure of only
reports of abuse by prospective adoptive
parents that had been substantiated. This
conclusion rested on the court's interpretation
of the relevant statute, which was
informed, among other things, by the recognition
of a legislative policy favoring disclosure.
<EMU>Id</EMU>. at 32. However, the decision
referenced fraud on the court only equivocally,
noting that if the Division had asked
an adoptive father about prior allegations
of child abuse, and if the father failed to
disclose such reports, the "adoption could
be seen as the product of a fraud upon the
Court and[,] potentially, voided or vacated."
<EMU>Id</EMU>. at 29. This passing observation,
pertaining to the conduct of an adoptive
parent rather than the relevant child-protection
agency, does nothing to advance
mother's public-policy argument.

<P20>&para; 52. Relatedly, mother asserts
that without full access to the information
in DCF's possession regarding the foster
parents, it was impossible for the court to
make an "accurate determination" regarding
whether to terminate her parental
rights. As the trial court recognized, however,
issues pertaining to N.G. and R.G.
were ancillary to the determination of
whether mother's parental rights should
be terminated. "[A] termination proceeding
is not a custody case in which the
family court must balance the respective
advantages of different placement options,
but rather a legislatively created proceeding
in which the court is required to weigh
specified statutory factors" in determining
whether to terminate parental rights. <EMU>In re
R.B.</EMU>, 2015 VT 100, &para; 20, 200 Vt. 45, 126
A.3d 496 (quotations and alteration omitted);
see also 33 V.S.A. &sect;&sect; 5113(b), 5114(a).
It is true that a child's adjustment to
home, school, and community, and "interaction
and interrelationship" with "any ...
person who may significantly affect the
child's best interests," including "foster
parents, if any," are among these factors.
33 V.S.A. &sect; 5114(a)(1), (2). But they are not
dispositive: the most important factor, as
the court recognized in its termination order,
is whether the parent will be able to
resume parenting duties within a reasonable
time. <EMU>In re C.P.</EMU>, 2012 VT 100, &para; 30,
193 Vt. 29, 71 A.3d 1142; see 33 V.S.A.
&sect; 5114(a)(3).

<P20>&para; 53. Thus, "we have repeatedly stated
`that a valid termination of parental rights
does not depend on the availability of permanent
foster care or adoption.'" <EMU>In re
S.B.</EMU>, 174 Vt. 427, 430, 800 A.2d 476, 480-81
(2002) (mem.) (quoting <EMU>In re D.M.</EMU>, 162 Vt.
33, 40, 641 A.2d 774, 778 (1994)); see also
<EMU>In re R.B.</EMU>, 2015 VT 100, &para; 19, 200 Vt. 45,
126 A.3d 496 ("Any question about the
children's placement has no bearing on
whether the court erred in terminating
parents' rights."); <EMU>In re L.A.</EMU>, 154 Vt. 147,
160, 574 A.2d 782, 789 (1990) (noting that
absence of statutory "requirement for an
alternative placement is reasonable since
the termination of parental rights may be
necessary to allow the children to bond to
a new family"). Given how far removed any
information pertaining to a child's foster
placement is from the pivotal issues in a
termination proceeding, this policy argument
does not support mother's contention
that the case should be analyzed under a
different standard. See, e.g., <EMU>United States
v. Est. of Stonehill</EMU>, 660 F.3d 415, 452 (9th
<Page 864>
Cir. 2011) (observing that "in nearly all
fraud-on-the-court cases, the misrepresentations
went to the central issue in the
case," and declining to find fraud on the
court where "the government's misrepresentations
were relatively few" and "largely
tangential" to fundamental questions
presented).

<P20>&para; 54. Mother notes that Vermont
Rule for Family Proceedings 2(d)(6)
provides that, "[u]pon the filing of a petition,
a party's attorney shall be permitted
to inspect or photocopy all material or
information within the possession, custody
or control of [DCF] which relates to the
child, the parent(s), the guardian(s), or
which is otherwise relevant to the subject
matter of the proceedings," although any
party or DCF may move for a protective
order. She contends that under the rule,
DCF has a duty to either disclose the
information in RLSI files on request or
move for a protective order, and that this
obligation promotes child safety by limiting
DCF's ability to conceal information
about foster parents that might undermine
the agency's position. However, mother
does not explain why the existence of Rule
2(d)(6) should impact the analysis of her
fraud-on-the-court claim.<fnr9> Even accepting,
for the sake of argument, that Attorney
Burroughs was required to provide Attorney
Groce with the RLSI records pertaining
to R.G. and N.G. in response to his
request for "the DCF file [o]n [G.L.]," "the
mere nondisclosure to an adverse party
and to the court of facts pertinent to a
controversy before the court does not add
up to fraud upon the court for purposes of
vacating a judgment under Rule 60(b)."
<EMU>Godin</EMU>, 168 Vt. at 520, 725 A.2d at 908
(quotation omitted); see also <EMU>Stonehill</EMU>, 660
F.3d at 445 (proponents of fraud-on-the-court
claim "must show more than perjury
or nondisclosure of evidence, unless that
perjury or nondisclosure was so fundamental
that it undermined the workings of the
adversary process itself"); <EMU>Bulloch v. United
States</EMU>, 763 F.2d 1115, 1121 (10th Cir.
1985) ("[A]llegations of nondisclosure in
pretrial discovery will not support an action
for fraud on the court.").

<P20>&para; 55. We conclude that in Vermont,
a claim of fraud on the court demands
a corresponding showing of intent
to deceive by an individual actor or group
of actors, regardless of the identity of the
parties or the character of the legal issues
involved. As the Tenth Circuit aptly explained:

<B22>We think it clear that "fraud on the
court," whatever else it embodies, requires
a showing that one has acted with
an intent to deceive or defraud the
court. A proper balance between the
interests underlying finality on the one
hand and allowing relief due to inequitable
conduct on the other makes it essential
that there be a showing of conscious
wrongdoing&mdash;what can properly be
characterized as a deliberate scheme to
defraud&mdash;before relief from a final judgment
is appropriate under the <EMU>Hazel-Atlas</EMU>
<Page 865>
standard. Thus, when there is no
intent to deceive, the fact that misrepresentations
were made to a court is not of
itself a sufficient basis for setting aside a
judgment under the guise of "fraud on
the court."

<P00><EMU>Robinson</EMU>, 56 F.3d at 1267. This reasoning
squares with the jurisprudential origins of
our doctrine and the principles of finality
we have centered in every case applying
the standard. See <EMU>Olio</EMU>, 2012 VT 44, &para; 22,
192 Vt. 41, 54 A.3d 510 (explaining that
"[i]n crafting our approach to [fraud-on-the-court]
cases, we have struck a balance
between the competing imperatives of finality
of judgments, on the one hand, and
justice in every case on the other"). The
trial court did not err in applying that
same standard to mother's fraud-on-the-court
claim.<fnr10>

<P20>&para; 56. Mother does not challenge the
court's factual findings, which amply support
its conclusion that DCF did not engage
in any deliberate effort to deceive the
court in connection with the underlying
termination proceedings. Moreover, as the
court found, the information at issue had
no bearing on the primary considerations
it weighed in ordering termination of
mother's parental rights. Regardless of
G.L.'s current placement, mother failed to
progress in key aspects of her case plan
and there was no indication that she would
be able to resume parenting within a reasonable
time from the perspective of a
child who had been in DCF custody for
most of her young life. Mother's motion to
set aside the termination order was appropriately
denied.

<P20><EMU>Affirmed</EMU>.
<FN>
<fnt1> Father's rights in G.L. were terminated in
the same order. He did not join mother's
motion and is not a party to this appeal. As a
result, this decision focuses on the facts relevant
to mother.

<fnt2> In its decision on mother's motion for relief
from judgment, the family division made no
findings regarding the second investigation,
noting that the related documentation was
not admitted into evidence because DCF
questioned the credibility of the juvenile complainant.

<fnt3> As the State notes, the December 2021 order
was not included in the appeal volume.
But see V.R.A.P. 1(c)(7) (explaining that appeal
volume contains "all the documents filed
and created in the trial court proceeding that
are contained in the electronic case file"). The
order is nonetheless part of the record on
appeal. V.R.A.P. 10(a)(3) (providing that record
on appeal includes "the record of actions
from the superior court").

<fnt4> Mother also alleged that R.G.'s substance-use-disorder
treatment constituted "newly
discovered evidence" under Rule 60(b)(2).
However, as mother later conceded, this argument
was time-barred because her motion
was filed more than a year after the termination
order was entered. See V.R.C.P. 60(b)
("The motion shall be filed within a reasonable
time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not
more than one year after the judgment, order,
or proceeding was entered or taken.").

<fnt5> To the extent mother suggests that the exclusion
of this evidence was error because it
was also relevant to her fraud-on-the-court
claim or because 33 V.S.A. &sect; 5101(a)(4) provides
that the juvenile judicial proceedings
statute should be construed "to ensure that
safety ... for children" is a "paramount concern[],"
we do not consider these arguments
because they were raised for the first time in
her reply brief. See <EMU>Robertson v. Mylan
Lab'ys, Inc.</EMU>, 2004 VT 15, &para; 2 n.2, 176 Vt. 356,
848 A.2d 310 ("We need not consider an
argument raised for the first time in a reply
brief.").

<fnt6> The State contends that mother waived all
alternative arguments raised in her original
motion by filing her April 28 amended motion
setting forth her fraud-on-the-court claim
with greater particularity. Mother's amended
motion merely clarified the basis for her
fraud-on-the-court claim following discovery,
as ordered by the court, and did not supersede
her prior filings or operate as a waiver of
her alternative arguments.

<fnt7> For this reason, we need not consider
whether mother waived her &sect; 5113(b) argument
when she failed to address it in her
March 20 memorandum.

<fnt8> We note that the Sixth Circuit in <EMU>Carter</EMU>
drew the general recklessness standard directly
from <EMU>Demjanjuk</EMU>, though it did not acknowledge
<EMU>Demjanjuk</EMU>'s holding that application
of the standard was appropriate because
of the singular details of that case. <EMU>Carter</EMU>, 585
F.3d at 1011; see also, e.g., D. Roy, <EMU>The Sixth
Circuit's Unprecedented Reopening of Demjanjuk
v. Petrovsky</EMU>, 42 Clev. St. L. Rev. 737,
745 (1994) (explaining that <EMU>Demjanjuk</EMU> is factually
and procedurally unique).

<fnt9> Similarly, mother cites provisions of the
Rules of Professional Conduct which provide
that a lawyer may not "fail to correct a false
statement of material fact ... previously
made to the tribunal by the lawyer,"
V.R.Pr.C. 3.3(a)(1), or "unlawfully obstruct
another party's access to evidence," V.R.Pr.C.
3.4(a), but she does not bridge the gap between
this language and her fraud-on-the-court
argument. The rules are "designed to
provide guidance to lawyers" and "a structure
for regulating conduct through disciplinary
agencies," and expressly provide that
nothing therein "should be deemed to augment
or diminish any substantive legal duty of
lawyers or the extradisciplinary consequences
of violating such a duty." V.R.Pr.C. Scope. As
a result, it is not clear how they can have any
bearing on the standard applicable to a fraud-on-the-court
claim, even assuming mother is
correct in contending that they were violated.

<fnt10> It is not entirely clear whether mother also
contends that the trial court erred in denying
her motion under this standard. Though
mother sets forth the abuse-of-discretion standard
applicable to an assertion that the trial
court erred in declining to grant relief under
Rule 60(b)(6), she makes no explicit accompanying
argument. See V.R.A.P. 28(a)(4)(B)
(providing that appellant's principal brief
must include "a concise statement of the applicable
standard of review" for each issue
presented); <EMU>In re C.L.S.</EMU>, 2021 VT 25, &para; 9, 214
Vt. 379, 253 A.3d 443 (noting that we "apply
a deferential standard of review to a court's
exercise of its discretion under Rule
60(b)(6)"). As a result, we conclude that this
argument&mdash;to the extent mother intended to
raise it&mdash;is inadequately briefed and do not
address it. See <EMU>In re Snyder Grp., Inc.</EMU>, 2020
VT 15, &para; 26 n.10, 212 Vt. 168, 233 A.3d 1077
(declining to reach inadequately briefed argument).

<P20>APPEALED FROM: Superior Court,

<P20>Present: REIBER, C.J., EATON,

[MT]
<CN><EMBU>ENTRY ORDER</EMBU>

<P20>&para; 1. Defendant Kwesi Wilson appeals a
trial court order holding him without bail
pending his criminal trial. He argues that
the court erred in concluding that the evidence
of guilt was great under 13 V.S.A.
<Page 867>
&sect; 7553 and in failing to consider the weight
of the evidence in its analysis of the
&sect; 7554(b) factors for discretionary release.
We conclude that defendant's argument as
to the evidence of guilt was not preserved
because defendant stipulated that the evidence
of guilt was great, and that the court
did not abuse its discretion in weighing the
&sect; 7554(b) factors. Accordingly, we affirm
the hold-without-bail order.

<P20>&para; 2. Defendant was charged on May 22,
2024, with two counts of eluding a law
enforcement officer, 23 V.S.A. &sect; 1133(b)(2),
one count of aggravated operation of a
motor vehicle without the consent of the
owner, 23 V.S.A. &sect; 1094(b), one count of
violating conditions of release, 13 V.S.A.
&sect; 7559(e),<fnr*> and one count of repeatedly
operating a vehicle with a suspended license,
23 V.S.A. &sect; 674(a)(2). The first three
counts are felony charges. Because defendant
has three prior felony convictions&mdash;
one each in Vermont, Connecticut, and
Massachusetts&mdash;the State charged defendant
as a habitual offender, which enhances
the possible sentence "upon conviction
of such fourth or subsequent [felony]
to imprisonment up to and including life."
13 V.S.A. &sect; 11.

<P20>&para; 3. Because defendant was charged
with an offense punishable by life imprisonment,
the State sought an order to hold
defendant without bail, pursuant to 13
V.S.A. &sect; 7553. At defendant's preliminary
hearing, the court granted the request to
hold defendant without bail pending a
weight-of-the-evidence hearing.

<P20>&para; 4. At the weight-of-the-evidence hearing,
held on June 5, 2024, defendant stipulated
that the evidence of guilt was great
with respect to the two counts of eluding a
law enforcement officer, but asked the
court to exercise its discretion in granting
conditions of release. Defense counsel elicited
testimony from defendant's mother,
who indicated that she would be willing to
supervise defendant's release and report
him if he failed to follow the conditions.
However, she stated that she could not
"support him a hundred percent" given her
work and other family obligations.

<P20>&para; 5. The court ruled on defendant's request
orally from the bench, weighing the
&sect; 7554(b) factors to evaluate defendant's
risk of flight and danger to the public. The
court emphasized both the number and the
severity of the offenses with which defendant
was charged and noted that the potential
punishment of life imprisonment
created a significant risk of flight. The
court also noted that the nature of the
eluding-law-enforcement charge created
both risk of flight and danger to the public,
given that defendant fled from police by
driving erratically on a public road. On the
other factors, the court found that defendant
was not working, that he lacked financial
resources to pay bail, that he was
struggling with drug addiction, and that he
had strong ties to the community through
his mother. Finally, the court noted that
defendant had a history of eleven failures
to appear in previous proceedings.

<P20>&para; 6. The court then examined the potential
conditions of release and concluded
that none would adequately mitigate the
risk of flight and danger to the public
posed by defendant. The court noted that
defendant was already on conditions of
release at the time of the charged offenses
and found that imposing more restrictive
conditions would be ineffective "because
that has been imposed and it just did not
work." It also found that defendant's
mother could not serve as a responsible
<Page 868>
adult because of her work and family responsibilities.
Accordingly, the court denied
defendant's request, concluding that
he had not overcome the presumption in
favor of the hold without bail. See <EMU>State v.
Auclair</EMU>, 2020 VT 26, &para; 24, 211 Vt. 651, 229
A.3d 1019 (mem.) (stating that where
"[d]efendant has conceded that the State
has met its burden under the &sect; 7553
weight-of-the-evidence standard ... the
presumption is switched so that the norm
is incarceration and not release" (quotation
omitted)).

<P20>&para; 7. On August 2, 2024, defendant filed a
motion to review bail with the trial court,
indicating that he had reached a tentative
agreement with the State in all other
pending cases against him. The motion
requested a new bail hearing based on the
fact that the court's hold-without-bail order
had referenced the other pending
cases as a factor in its decision. The court
denied the motion without a hearing, concluding
that "[d]efendant's agreement to
resolve his pending cases in other counties
is not a basis to schedule a bail review
hearing in this matter to reconsider this
Court's decision." Defendant appealed to
this Court, indicating that he intended to
challenge the court's denial of his motion
to review bail.

<P20>&para; 8. On appeal, however, defendant
makes no argument regarding the denial
of this motion, but instead focuses entirely
on the June hold-without-bail order. In
response, the State filed a motion to dismiss,
arguing that the appeal of the hold-without-bail
order is untimely under Vermont
Rule of Appellate Procedure
(V.R.A.P.) 4(a)(1). Because we conclude
that defendant's challenges to the hold-without-bail
order are meritless, we need
not decide whether the appeal deadline in
V.R.A.P. 4 applies in the context of bail
appeals.

<P20>&para; 9. Defendant first argues that the
trial court erred in concluding that the
evidence of guilt was great because the
affidavits submitted by the State do not
include any sworn statements alleging that
he was driving the car at the time of the
two eluding-law-enforcement charges. Defendant
argues that the evidence therefore
failed to meet the standard of Vermont
Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(d). See
<EMU>State v. Duff</EMU>, 151 Vt. 433, 440, 563 A.2d
258, 263 (1989) (adopting Rule 12(d) standard
as "the correct standard of review"
under &sect; 7553 and stating that "[i]f the
State ... intends to deny bail pursuant to
13 V.S.A. &sect; 7553, the State must show that
facts exist that are legally sufficient to
sustain a verdict of guilty").

<P20>&para; 10. We decline to review the sufficiency
of the evidence here because defendant
stipulated at the weight-of-the-evidence
hearing that the evidence of guilt was
great. At the hearing, defendant and the
State agreed that the weight of the evidence
was great as to the eluding-law-enforcement
charges, but not as to the
other charges. "To the extent defendant
contested the stipulation, it was his obligation
to speak at that time." <EMU>State v.
Loveland</EMU>, 165 Vt. 418, 421, 684 A.2d 272,
275 (1996). Instead, defendant's sole argument
at the hearing was that the court
should exercise its discretion to release
him, notwithstanding the fact that the evidence
of guilt was great. Defendant's argument
that the evidence of guilt was not
great is therefore not preserved for appeal.
See <EMU>State v. Boyer</EMU>, 2021 VT 19, &para; 18,
214 Vt. 633, 252 A.3d 804 (mem.) ("Because
defendant did not raise this specific argument
in his motion for bail review or in the
hearing on his motion, he has failed to
preserve it for appeal.").

<P20>&para; 11. Second, defendant argues that
the court abused its discretion in denying
him bail without examining "the weakness
<Page 869>
of the prosecution's case with regards to
any risk of flight." Defendant cites to our
decision in <EMU>Auclair</EMU>, where we explained
that in weighing the &sect; 7554 factors for
discretionary release, "the weight-of-the-evidence
factor can also refer to the relative
strength of the State's case against
the defendant." 2020 VT 26, &para; 18, 211 Vt.
651, 229 A.3d 1019; see 13 V.S.A.
&sect; 7554(b)(1) (listing various factors that
courts may consider in determining which
conditions of release to impose, including
"the weight of the evidence against the
accused"). Defendant argues that the
court's failure to address the "lack of corroboration"
that he was the one driving
the car constitutes reversible error.

<P20>&para; 12. We review a trial court's
decision "on whether to deny bail in accordance
with the 7554(b) factors for an abuse
of discretion." <EMU>State v. Orost</EMU>, 2017 VT 110,
&para; 6, 206 Vt. 657, 179 A.3d 763 (mem.). "In
exercising its discretion to release a defendant,
the trial court <EMU>may</EMU> look to the factors
listed in &sect; 7554, including the weight
of evidence against the accused," but
"there is no requirement that a court consider
all of the factors listed in &sect; 7554
when exercising its discretion." <EMU>State v.
Ford</EMU>, 2015 VT 127, &para;&para; 10-11, 200 Vt. 650,
130 A.3d 862 (mem.) (emphasis added). A
court's discretion in this area "is extremely
broad, but its decision cannot be arbitrary."
<EMU>State v. Avgoustov</EMU>, 2006 VT 90,
&para; 2, 180 Vt. 595, 907 A.2d 1185 (mem.).

<P20>&para; 13. We conclude that the court acted
well within its discretion in declining to
release defendant under &sect; 7554(b). The
court was not required to consider every
factor in &sect; 7554 when exercising its discretion.
<EMU>Ford</EMU>, 2015 VT 127, &para; 11, 200 Vt. 650,
130 A.3d 862. Nevertheless, the court did
discuss the weight-of-the-evidence factor,
noting that defendant "stipulated that the
evidence of guilt is great" as to the eluding-law-enforcement
charges and describing
this as "a factor in favor of continued
incarceration." However, the court placed
greater emphasis on other factors, including
the nature and circumstances of the
offense charged and defendant's record of
appearance at prior court proceedings. The
court did not abuse its discretion either in
accepting defendant's stipulation as to the
weight of the evidence or in placing greater
emphasis on the other statutory factors.
See, e.g., <EMU>Orost</EMU>, 2017 VT 110, &para; 11, 206 Vt.
657, 179 A.3d 763 (concluding that court's
"discussion of the multiple significant factors
that were central to its analysis was
sufficient" to deny discretionary release);
<EMU>Auclair</EMU>, 2020 VT 26, &para; 21, 211 Vt. 651, 229
A.3d 1019 (affirming court's denial of discretionary
release where it "made clear
that its decision was based primarily on
two factors, which it found to be controlling").

<P20><EMU>Affirmed</EMU>.
<FN>
<fnt*> We note that 13 V.S.A. &sect; 7559(e) was repealed
by the Legislature on May 30, 2024, and that
the substantive language has been moved to
13 V.S.A. &sect; 7559(a). 2023, No. 138 (Adj.

<P20>&para; 1. In this case, we consider whether
the Human Services Board may grant relief
to a person with disabilities who is not
receiving the services to which he is entitled.
Through Medicaid programs administered
by the Department of Disabilities,
Aging, and Independent Living (DAIL),
K.M. is supposed to receive more than
thirty hours of support services each week.
Since March 2020, he has received no more
than five hours of services each week.
K.M. petitioned the Board seeking an order
directing DAIL to provide all the services
to which he is entitled. The Board
dismissed his petition for failure to state a
claim upon which relief can be granted. We
reverse the Board's dismissal of K.M.'s
petition and remand to the Board for further
proceedings.

<P20>&para; 2. The following facts are drawn from
the record and are undisputed for purposes
of this appeal. K.M. is an adult with
numerous disabilities, including autism, obsessive-compulsive
disorder, a seizure disorder,
and other conditions. For more than
twenty years, he has received Medicaid-funded
home and community-based developmental
disabilities services provided by
Washington County Mental Health Services
(WCMHS). WCMHS is supposed to
provide more than thirty hours per week
of community supports. Since March 2020,
K.M. has received only two-to-five hours of
community supports each week. The reduction
in services has caused K.M. various
negative health effects.

<P20>&para; 3. WCMHS is a member of Vermont
Care Partners, a statewide network of six-teen
nonprofit community-based organizations
that provide developmental disability
services. The agencies that comprise Vermont
Care Partners collectively report
their staffing shortages and vacancies. The
agencies report high staff vacancy and
turnover rates for positions that provide
care. A study of that workforce in Vermont
found that low wages contribute to departures
from the profession.

<P20>&para; 4. Though WCMHS is K.M.'s service
provider, DAIL is ultimately responsible
for all Medicaid-funded developmental services
in Vermont. 18 V.S.A. &sect; 8723. DAIL
allocates and disburses Medicaid funds for
the services, which are provided by designated
agencies and specialized services
agencies. <EMU>Id</EMU>. &sect; 8907. Medicaid is a cooperative
federal-state program under which
states receive federal funds for state-administered
Medicaid services in exchange
for compliance with the requirements of
the Medicaid Act. See 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 1396 to
1396w-8; see also <EMU>Brisson v. Dep't of Soc.
Welfare</EMU>, 167 Vt. 148, 150, 702 A.2d 405,
407 (1997).

<P20>&para; 5. The federal Medicaid Act requires
that state Medicaid programs "provide
that all individuals wishing to make application
for medical assistance under the
plan shall have opportunity to do so, and
that such assistance shall be furnished
with reasonable promptness to all eligible
individuals." 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1396a(a)(8). The
statute defines "medical assistance" as
"payment of part or all of the cost of the
following care and services <EMU>or</EMU> the care and
services themselves, or <EMU>both</EMU>." <EMU>Id</EMU>.
&sect; 1396d(a) (emphasis added). Implementing
regulations require the designated
state agency to: "(a) [f]urnish Medicaid
promptly to beneficiaries without any delay
caused by the agency's administrative
procedures" and "(b) [c]ontinue to furnish
<Page 872>
Medicaid regularly to all eligible individuals
until they are found to be ineligible." 42
C.F.R. &sect; 435.930.

<P20>&para; 6. State law echoes the federal Medicaid
requirements. DAIL must, "within the
limits of funds designated by the General
Assembly for this purpose, ensure that
community services ... are provided." 18
V.S.A. &sect; 8907(a). DAIL's obligations extend
to individual recipients. "Any person
with a developmental disability ... <EMU>shall</EMU>
be provided with ... [s]ervices and funding
within the Department's available resources
in accordance with both the system
of care plan and the person's ...
written plan of service." <EMU>Id</EMU>. &sect; 8726(c) (emphasis
added). If a recipient has a "claim
for assistance, benefits, or services" that is
"not acted upon with reasonable promptness,"
the Human Services Board must
grant the recipient a fair hearing. 3 V.S.A.
&sect; 3091(a).

<P20>&para; 7. In this case, K.M. asked the Board
to order DAIL to provide him with all the
services for which he is eligible under state
and federal law with "reasonable promptness,"
as contemplated by 3 V.S.A.
&sect; 3091(a) and 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1396a(a)(3). The
Board concluded that his request did not
state a cognizable claim for relief because
it was "too vague to inform the Department
as to the action to take in order to
comply with an injunction." It explained
that "[a]n order directing the Department
to provide services when there is no staff
available to perform them falls short of
informing the Department of what would
be required for compliance." The Board
also interpreted K.M.'s request as seeking
an order commanding DAIL to "address
either the statewide staffing problem with
the requisite urgency and/or the issue of
Developmental Services staff wages." It
found that "any determination made by
the Board about the validity of DAIL's
policy would not affect the level of services
that [K.M.] received, so the Board could
grant no relief,'" quoting <EMU>Husrefovich v.
Department of Aging & Independent Living</EMU>,
2006 VT 17, &para; 28, 179 Vt. 456, 898 A.2d
726. The Board therefore granted DAIL's
motion to dismiss K.M.'s petition. K.M.
appealed.

<P20>&para; 8. On appeal, K.M. argues that
the Board erred in concluding that it
lacked authority to order DAIL to provide
the benefits to which he is entitled. Whether
the Board has the authority to grant
relief is a question of law that we review
de novo. <EMU>In re P.J.</EMU>, 2009 VT 5, &para; 7, 185 Vt.
606, 969 A.2d 133 (mem.). On appeal from
a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon
which relief can be granted, "we assume
the truth of all factual allegations in the
[petition] and accept all reasonable inferences
that may be derived from [the petitioner's]
pleadings." <EMU>In re Blow</EMU>, 2013 VT
75, &para; 8, 194 Vt. 416, 82 A.3d 554 (quotation
omitted).

<P20>&para; 9. We agree with K.M. that the Board
had authority to grant relief here. The
Board has statutory authorization to
"make orders consistent with this title requiring
the Agency to provide appropriate
relief including retroactive and prospective
benefits." 3 V.S.A. &sect; 3091(d). The Board
has the authority to order DAIL to provide
prospective benefits to an individual
who asserts that his services have not been
provided with "reasonable promptness," as
is required by federal and state statute.
See 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1396a(a)(8) (providing that
medical assistance under the plan "shall be
furnished with reasonable promptness to
all eligible individuals"); 3 V.S.A. &sect; 3091(a)
(providing right to hearing when claim for
assistance, benefits, or services is "not acted
upon with reasonable promptness").

<P20>&para; 10. The Board and DAIL correctly
note that this Court has stated that
"[t]he Board does not have the power to
issue a declaratory judgment or an injunction."
<Page 873>
<EMU>Husrefovich</EMU>, 2006 VT 17, &para; 28,
179 Vt. 456, 898 A.2d 726. A closer reading
of <EMU>Husrefovich</EMU>, however, reflects
greater nuance. While the Board cannot
issue injunctions unrelated to an "individual's
situation," 3 V.S.A. &sect; 3091(a), it retains
authority to provide appropriate relief
to a claimant. <EMU>Husrefovich</EMU>, 2006 VT
17, &para; 28, 179 Vt. 456, 898 A.2d 726. In
<EMU>Husrefovich</EMU>, the petitioners sought to
have the Board declare DAIL's policy
change illegal because of its noncompliance
with statutory rulemaking procedures.
<EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 8. We affirmed the Board's
rejection of their request because the petitioners
could not show that properly
promulgated rules would affect their benefits.
<EMU>Id</EMU>. &para;&para; 9, 28. Since the petitioners
could not show that the rule affected their
situation as claimants, the Board could
neither declare the rule invalid nor enjoin
its enforcement. <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 28. This one sentence
from <EMU>Husrefovich</EMU>, quoted by DAIL
and relied upon by the Board in this case,
must be considered in its context.

<P20>&para; 11. DAIL points us to various Board
decisions to support its contention that,
after <EMU>Husrefovich</EMU>, the Board understands
that it lacks authority to grant injunctive
relief even where necessary to grant relief
to an individual. DAIL's reliance on these
cases is misplaced. Neither those decisions,
nor any other Board decisions referencing
<EMU>Husrefovich</EMU>, support such a limiting construction
or provide evidence that the
Board has previously construed <EMU>Husrefovich</EMU>
in such a way.

<P20>&para; 12. In Fair Hearing No. A-12/20-846,
for example, the petitioner requested that
the Board order the Department for Children
and Families to remove records of its
investigation of the petitioner after it
agreed to remove her from the child abuse
registry. The Board declined to order the
Department to remove the records because
the Department was charged with
"`maintain[ing] all records of all investigations,
assessments, reviews, and responses'"
to child abuse charges. Fair Hearing
No. A-12/20-846, at 5 (Hum. Servs. Bd.
June 4, 2021) (quoting 33 V.S.A. &sect; 4921(a)),
https://outside.vermont.gov/agency/AHSHSB/Orders/Documents/2021/FH-A-12-20-846%20Order.pdf
[https://perma.cc/ELX9-E56D].
Though the Board did note
that it was "without authority to issue any
type of injunctive relief," it found it was
unable to offer relief to the petitioner because
state law did not allow the records to
be removed. <EMU>Id</EMU>. at 6. In effect, the Department
did not fail to comply with any laws
with respect to the petitioner, so the Board
found that it had no authority to order the
relief she sought.

<P20>&para; 13. In Fair Hearing No. B-10/22-581,
the petitioner received housing through
the transitional housing program administered
by the Economic Services Division of
the Department for Children and Families.
She received a notice to vacate from the
hotel where she was staying, alleging that
she used drugs. She denied using drugs
and requested that the Board order the
redaction of any reference to drug use
from her notice to vacate. The Board declined
to do so, noting that she had not
received any adverse determination or action
by the Division, which continued to
find petitioner eligible for services and assisted
her with finding another hotel. Fair
Hearing No. B-10/22-581, at 4 (Hum.
Servs. Bd. Dec. 9, 2022), https://outside.vermont.gov/agency/AHSHSB/Orders/Documents/2022/FH-B-10-22-581%20Order.pdf
[https://perma.cc/WAS8-63XV]. As
above, the Board referenced <EMU>Husrefovich</EMU>,
but relied primarily on the fact that the
state agency had not stopped providing
services to her, so there was no agency
action to appeal.

<P20>&para; 14. Other Board decisions citing <EMU>Husrefovich</EMU>
similarly do not support DAIL's
<Page 874>
contention that the Board has understood
its remedial powers to be so limited. See,
e.g., Fair Hearing No. M-10/23-822, at 6
(Hum. Servs. Bd. Feb. 9, 2024), https://outside.vermont.gov/agency/AHSHSB/Orders/Documents/2024/FH-M-10-23-822%20Order.pdf
[https://perma.cc/BY5R-DBV5]
(holding that the Board cannot make
order addressing moot situation); Fair
Hearing No. S-10/22-594, at 5-6 (Hum.
Servs. Bd. Jan. 10, 2023), https://outside.vermont.gov/agency/AHSHSB/Orders/Documents/2023/FH-S-10-22-594%20Order.pdf
[https://perma.cc/4DKM-UQDT]
(holding that the Board cannot order hotel
to do anything without agency action).

<P20>&para; 15. Today's clarification of the scope of
<EMU>Husrefovich</EMU> ensures that the Board can
carry out the Legislature's will. The Legislature
expressly authorized the Board to
"provide appropriate relief including retroactive
and prospective benefits." 3 V.S.A.
&sect; 3091(d). <EMU>Husrefovich</EMU> does not curtail
those powers; it merely clarifies, in accordance
with 3 V.S.A. &sect; 3091(a), that the
Board can act only where agency action
affects the petitioner's "situation." <EMU>Husrefovich</EMU>,
2006 VT 17, &para; 28, 179 Vt. 456, 898
A.2d 726.

<P20>&para; 16. In dismissing K.M.'s petition,
the Board concluded that his request
for injunctive relief was too vague to inform
DAIL as to the action to take in
order to comply with an injunction. The
Board correctly explained that an injunction
must be specific enough to inform the
parties "what they are called upon to do or
refrain from doing in order to comply with
the injunction." <EMU>Am. Trucking Ass'ns v.
Conway</EMU>, 152 Vt. 363, 374, 566 A.2d 1323,
1330 (1989) (quotation omitted); see also
V.R.C.P. 65(d) (providing that an order
granting an injunction "shall be specific in
terms").

<P20>&para; 17. We disagree with the Board's conclusion
that the relief sought here was too
vague. K.M.'s first petition to the Board
sought an order obligating "his services to
be restored to the amount allotted" to him.
During motion practice before the Board,
K.M. clarified that he was asking the
Board to find DAIL "in violation of federal
Medicaid law" and to order DAIL to provide
him the "community-based services to
which he is entitled." At a hearing, counsel
for K.M. explained the relief sought: "we
are asking for&mdash;we did ask for injunctive
and declaratory relief, but we're also asking
for prospective benefits." Later in the
hearing, counsel reiterated that K.M. is
"asking the Board to make an order for
[DAIL] to provide the benefits" to which
he is entitled. K.M. was clear in his repeated
requests seeking an order for
DAIL to provide the benefits to which he
is entitled.

<P20>&para; 18. The Board concluded that an "order
directing [DAIL] to provide services
when there is no staff available to perform
them falls short of informing [DAIL] of
what would be required for compliance."
We disagree. Compliance with such an order
is straightforward to determine. If the
Board orders DAIL to provide K.M. with
the services to which he is entitled, determining
compliance with that order requires
only a determination of whether he
has been provided those services. DAIL's
staffing challenges might make it more
difficult to comply with such an order, but
those challenges do not make the order
unclear.

<P20>&para; 19. Because we conclude that the
Board has the power to grant the relief
requested, we reverse the Board's dismissal
of the petition and remand for additional
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
Given our conclusion, we do not reach
K.M.'s remaining contention that the
Board's dismissal of his petition denied
him a fair hearing under the terms of 42
U.S.C. &sect; 1396a(a)(3).

<P20>&para; 1. Defendant Marshall Parker appeals
his convictions for aggravated sexual assault,
13 V.S.A. &sect; 3253(a)(8), and lewd and
lascivious conduct with a child, <EMU>id</EMU>. &sect; 2602.
First, defendant contends that the court's
exclusion of evidence that the complainant
&mdash;J.P., the son of defendant's girlfriend
&mdash;was engaging in other "concerning
behavior" at the time he first made the
allegations denied defendant a fair trial
and the right of confrontation. Second, he
argues that the State made prejudicial
statements during closing argument, including
violating the "golden rule" prohibition
on asking jurors to put themselves in
the complainant's shoes. We conclude that
the court properly excluded defendant's
proffered evidence and that the State did
<Page 878>
not commit reversible error in closing argument.
Accordingly, we affirm defendant's
convictions.

<CN>I. Factual Background

<P20>&para; 2. The following background is taken
from the trial court's orders and the appellate
record. Defendant was initially
charged in April 2018 with (1) aggravated
sexual assault of a child, 13 V.S.A.
&sect; 3253a(a)(8); (2) aggravated sexual assault,
<EMU>id</EMU>. &sect; 3253(a)(8); (3) lewd and lascivious
conduct with a child, <EMU>id</EMU>. &sect; 2602; (4)
sexual assault, <EMU>id</EMU>. &sect; 3252(a)(1); and (5)
lewd and lascivious conduct, <EMU>id</EMU>. &sect; 2601. The
State later dropped the final two charges
because it could not locate the alleged
victim, defendant's daughter B.P. The remaining
charges related to J.P.

<P20>&para; 3. Defendant began dating J.P.'s mother
when J.P. was about four or five years
old&mdash;approximately 2011. J.P. alleged that
defendant began sexually abusing him not
long thereafter and that the abuse continued
intermittently until the start of 2018.
In January 2018, mother received a call
from defendant telling her to "come get
your [expletive] rotten children." When
she arrived home, she found evidence of a
physical altercation, including a broken
door and chair. Mother left the home with
the children and filed for a relief-from-abuse
order against defendant. From then
on, defendant no longer lived with mother
or the children.

<P20>&para; 4. In March 2018, after defendant had
moved out, J.P. and mother passed by
defendant's truck while visiting Rutland.
Upon seeing the vehicle, J.P. soiled himself.<fnr1>
Later that day, J.P. told mother for
the first time that defendant had touched
him inappropriately. In the following
months, J.P. offered further details to
mother and to several school employees,
alleging that defendant had on various occasions
grabbed his genitals, penetrated
his anus, and made physical threats
against him to prevent him from telling
others. Defendant was arrested and
charged based on J.P.'s allegations.

<P20>&para; 5. Although J.P. was only eleven years
old at the time he first made the allegations,
he had a history of sexualized behavior,
including possessing pornography. In
advance of his first trial, defendant filed a
motion with the court seeking an order
prohibiting the State from introducing any
allegations of J.P.'s sexualized conduct.
Defendant argued that such evidence
"should be impermissible under Vermont's
Rape Shield Law as well as being unsupported
by evidence of a connection to defendant."
The State agreed, indicating that
it would not offer any evidence of sexualized
behavior by J.P. or "ask the jury to
infer from any such evidence that J.P. was
sexually abused by Defendant." The court
granted defendant's motion to exclude the
evidence.

<P20>&para; 6. However, at opening statement during
defendant's first trial, defense counsel
sought to use this information, stating,
"[w]hat the State didn't tell you is that
about five days before [J.P.] made that
disclosure, [mother] had been so concerned
about behavior that [J.P.] was engaged in,
looking at porn, engaging in inappropriate
actions." The State immediately objected,
and the court excused the jury for a bench
conference. Defendant argued that the evidence
was relevant to explain "how [J.P.]
would know about certain sexual acts," and
he suggested that the court's order only
excluded the admission of such evidence
for the purpose of showing that defendant
sexually assaulted J.P. The court ruled
that any reference to J.P.'s viewing of
<Page 879>
pornography was prohibited by the Rape
Shield Law, but it permitted defendant to
ask mother whether she was "concerned or
troubled about his behavior" in the days
leading up to his first accusation against
defendant without referencing any of his
"specific behaviors." Defendant then questioned
mother about whether J.P. "was
engaging in behavior [she] found very concerning,"
and she indicated that he was.
The jury ultimately acquitted defendant of
the first count but was unable to reach a
verdict as to counts two and three, and the
court declared a mistrial.

<P20>&para; 7. The State sought a second trial,
which was held in front of a different
judge. Prior to the trial, defendant moved
for a hearing under the Rape Shield Law,
13 V.S.A. &sect; 3255, regarding the admissibility
of documents showing that J.P. had
downloaded pornographic images. Distinct
from the first trial, defendant argued that
this information "raise[d] serious issues as
to [J.P.'s] knowledge of sexual acts despite
his age, and a motive as to why he would
accuse defendant of sexually assaulting
him soon after he was caught downloading
pornography." The State opposed the motion
and asked the court to preclude "any
references at trial to related matters, including
the notion that [J.P.] got in trouble
for engaging in risky behavior." The State
argued that the Rape Shield Law prohibited
any reference to J.P.'s sexual conduct,
including pornography, and that the attempt
to avoid the prohibition by referring
to "risky" behavior would cause the jury
"to be confused and to speculate about this
reference."

<P20>&para; 8. Following a hearing, the court denied
defendant's motion, concluding that
"evidence that J.P. may have obtained or
used pornography would be evidence of
sexual conduct and would therefore be
barred under Section 3255." The court also
rejected defendant's request that he be
permitted to refer to J.P.'s "risky" or "concerning"
behavior. The court found that
"there is no evidence that viewing pornography
is risky behavior, and there is no
evidence that J.P. was `in trouble' or being
threatened with discipline of any kind as a
result of this or any of his other more
overtly sexual conduct." Accordingly, the
court granted the State's motion to exclude
all such evidence because it was "not probative
at all" and any possible relevance
"would be far outweighed by the likelihood
that such evidence would simply confuse
and mislead the jury."

<P20>&para; 9. Defendant's second trial began in
April 2023. At the trial, the State elicited
testimony from J.P. that he decided to
come forward when he did "[b]ecause it
felt like the right moment to tell, because
at that time [defendant] was already in
trouble for" the January 2018 altercation.
Defendant responded by renewing his motion
to allow reference to J.P.'s "concerning"
behavior because the State had
opened the door by offering its own explanation
for the timing of the allegations.
The court again denied the motion because
there was no "nexus that's been demonstrated
at any point in time between his
disclosure [of the alleged sexual assault]
and that conduct." The jury ultimately
found defendant guilty on both remaining
counts.

<P20>&para; 10. Defendant filed motions for a judgment
of acquittal and for a new trial. In
the latter motion, defendant renewed his
argument that he should have been permitted
to submit evidence that J.P.'s "concerning"
behavior gave him a motive to
falsely accuse defendant. He argued that
refusing to allow the introduction of this
evidence violated his constitutional right to
confrontation. The court denied the motion,
reiterating its earlier conclusion and
stating that excluding this evidence did not
<Page 880>
deny defendant a fair trial. Defendant appealed.

<CN>II. Discussion

<P20>&para; 11. Defendant challenges his convictions
on two grounds. First, he argues that
the court's evidentiary rulings violated his
constitutional rights under the Due Process
and Confrontation Clauses. And second,
he argues that the State made prejudicial
statements in its closing argument,
including violating the "golden rule" by
effectively asking the jurors to put themselves
in J.P.'s place. Defendant asks that
this Court reverse his convictions and remand
for a new trial.

<CN>A. Evidentiary Rulings

<P20>&para; 12. Defendant argues that he should
have been permitted to question witnesses
about J.P.'s "concerning behavior," particularly
once the State presented a reason
why J.P. disclosed the abuse at the time
that he did. He concedes that any reference
to the pornography would be prohibited
under the Rape Shield Law, but he
argues that references to "concerning behavior"
are not prohibited and that this
line of questioning was essential to his
complete defense. He cites several of our
cases that have recognized a defendant's
right to confront a complaining witness
about "the presence of an ulterior motive
for ... making the accusations." <EMU>State v.
Cartee</EMU>, 161 Vt. 73, 76, 632 A.2d 1108, 1110
(1993); see <EMU>State v. Memoli</EMU>, 2011 VT 15,
&para; 24, 189 Vt. 237, 18 A.3d 567. Defendant
argues that preventing him from "fully
cross-examin[ing] J.P. and his mother
about what was going on just before his
disclosure" denied him the ability to "present
an alternative motive" for why J.P.
accused him, in violation of the Confrontation
Clause.<fnr2>

<P20>&para; 13. This Court ordinarily applies
a "deferential standard of review to a
trial court's evidentiary rulings." <EMU>State v.
Noyes</EMU>, 2021 VT 50, &para; 32, 215 Vt. 182, 260
A.3d 1132. The party challenging the
court's rulings bears the burden "to show
that the trial court abused its discretion"
and "[a]bsent such a showing, we will not
disturb a reasonable discretionary ruling
of the trial court, even if another court
might have reached a different conclusion."
<EMU>State v. Herring</EMU>, 2010 VT 106, &para; 4,
189 Vt. 211, 19 A.3d 81 (quotation omitted).
However, in criminal cases, "the broad discretion
of the trial court in evidentiary
matters is limited by [the] defendant's constitutional
right to confront witnesses
against him and by the demands of due
process." <EMU>In re A.B.</EMU>, 170 Vt. 535, 536, 740
A.2d 367, 369 (1999) (mem.) (quotation
omitted).

<P20>&para; 14. The Confrontation Clause
of the Sixth Amendment guarantees "the
right of an accused in a criminal prosecution
to be confronted with the witnesses
against him." <EMU>Delaware v. Van Arsdall</EMU>, 475
U.S. 673, 678, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d
674 (1986) (quotation omitted); see U.S.
Const. amend. VI ("In all criminal prosecutions,
the accused shall enjoy the right ...
to be confronted with the witnesses
against him.").<fnr3> This includes "not only the
<Page 881>
right to cross-examine adverse witnesses,
but also entitles a criminal defendant wide
latitude on cross-examination for the purpose
of showing who and what the witness
is, and that he is unreliable, prejudiced, or
biased." <EMU>Herring</EMU>, 2010 VT 106, &para; 8, 189 Vt.
211, 19 A.3d 81 (quotation and alteration
omitted). Nevertheless, the Clause is not
boundless; "[i]t gives the defendant an <EMU>opportunity</EMU>
for effective cross-examination,
not cross-examination that is effective in
whatever way, and to whatever extent, the
defense might wish." <EMU>Forty</EMU>, 2009 VT 118,
&para; 24, 187 Vt. 79, 989 A.2d 509 (quotation
omitted). Importantly, "[t]he right of confrontation
is not violated by the exclusion
of evidence that is otherwise inadmissible."
<EMU>Herring</EMU>, 2010 VT 106, &para; 8, 189 Vt. 211, 19
A.3d 81.

<P20>&para; 15. We conclude that the trial
court correctly excluded the proffered evidence
as inadmissible and that defendant
therefore has not made out a violation of
the Confrontation or Due Process Clauses.
As defendant concedes, any reference to
J.P.'s possession of pornography is prohibited
by the Rape Shield Law. Subject to
three exceptions not relevant here, Vermont's
Rape Shield Law excludes evidence
of "prior sexual conduct of the complaining
witness" in prosecutions for sexual assault
and other related crimes. 13 V.S.A.
&sect; 3255(a)(3). "Sexual conduct" is defined to
mean "any conduct or behavior relating to
sexual activities of the complaining witness."
<EMU>Id</EMU>. &sect; 3251(2). Possessing and viewing
pornography is "conduct or behavior
relating to sexual activities" and is therefore
covered by the Rape Shield Law.

<P20>&para; 16. Defendant cannot evade
the Rape Shield Law by euphemistically
referring to "concerning behavior" because
such evidence is neither logically nor legally
relevant. As we have recognized, the
Confrontation Clause "applies only to evidence
that is relevant and otherwise admissible
under the rules of evidence." <EMU>Forty</EMU>,
2009 VT 118, &para; 24, 187 Vt. 79, 989 A.2d
509. To meet the threshold to invoke the
Confrontation Clause, defendant must
show that the "evidence passes the tests of
logical and then of legal relevancy." <EMU>State
v. Patnaude</EMU>, 140 Vt. 361, 370, 438 A.2d 402,
405 (1981). Evidence is logically relevant if
it has any tendency to make a fact that is
"of consequence to the determination of
the action" any "more probable or less
probable than it would be without the evidence."
V.R.E. 401. Evidence is legally
relevant only if its probative value is not
"substantially outweighed by the danger of
unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or
misleading the jury, or by considerations
of undue delay, waste of time, or needless
presentation of cumulative evidence."
V.R.E. 403.

<P20>&para; 17. First, we agree with the
trial court that the proffered evidence is
not logically relevant because defendant
failed to present any evidence that J.P.
was ever in trouble for possessing pornography.
Defendant's theory of relevance is
that J.P. had a motive to fabricate the
allegations against defendant to distract
attention from his being in trouble for his
"concerning behavior."<fnr4> But as the court
<Page 882>
found, "there is no evidence that J.P. was
`in trouble' or being threatened with discipline
of any kind." To the contrary, when
asked whether J.P. was in trouble at the
first trial, mother insisted that he was not.
Defendant does not challenge the court's
finding, nor does he point to any evidence
in the record that J.P. was in trouble for
possessing pornography. Relevant evidence
must be "probative of the proposition
for which it is offered" and must "in
some degree advance[] the inquiry." <EMU>State
v. Raymond</EMU>, 148 Vt. 617, 622, 538 A.2d
164, 167 (1987) (quotation omitted). Absent
evidence of any causal link between J.P.'s
"concerning behavior" and his coming forward
with the allegations against defendant,
the proffered evidence is irrelevant
because there is no "connection or showing
that it makes a material fact `more probable
or less probable than it would be without
the evidence.'" <EMU>State v. LeClaire</EMU>, 2003
VT 4, &para; 14, 175 Vt. 52, 819 A.2d 719
(quoting V.R.E. 401).

<P20>&para; 18. Second, even if the evidence
was otherwise relevant, its probative value
would be substantially outweighed by the
likelihood of causing unfair prejudice and
misleading the jury. As one appellate court
stated under similar circumstances, "there
is little obvious connection" between being
"in trouble for possessing" pornography
and making a false allegation of sexual
assault. <EMU>State v. Marks</EMU>, 2011 UT App 262,
&para; 26, 262 P.3d 13, <EMU>superseded by rule on
other grounds as stated in State v. Steffen</EMU>,
2020 UT App 95, &para; 17 n.5, 468 P.3d 568.
Nor does the proffered evidence "reveal an
underlying hostility that would suggest an
independent motive to accuse [defendant]
falsely." <EMU>Id</EMU>. (quotation omitted). Further,
by limiting defendant's ability to inquire
into the specifics of J.P.'s sexual behavior,
the Rape Shield Law operates to limit any
probative value of the proffered evidence
and increase the risks of prejudice and
confusion. Oblique references to "concerning
behavior" could confuse or mislead the
jury about the underlying facts and could
lead to unfair prejudice by causing the
jury to make assumptions about J.P., impermissibly
basing "its decision on something
other than the established propositions
in the case." <EMU>State v. Amidon</EMU>, 2018
VT 99, &para; 21, 208 Vt. 360, 198 A.3d 27
(quotation omitted). We therefore conclude
that even if the evidence had some minimal
relevance, the court properly excluded it
under Rule 403.

<P20>&para; 19. The cases cited by defendant do
not change this conclusion. In <EMU>Cartee</EMU>, we
concluded that evidence that the complainant's
family had attempted to use the criminal
prosecution as a bargaining chip to
persuade the defendant to remain silent in
a separate investigation of the complainant's
stepfather's business was admissible
to show a potential motive to fabricate the
allegations. 161 Vt. at 77, 632 A.2d at 1111.
We noted the defendant's detailed "offer of
proof" as to these facts and concluded that
the court abused its discretion in finding
the evidence lacked probative value under
Rule 403 because it was "not a matter of
mere speculation." <EMU>Id</EMU>. at 74, 76, 632 A.2d
at 1109-10 (quotation marks omitted). And
in <EMU>Memoli</EMU>, we concluded that evidence of
the complainant's drug use was admissible
because it "directly related to whether
[the] complainant voluntarily inhaled drugs
and consented to sexual acts, both of which
were the prominent disputes at trial." 2011
VT 15, &para; 29, 189 Vt. 237, 18 A.3d 567. We
noted that the proffered evidence "held
strong probative value because it was critical
for the defense to demonstrate to the
jury why [the] complainant would consent
to the described sexual acts, and why [the]
<Page 883>
complainant would afterwards lie about
her consent." <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 28.

<P20>&para; 20. These cases are plainly distinguishable
based on the probative value
of the proffered evidence and the effects
of the Rape Shield Law. In both <EMU>Cartee</EMU>
and <EMU>Memoli</EMU>, the defendants introduced
evidence showing the chain of causation
between the proffered evidence and the
desired inference. Here, defendant never
introduced any evidence that J.P. was in
trouble for his "concerning behavior." Defendant
therefore lacked a critical piece of
the causal chain in his theory that J.P.
had a motive to fabricate the allegations.
Further, as discussed above, to the extent
that the evidence here retains any independent
probative value, the limitations
imposed by the Rape Shield Law change
the calculus under Rule 403 by limiting
the probative value and exacerbating the
risk of prejudice and confusion. Neither of
the cited cases applied the Rape Shield
Law,<fnr5> which we have recognized involves
evidence that is "unique among the varieties
of past conduct with which the law
customarily deals," given its "peculiarly
private ... character." <EMU>Patnaude</EMU>, 140 Vt.
at 376, 438 A.2d at 408. As we recognized
in <EMU>Cartee</EMU>, trial courts retain "wide latitude
to impose reasonable limits on such
cross-examination based on concerns
about, among other things, harassment,
prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness'
safety, or interrogation that is repetitive
or only marginally relevant." 161 Vt.
at 77, 632 A.2d at 1111 (quotation omitted).
This is precisely what the court did
here, in line with its authority under
Rules 401 and 403.

<CN>B. Closing Arguments

<P20>&para; 21. Defendant next argues that the
State made a series of "prejudicial and
improper statements" at closing argument
that deprived him of the right to a fair
trial. He points to three comments the
prosecutor made about the strength of the
defense's arguments, referring to "the
yarn that was just woven by defense counsel"
and arguing that the defense "just
doesn't add up" and "doesn't hold any
water." Defendant also highlights the following
statement:

<B22>Say those words, and also acknowledge
the difficult subject matter that you
have been presented with over the
course of the last two days. It's likely
that a few of you encounter in your day-to-day
lives the sexual abuse, the disruption
in the family life, that you've heard
about during this trial.

<B22>And when you're deliberating, when
you're thinking about this evidence, consider
the fear, the shame, the embarrassment;
those feelings of conflictive
loyalty that [J.P.] was experiencing, and
how him coming forward and saying
what happened is among the bravest
and the most difficult things that he
ever had to do in his young life.

<P00>Defendant argues that this statement violated
the "golden rule" by asking "the jury
to put themselves in J.P.'s shoes when
they deliberate." Defendant relies primarily
on our decision in <EMU>State v. Scales</EMU> to
argue that these statements showed a
"studied purpose to arouse the prejudices
of the jury," requiring reversal. 2017 VT 6,
&para; 30, 204 Vt. 137, 164 A.3d 652 (quotation
omitted).
<Page 884>

<P20>&para; 22. Defendant concedes that
he did not object to any of these statements
during trial and that the issue is
therefore not preserved for appellate review.
"When an issue has been forfeited
through a party's failure to raise it below
... we may consider it only under the
rubric of plain error." <EMU>State v. Yoh</EMU>, 2006
VT 49A, &para; 36, 180 Vt. 317, 910 A.2d 853;
see V.R.Cr.P. 52(b) ("Plain errors or defects
affecting substantial rights may be
noticed although they were not brought to
the attention of the court."). In arguing for
reversal based on prosecutorial statements,
"[t]o prove prejudice under the
plain error standard ... the defendant
must show that the prosecutor's remarks
were not merely improper, but that they
probed the outer boundaries of impermissible
conduct." <EMU>State v. Bubar</EMU>, 146 Vt. 398,
403, 505 A.2d 1197, 1201 (1985). Such comments
must be "manifestly and egregiously
improper before we will consider them
under the plain-error doctrine." <EMU>State v.
Hughes</EMU>, 158 Vt. 398, 401, 610 A.2d 559, 561
(1992) (quotation omitted); see also <EMU>State v.
Ayers</EMU>, 148 Vt. 421, 426, 535 A.2d 330, 333
(1987) ("We have rarely found plain error
in prosecutor's arguments to the jury even
where we have condemned the argument.").

<P20>&para; 23. We first conclude that the
prosecutor's statements impugning the
strength of the defense's case do not rise
to the level of plain error. Even where we
have disapproved of such statements, we
have repeatedly refused to reverse a conviction
absent a showing that the statements
affected a defendant's substantial
rights. For example, in <EMU>State v. Francis</EMU>,
the prosecutor insinuated that the defense
had "`put up a big smoke screen'" and
stated that "`it must be very difficult to
come up with a theory of defense'" given
the strength of the State's case. 151 Vt.
296, 298, 561 A.2d 392, 393 (1989). We
disapproved of the prosecutor's arguments,
stating that the prosecutor was "dangerously
close to promoting his personal belief
to persuade the jury" and that "[l]abeling
the defense summation as a `smoke screen'
mischaracterized what we find to be reasonable
and relevant arguments." <EMU>Id</EMU>. at
300, 561 A.2d at 394. However, because the
defendant did not challenge these statements
at trial, our review was limited, and
we concluded that the statements were
"not so egregious as to rise to the level of
plain error." <EMU>Id</EMU>. at 301, 561 A.2d at 395.
Similarly, in <EMU>Hughes</EMU>, we concluded under
plain-error review that the prosecutor's
statements that "defense counsel `was not
missing a trick' in questioning the victim,
`had the victim coming and going and tied
up right in circles[,]' and `has her confused'"
were not "manifestly or egregiously
improper" such that they "impaired defendant's
right to a fair trial." 158 Vt. at
402, 610 A.2d at 561 (brackets omitted).
Finally, in <EMU>Scales</EMU>, we characterized the
prosecutor's statement that the defense's
arguments were mere "`smoke and mirrors'"
as "not proper," but we concluded
that the statement "would not be grounds
for reversal" on its own, even where defense
counsel objected at trial. 2017 VT 6,
&para; 24, 204 Vt. 137, 164 A.3d 652.

<P20>&para; 24. While the statements here impugning
the defense's case were similarly improper,
they were not "manifestly or egregiously
improper," <EMU>Hughes</EMU>, 158 Vt. at 402,
610 A.2d at 561, and did not "probe[] the
outer boundaries of impermissible conduct,"
<EMU>Bubar</EMU>, 146 Vt. at 403, 505 A.2d at
1201. Defendant points to no similar case
where we have required a new trial based
on such statements, nor does he identify
any harm resulting from the statements.
As in our previous cases, we conclude that
"when viewed within the context of the
trial as a whole, including the substantial
evidence of the defendant's guilt, it cannot
be said that the remarks were so prejudicial
<Page 885>
to the defendant's interests as to require
reversal." <EMU>Id</EMU>. at 404, 505 A.2d at
1201.

<P20>&para; 25. Finally, we conclude that the prosecutor's
statements did not violate the
golden rule. In <EMU>Scales</EMU>, we described a
"golden rule argument" as one that "asks
jurors to place themselves in the position
of a party" and characterized such an argument
as being "universally condemned
because it encourages the jury to depart
from neutrality and to decide the case on
the basis of personal interest and bias
rather than on evidence." 2017 VT 6, &para; 28,
204 Vt. 137, 164 A.3d 652 (quotation omitted).
The prosecution in that case "ask[ed]
the jurors to put themselves in the place of
the child complainant" by stating:

<B22>As adults, no one would want to ever
come into court ... and say, okay, I'm
going to talk now about my first sexual
experience.... Imagine how difficult it
would be for an adult, and then put
yourself in the eyes of [a] twelve[-]year-old
child, and how difficult and challenging
it would have been for her, and for
her to come here, as well.

<P00><EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 26. We concluded that this statement
warranted reversal of the defendant's conviction
because it showed "a studied purpose
to arouse the prejudices of the jury."
<EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 30 (quotation omitted).

<P20>&para; 26. While defendant urges us to follow
<EMU>Scales</EMU>, the facts here are more analogous
to our decision in <EMU>State v. Bellanger</EMU>, 2018
VT 13, 206 Vt. 489, 183 A.3d 550. The
prosecutor in that case made two suspect
statements. First, commenting on the child
complainant's demeanor, the prosecutor
said, "`think about&mdash;most people can remember
being in fifth grade, or fourth
grade, having to do your very first oral
report, how incredibly stressful that is.
Most people remember it.'" <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 42. And
later, referring to the complainant's description
of sexual contact, the prosecutor
stated, "`[t]hat's exactly how you would
describe it if you were trying to figure it
out and you're eleven years old.'" <EMU>Id</EMU>. We
distinguished these statements from those
we disapproved of in <EMU>Scales</EMU> because "the
statements that [the] defendant challenges
as a golden rule violation do not overtly
invite jurors to place themselves in the
victim's position." <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 44. Rather, "when
considered within the context of the prosecutor's
surrounding argument," the statements
were better understood as "an invitation
to jurors to think about how difficult
it was for [the complainant] to testify." <EMU>Id</EMU>.
Because this speaks to the complainant's
credibility rather than inviting jurors to
place themselves in the complainant's position,
the statements did not violate the
golden rule. <EMU>Id</EMU>.; see also <EMU>Bubar</EMU>, 146 Vt. at
403-04, 505 A.2d at 1200-01 (concluding
that asking jury if it had "`given any
thought to how difficult it was for [the
complainant] to sit up here and do what
she did'" was "a permissible argument as
to credibility" and did not violate the golden
rule because it did not ask the jury to
"put themselves in the victim's place").

<P20>&para; 27. The same is true here. Unlike
the invitation in <EMU>Scales</EMU> to "put yourself
in the eyes of [a] twelve[-]year-old
child," 2017 VT 6, &para; 26, 204 Vt. 137, 164
A.3d 652, the prosecutor here merely
asked the jury to "consider the fear, the
shame, the embarrassment" and the "feelings
of conflictive loyalty that [J.P.] was
experiencing." The prosecutor did not ask
the jurors to place themselves in J.P.'s
shoes; rather, he highlighted the difficult
circumstances that J.P. faced in coming
forward and used that context to argue
that his testimony should be viewed as
credible. Following the quoted statement,
the prosecutor dedicated the next several
pages of the recorded transcript to discussing
J.P.'s testimony and the reasons
why the jury should credit that testimony.
Unlike <EMU>Scales</EMU> and other cases where we
have found reversible error in prosecutorial
<Page 886>
statements, there is no evidence of a
"studied purpose to arouse the prejudices
of the jury." <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 30. Rather, "when considered
within the context of the prosecutor's
surrounding argument," <EMU>Bellanger</EMU>,
2018 VT 13, &para; 44, 206 Vt. 489, 183 A.3d
550, the function of the challenged statements
to support J.P.'s credibility is clear.<fnr6>

<CN>III. Conclusion

<P20>&para; 28. For the reasons discussed above,
we reject defendant's challenges to his
convictions. First, the trial court did not
err in excluding reference to J.P.'s "concerning
behavior" because the evidence
was not relevant, and to the extent it had
any probative value, it was substantially
outweighed by the likelihood to mislead
the jury and cause undue prejudice. Second,
the prosecutor's statements during
closing argument did not violate the golden
rule and do not amount to plain error that
would require reversal of defendant's convictions.
Accordingly, we affirm.

<P20><EMU>Affirmed</EMU>.
<FN>
<fnt1> J.P. has a history of encopresis, particularly
when he is under stress. Mother indicated
that these issues had improved somewhat following
defendant's departure from the home.

<fnt2> In his briefs, defendant asserts violations of
both the Due Process and Confrontation
Clauses. However, his substantive arguments
focus only on the right to confront adverse
witnesses, and his references to due process
acknowledge the overlap in these rights. See,
e.g., <EMU>Chambers v. Mississippi</EMU>, 410 U.S. 284,
294, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973)
("The rights to confront and cross-examine
witnesses and to call witnesses in one's own
behalf have long been recognized as essential
to due process."). Because the substance of
defendant's claims is based in the right to
confront witnesses, we have analyzed them
solely under this rubric.

<fnt3> The Vermont Constitution similarly provides
that "in all prosecutions for criminal
offenses, a person hath a right ... to be
confronted with the witnesses." Vt. Const. ch.
I, art. 10. However, "[b]ecause defendant
does not distinguish how our analysis under
Article 10 of the Vermont Constitution should
differ from an analysis under the U.S. Constitution's
Confrontation Clause, we decline to
interpret the State Constitution in this case."
<EMU>State v. Forty</EMU>, 2009 VT 118, &para; 23 n.2, 187 Vt.
79, 989 A.2d 509.

<fnt4> Defendant alternatively argued below that
the evidence was relevant to show how J.P.
had knowledge of sexual acts. However, as
defendant concedes, the Rape Shield Law
bars defendant from inquiring into J.P.'s sexual
conduct. Absent the ability to inquire into
the sexual nature of J.P.'s "concerning behavior,"
this evidence would not reveal any alternative
basis for knowledge of sexual acts and
is therefore not relevant for this purpose.

<fnt5> The trial court in <EMU>Memoli</EMU> did invoke the
Rape Shield Law as one basis for its decision,
but we rejected its applicability because the
defendant was not seeking to introduce any
evidence of the complainant's prior sexual
conduct. 2011 VT 15, &para; 20, 189 Vt. 237, 18
A.3d 567. The Rape Shield Law thus did not
affect our analysis of the admissibility of the
evidence under the Rules of Evidence.

<fnt6> Our conclusion should not be read to encourage
the statements made by the prosecutor
during closing argument. We merely hold
that under the facts of the case and the applicable
standard of review, the statements do
not show an intent to arouse the prejudices of
the jury and therefore do not amount to reversible
error.

<P20>&para; 1. Neighbors<fnr1> appeal an order of the
Environmental Division affirming a subdivision
permit issued by the Westminster
Development Review Board (DRB) to applicant
Ranney Dairy Farm, LLC. Applicant
seeks to subdivide its property to add
two residential lots with frontage on Old
Codding Road in Westminster. The court
granted the permit based on its finding
that applicant had made a "threshold
showing" that it had the right to use Old
Codding Road. We conclude that the Environmental
Division erred in requiring only
a threshold showing of a right to use the
<Page 888>
road and in holding that it lacked jurisdiction
to determine the existence of an easement
or right-of-way in this context. Accordingly,
we reverse and remand to the
Environmental Division for a determination
of whether applicant has an easement
or right-of-way over Old Codding Road.

<CN>I. Background

<P20>&para; 2. The following descriptions come
from the record and the court's findings.
Applicant owns a 161.6-acre property in
Westminster, with frontage on Westminster
West Road, McKinnon Road, and Old
Codding Road. Applicant applied to the
Westminster DRB for a subdivision permit
in June 2021. The proposal would create
two residential lots of 6.8 and 13.5 acres,
while reserving the remainder of the land
as an agricultural lot. The residential lots
would have frontage solely along Old Codding
Road, which is a private road that
was discontinued in 1893. The closest public
road is McKinnon Road, which intersects
with Old Codding Road approximately
2000 feet from the boundary of the
closer proposed residential lot.

<P20>&para; 3. Under the Westminster Zoning Bylaws,
"no land development may be permitted
on lots that do not have either
frontage on a public road or public waters."
Town of Westminster Zoning Bylaws
&sect; 441(E)(1) (2017) [hereinafter Zoning
Bylaws], https://www.westminstervt.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/zoningbylaws.pdf
[https://perma.cc/E5MC-9VSM]. However,
"[w]ith the approval of the DRB,
access to such a road or waters can be
achieved by a permanent easement or
right-of-way." <EMU>Id</EMU>. The bylaws also specify
that "[t]he Subdivision of land constitutes
development ... and therefore must have
the required frontage or secure the approval
of the DRB for access by permanent
easement or right-of-way." <EMU>Id</EMU>.
&sect; 441(E)(2). This rule was enacted pursuant
to 24 V.S.A. &sect; 4412(3), which allows
land development "on lots that do not have
frontage either on a public road, class 4
town highway, or public waters" only
where "access through a permanent easement
or right-of-way has been approved"
by a local DRB.

<P20>&para; 4. Applicant does not have a deeded
right-of-way to the road, nor did its predecessors-in-interest.
Applicant acquired the
property from Harold and Joyce Ranney
in 2004, and as part of the purchase, a
portion of the land circumscribed by the
rest of the lot was subdivided and given to
the Ranneys' son, Philip. Philip Ranney
was given an easement to access the subdivision
through applicant's property, and he
did so via Old Codding Road, but his deed
similarly contains no right-of-way over the
road. The majority of residents who have
frontage on the road possess a deeded
right-of-way, but the court found that the
residents' practice of obtaining a deeded
right-of-way only began in the 1980s, when
a mortgage lender required one resident
to provide proof of such a right. At least
one other resident on the road, Jared Rolston,
does not have a deeded right-of-way
over the road, but still uses it to access his
property.

<P20>&para; 5. The Westminster DRB held a series
of hearings on the application and ultimately
granted the permit in January
2022. Neighbors appealed to the Environmental
Division, which held a two-day trial
in October 2023. As relevant to this appeal,
the principal issue during the trial was
whether applicant had a right-of-way over
the road. Both parties agreed that the
road was discontinued in the late 19th
century and that applicant's chain of title
is traceable to before the discontinuance.
However, the parties disputed whether the
road was ever formally laid out prior to
discontinuance. Applicant provided expert
testimony from Joseph DiBernardo, a land
surveyor, who testified that Old Codding
<Page 889>
Road was initially laid out and recorded in
the Westminster land records. Because the
road was laid out and later discontinued,
DiBernardo opined that applicant had a
residual common law right-of-way over the
road, inherited from its predecessors-in-interest.
He further testified that the
right-of-way clauses in other residents'
deeds were irrelevant because "by operation
of law, everybody that used that road
for access to their property [at the time of
discontinuance] still retains a private right-of-way."
On cross-examination, neighbors
introduced the 1833 record that purportedly
laid out Old Codding Road. As DiBernardo
agreed, the record showed only that
"a little bit over 400 feet" of road was laid
out, and applicant's property does not extend
to the portion of the road mentioned
in the record. Nevertheless, DiBernardo
maintained that applicant had a common
law right-of-way over the road following its
discontinuance because "[y]ou can't discontinue
a road ... that's not a town road."

<P20>&para; 6. The court issued its decision in
December 2023, affirming the permit and
concluding that applicant had "made the
threshold showing required for this court
to conclude that the Project has the right
to use Old Codding Road for access to the
Project." It found the threshold requirement
to be met because applicant's predecessors-in-interest
had previously used the
road, as had two neighbors&mdash;Philip Ranney
and Jared Rolston&mdash;who similarly
lacked deeded right-of-way access. The
court stated that it was unpersuaded by
the deeded right-of-way that other residents
possessed because this practice only
began in the 1980s. The court otherwise
refused to "interpret the laying out of Old
Codding Road and the documents associated
with this process or its discontinuance"
because it determined that its jurisdiction
under 4 V.S.A. &sect; 34 permitted it only to
consider "threshold showings of private
property interests." Neighbors appealed to
this Court.

<CN>II. Discussion

<P20>&para; 7. Neighbors' primary claim of error
on appeal is that the court improperly
declined to consider evidence about whether
the road was laid out. They argue that
this question is within the Environmental
Division's jurisdiction and is essential to
determining whether applicant has established
the necessary right-of-way. They
also suggest that by requiring only a
threshold showing of access to a public
road, the court improperly shifted the burden
of proof from the permit applicant to
those challenging the permit.

<P20>&para; 8. It is the trial court's province
as the finder of fact to "determine[] the
credibility of witnesses and weigh[] the
persuasive effect of evidence," and we will
not overturn its factual findings unless
"they are clearly erroneous." <EMU>In re Route
103 Quarry</EMU>, 2008 VT 88, &para; 4, 184 Vt. 283,
958 A.2d 694 (quotation omitted). Similarly,
we will uphold the court's legal conclusions
if they are "reasonably supported by
the findings." <EMU>In re Lathrop Ltd. P'ship I</EMU>,
2015 VT 49, &para; 21, 199 Vt. 19, 121 A.3d 630
(quotation omitted). However, we review
pure questions of law de novo. <EMU>In re Katzenbach
A250 Permit #7R1374-1</EMU>, 2022 VT
42, &para; 11, 217 Vt. 155, 287 A.3d 36.

<P20>&para; 9. We agree that the court erred
in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to
determine the existence of an easement or
evaluate evidence of whether the road was
laid out. As relevant here, the Legislature
has granted the Environmental Division
jurisdiction over (1) appeals of zoning decisions
under 10 V.S.A. chapter 220; and (2)
matters arising under the Vermont Planning
and Development Act, 24 V.S.A. chapter
117. See 4 V.S.A. &sect; 34(1)-(2). Appeals of
zoning matters are authorized exclusively
in the Environmental Division. See <EMU>Gould
v. Town of Monkton</EMU>, 2016 VT 84, &para; 10, 202
Vt. 535, 150 A.3d 1084. At issue here is a
provision of the Vermont Planning and
Development Act&mdash;and a municipal bylaw
<Page 890>
enacted pursuant to that provision&mdash;that
permits "[l]and development" only with
frontage on a public road or with "access
through a permanent easement or right-of-way."
24 V.S.A. &sect; 4412(3); see Zoning Bylaws
&sect; 441(E)(1). As discussed above, subdivision
of property qualifies as "land development"
under the Westminster Zoning
Bylaws and therefore requires compliance
with &sect; 4412(3). See Zoning Bylaws
&sect; 441(E)(2). To issue a subdivision permit,
a reviewing court necessarily must decide
whether the applicant has frontage on a
public road or, alternatively, possesses a
permanent easement or right-of-way.
While these are questions of private-property
rights, that is what the statute and
the bylaws require. Because these questions
arise directly under 24 V.S.A. chapter
117 and related appeals arise under 10
V.S.A. chapter 220, this matter is squarely
within the Environmental Division's jurisdiction.
See 4 V.S.A. &sect; 34(1)-(2).

<P20>&para; 10. Our precedents do not foreclose
the Environmental Division from deciding
questions of private property rights where
directly required by statute and bylaw. We
recently recognized that "[w]hether the requirements
for an easement are satisfied is
the type of private-property dispute that
the Environmental Division lacks jurisdiction
to resolve." <EMU>In re DJK, LLC WW &
WS Permit</EMU>, 2024 VT 34, &para; 26, ___ Vt. ___,
323 A.3d 911. However, <EMU>DJK</EMU> is distinguishable
because the statute that created
the Environmental Division's jurisdiction
in that case did not directly require an
evaluation of the existence of an easement;
rather, the existence of an easement was
raised in the context of a neighbor's takings
claim that was auxiliary to the wastewater-permit
decision on appeal. Here, the
existence of an easement is the very question
that the Environmental Division is
required to decide in determining whether
to grant the permit. Where a proposed
project is not located on a public road,
&sect; 4412 and the Westminster Zoning Bylaws
require a determination of whether
the applicant has "a permanent easement
or right-of-way" that provides access to a
public road. As discussed above, &sect; 4412 is
in chapter 117 of Title 24 and is thus
within the Environmental Division's jurisdiction.
See 4 V.S.A. &sect; 34(2). Moreover,
appeals of DRB decisions are solely authorized
in the Environmental Division and
provide a separate basis for jurisdiction.
See 24 V.S.A. &sect; 4471(a); 4 V.S.A. &sect; 34(1).
Because such appeals require a determination
of the existence of an easement or
right-of-way, it would be contrary to the
plain statutory language to conclude that
the Environmental Division lacks jurisdiction
over this question. We therefore hold
that the Environmental Division has jurisdiction
to determine the existence of an
easement in this context, notwithstanding
any suggestions to the contrary in <EMU>DJK</EMU> or
prior cases.<fnr2>

<P20>&para; 11. We also agree with neighbors
that the court erred in requiring only a
"threshold showing" of a "right to use"
the road, rather than determining whether
<Page 891>
applicant had met the requirements in
the bylaws for a subdivision permit. By
limiting its inquiry in this way, the court
effectively shifted the burden of proof
away from the permit applicant to those
challenging the permit. This decision was
exacerbated by the court's jurisdictional
conclusions, leaving neighbors with no realistic
opportunity to contest the permit.
Once applicant provided a threshold showing
of a right to use the road, the court
refused to consider the proffered evidence
regarding the laying out of the road.
Neighbors were thus left with no ability
to introduce evidence to rebut the court's
finding of a threshold showing, converting
the "threshold showing" into a conclusive
determination.

<P20>&para; 12. Nowhere in the statutory
scheme or the town's bylaws is such a
burden shifting authorized. Instead, as we
have repeatedly recognized elsewhere, it is
the applicant for a zoning permit that has
the burden of proof with respect to the
essential elements of the permit. See <EMU>In re
Mutschler</EMU>, 2006 VT 43, &para; 9, 180 Vt. 501,
904 A.2d 1067 (mem.) ("The permit applicant
bears the burden of providing evidence
to support a finding with respect to
each of the five criteria."); <EMU>In re Bjerke
Zoning Permit Denial</EMU>, 2014 VT 13, &para; 18,
195 Vt. 586, 93 A.3d 82 ("As the party
seeking to reverse the City's denial of his
permit application, applicant had the burden
of proving that his application actually
complied with the ordinance."). And in determining
whether a road was laid out, the
burden of proof is on "the proponent of the
road" to "present evidence that the town
recognized or approved the road as a public
highway." <EMU>Daiello v. Town of Vernon</EMU>,
2022 VT 32, &para; 53, 217 Vt. 1, 282 A.3d 894.
Moreover, on appeal from a DRB decision,
the Environmental Division is required to
hold a "trial de novo," deciding "all questions
of law or fact as to which review is
available." V.R.E.C.P. 5(g). Under 24
V.S.A. &sect; 4412(3) and the Westminster Zoning
Bylaws, one such question of law or
fact is the existence of a "permanent easement
or right-of-way" providing access to
a public road. Requiring only a threshold
showing with respect to this element of the
permit was thus inconsistent with the statutory
scheme, the Environmental Rules,
and our precedents.<fnr3>

<P20>&para; 13. Finally, we note that the
court's errors were not harmless because
the evidence of whether the road was
properly laid out is necessary to a determination
of whether applicant has the required
easement or right-of-way, and this
determination has yet to be made. A
"threshold showing" is not such a determination.
We have recognized that "when a
public road is opened adjacent to private
property, the owner of the abutting property
obtains a right to access the public
road by operation of law, and when a
public road is discontinued or abandoned,
the abutting landowner retains the private
right of access." <EMU>Okemo Mountain, Inc. v.</EMU>
<Page 892>
<EMU>Town of Ludlow</EMU>, 171 Vt. 201, 207, 762 A.2d
1219, 1225 (2000) (citation omitted). Such a
right of access "runs with the land through
the chain of title." <EMU>Daiello</EMU>, 2022 VT 32,
&para; 72, 217 Vt. 1, 282 A.3d 894. Thus, applicant's
claim is based on the chain of title
running since the road was discontinued in
1893. As applicant points out, neighbors
have stipulated to the fact that applicant's
legal title to its land goes back to prior to
1893 when the road was discontinued.
However, the 1893 discontinuance only
created a private right of access if the road
was in fact a public road at that time. See
<EMU>Okemo</EMU>, 171 Vt. at 207, 762 A.2d at 1225
("The right of access has two requirements:
(1) the person claiming the right
must own land that abuts the road, and (2)
the road must be a public road." (emphasis
omitted)). Thus, to determine whether applicant
had a residual right-of-way, the
court necessarily had to determine whether
the road was laid out as a public road
prior to 1893. Alternatively, applicant
could seek to prove the existence of an
easement or right-of-way through other
means.

<P20>&para; 14. For the reasons discussed above,
we reverse and remand to the Environmental
Division for a determination of
whether applicant has established the existence
of an easement or right-of-way over
Old Codding Road.<fnr4> On remand, the Environmental
Division has jurisdiction to inquire
into whether the road was ever laid
out, and applicant bears the burden of
establishing that it possesses an easement
or right-of-way.

<P20><EMU>Reversed and remanded</EMU>.
<FN>
<fnt1> Appellants are seven neighbors of the proposed
subdivision: Daniel Deitz, Steven Goulas,
Veronica Goulas, Martha Moscrip, Nancy
Pike, Michael Sylvester, and Teresa Sylvester.

<fnt2> Aside from <EMU>DJK</EMU>, our prior decisions have
been more circumspect in articulating limits
on the Environmental Division's jurisdiction
to consider private property rights. In <EMU>In re
Woodstock Community Trust & Housing Vermont
PRD</EMU>, we recognized that "[t]he parties
agree that the Environmental Division does
not have jurisdiction to determine private
property rights," but we made no such holding.
2012 VT 87, &para; 40, 192 Vt. 474, 60 A.3d
686. And in <EMU>Nordlund v. Van Nostrand</EMU>, while
we concluded that the Environmental Division
lacked jurisdiction to decide a purely
private property dispute, we did so because
"there [was] no violation of an existing zoning
decision" and therefore no jurisdiction under
24 V.S.A. &sect; 4470(b). 2011 VT 79, &para; 17, 190 Vt.
188, 27 A.3d 340. Thus, neither case set out a
general rule that the Environmental Division
can never decide matters of private property
rights.

<fnt3> The Environmental Division cited to its decision
in <EMU>In re Leiter Subdivision Permit</EMU>, No.
85-4-07 Vtec (Vt. Env't Ct. Jan. 2, 2008)
[https://perma.cc/W5LL-Z6VD], to support its
conclusion that a threshold showing was the
only requirement here. <EMU>Leiter</EMU>, in turn, cites to
numerous Environmental Division decisions
recognizing that applicants have only a
"threshold burden" to show "some evidence
of title or an interest in the property to be
developed." <EMU>Id</EMU>. at 4. This interpretation of the
statute was intended to maintain the "delicate
balance between the evaluation of this initial
threshold burden and the court's jurisdictional
limitations." <EMU>Id</EMU>. However, where, as here,
a question of private property rights is statutorily
assigned to the Environmental Division's
jurisdiction, the court's jurisdictional
limitations are not implicated, and the court
is required to make complete determinations
as to the statutory elements. We otherwise
express no view as to the continued validity of
this line of Environmental Division cases.

<fnt4> Because we reverse on the question of the
Environmental Division's jurisdiction, we do
not reach neighbors' alternative arguments
that applicant failed to make a threshold
showing and that the Town of Westminster
improperly participated in the proceedings.

[MT]
<CN><EMBU>ENTRY ORDER</EMBU>

<P20>&para; 1. Defendant appeals the trial court's
decision to hold him without bail. He argues
that the trial court erred in concluding
that the evidence of guilt of kidnapping
was great. In the alternative, he argues
that the trial court abused its discretion by
declining to nonetheless release him. We
affirm.

<P20>&para; 2. A five-count information charged
defendant with one count of kidnapping,
one count of aggravated domestic assault,
and three counts of domestic assault.<fnr1> For
the kidnapping charge, the information alleged
that defendant knowingly restrained
another person with the intent to inflict
bodily injury upon the restrained person
or place the restrained person in fear that
any person will be subjected to bodily injury.
That charge carries a maximum sentence
<Page 895>
of life imprisonment. 13 V.S.A.
&sect; 2405(b). The State moved to hold defendant
without bail pursuant to 13 V.S.A.
&sect; 7553, which allows a person to be held
without bail if the offense is "punishable
by life imprisonment" and "the evidence of
guilt is great."

<P20>&para; 3. The trial court then held a
weight-of-the-evidence hearing and applied
a &sect; 7553 analysis: "The evidence of guilt is
great if substantial, admissible evidence,
taken in the light most favorable to the
State and excluding modifying evidence,
can fairly and reasonably show defendant
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt." <EMU>State v.
Blow</EMU>, 2020 VT 106, &para; 3, 213 Vt. 651, 251
A.3d 517 (mem.) (quotation omitted). If the
State meets this initial burden, a presumption
against release arises, and "the burden
shifts to the defendant to persuade the
court to exercise its discretion to set bail
or conditions of release." <EMU>State v. Auclair</EMU>,
2020 VT 26, &para; 16, 211 Vt. 651, 229 A.3d
1019 (mem.). The court must exercise its
discretion in determining whether to impose
bail or conditions of release and in
doing so may consider the factors in 13
V.S.A. &sect; 7554(b). <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 3. These factors
include:

<B22>[T]he nature and circumstances of the
offense charged; the weight of the evidence
against the accused; the accused's
family ties, employment, character and
mental condition, length of residence in
the community, record of convictions,
and record of appearance at court proceedings
or of flight to avoid prosecution
or failure to appear at court proceedings.

<P00>13 V.S.A. &sect; 7554(b)(2). The court may also
consider "[r]ecent history of actual violence
or threats of violence ... as bearing
on the character and mental condition of
the accused." <EMU>Id</EMU>.

<P20>&para; 4. The State introduced the following
evidence at the weight-of-the-evidence
hearing. The charges stemmed from an
incident between defendant and complainant,
his then-girlfriend. On August 29,
2024, defendant had been "agitated all day,
wanting to fight" and arrived at complainant's
house at 7:00 p.m. After eating dinner
together, defendant got upset when
complainant "abused" his dog by giving it
less leftover bacon than complainant's dog.
Complainant stated that this was when the
night became "tortuous." She described
being followed and cornered by defendant
in each room she went into and not being
let out of the bedroom. Complainant attempted
to leave the house twice and told
defendant that she wanted to leave but
"every time I tr[ied] to leave, he [threw]
me away from the door, slam[med] the
door." When complainant asked "why are
you still here? What are we still doing?"
defendant replied, "because I'm not fucking
done with you" and "you'll know when
I'm fucking done." Complainant estimated
that hours elapsed between her attempts
to leave and said she was "basically held
prisoner in my home for hours on end."
She stated that she was only able to "bolt"
out the back door at 3:00 a.m.

<P20>&para; 5. Complainant described multiple acts
of violence throughout the night. She described
that defendant "kept me&mdash;he
wouldn't let me leave and he just kept
grabbing the back of my head, holding me
down with his knee on my neck ... spitting
on me, trying to burn me with cigarettes."
She described that defendant
pulled her hair which "fe[lt] like he [was]
ripping my scalp off my head." At one
point, when defendant had backed complainant
against the sink in the kitchen,
complainant described that she grabbed a
knife to get him away from her. Defendant
then grabbed her by the arm and told her,
"I will fucking kill you if you don't put that
knife back." Complainant stated that when
she put the knife down, defendant threw
<Page 896>
her to the ground, pressed his knee into
her throat for minutes, held his fist over
her, and yelled "I'll kill you, you fucking
cunt" and "if you were a fucking man, I
would fucking kill you right now." At one
point during the evening, defendant was
attempting to burn complainant with a cigarette
and complainant was attempting to
hold him away when the cigarette dropped
to the ground. Complainant yelled "it's
burning" and defendant responded, "I
hope we fucking burn." Complainant also
recounted that after her second attempt to
leave, defendant grabbed her, threw her
down, and poured his dirty bong water on
her. Complainant described it as "hours of
nonstop, slow burn torture."

<P20>&para; 6. Complainant stated that she went to
take a shower after defendant poured the
bong water on her. Coming out of the
shower, complainant observed that defendant
was not in the kitchen and instead,
was down the hallway by the guest bedroom.
She took the opportunity to escape
through the kitchen and mudroom, run
through her yard, and lie down to hide in
the brush under the power lines near her
house. Complainant saw a spotlight and
heard defendant yelling her name and
"come out, come out, wherever you are."
After seeing defendant use the spotlight,
she crawled further into the power line
area. Complainant described that it was
the scariest thing she had ever experienced,
and she felt like she "was being
hunted."

<P20>&para; 7. The State presented evidence that
defendant had previously been abusive and
physically controlling in his relationship
with complainant and other women in his
life. Complainant recounted that defendant
often grabbed her by the jaw or her hair,
had headbutted her in the forehead, and
had thrown her across a wrought iron
table. She also stated that this was not the
first time that defendant had prevented
her from leaving her house while also assaulting
her. Defendant's former partner,
and the mother of his child, testified that
defendant had been physically abusive towards
her more than once a month, describing
that "he would back you into
something and corner you and then grab
you, typically by the face.... There were
many, many times I had bruises along
cheekbones and along the bottom of my
jaw and on my neck." She also stated that
defendant had engaged in "controlling" behavior
describing that "I wasn't allowed
really to leave the house without his permission."
Defendant's former partner also
stated that she had "personally witnessed
[defendant] not abid[ing] by court orders"
and was concerned that he would not do so
in this case either. Complainant's adult
daughter also testified that defendant
"would become violent if we&mdash;both of us,
my mother and I&mdash;did not do exactly as he
wanted" and that defendant would "get in
my face as well as my mother's face ...
screaming very, very loud [and] grab her
by the arms if she wasn't looking at him."
The daughter also stated that defendant
had "spit in my face before" and that if
defendant was released, she "would be
scared for my safety, as well as my mother's,"
and defendant's former partner who
testified.

<P20>&para; 8. The court heard testimony from an
individual who stated that he would be
willing to allow defendant to move his
camper onto the individual's property and
would help defendant by picking up groceries
and other basics if a curfew was
imposed. Defendant also presented testimony
that multiple members of defendant's
family live in Vermont and just
across the New Hampshire border. The
court also reviewed defendant's criminal
record which included a conviction for a
violation of an abuse-prevention order in
2012, three simple assaults in 1997, 2007,
and 2008, and a probation violation in 1999.
<Page 897>

<P20>&para; 9. Based on this evidence, the court
concluded that the State had met its burden
of demonstrating that the evidence of
guilt was great. The court concluded that
there was sufficient evidence "to establish
that ... [complainant] was indeed unlawfully
restrained, and that she was in reasonable
fear that she would be subject to
more than bodily injury.... And the purpose
of the restraint was to ... continually
torture and torment her." The court declined
to release defendant because it
found that several factors weighed against
a discretionary grant of release. The court
first considered defendant's criminal record
including convictions for one felony
and multiple misdemeanors, no violations
of probation or parole, and some violations
of court orders.<fnr2> The court noted that defendant
had shown that he would have a
place to park his camper to stay and an
individual willing to help defendant if a
curfew was imposed. However, the court
also considered defendant's history and
"pattern of rage and anger and of acting
out in violent, threatening, and coercive
ways towards women in his life" and stated
it was "completely unpersuaded that releasing
[defendant] at this point would be
safe" and that "the evidence establishes
that [defendant] loses self-control completely
and ... could not comply" with an
order that would require him to stay away
from the complainant and the other women
who testified at the hearing. Therefore, the
court granted the State's motion to hold
defendant without bail.

<P20>&para; 10. On appeal, defendant argues that
the State failed to present a prima facie
case of kidnapping, and therefore did not
meet its burden under &sect; 7553 to demonstrate
that the evidence of guilt is great.
See <EMU>State v. Crawford</EMU>, 2018 VT 119, &para; 6,
208 Vt. 662, 200 A.3d 1086 (mem.) (describing
that to demonstrate evidence of guilt is
great and hold defendant without bail,
State must provide "evidence sufficient to
make out a prima facie case against the
defendant"). Defendant further argues
that the court abused its discretion by not
releasing defendant.

<P20>&para; 11. We first address defendant's
argument that the State failed to present a
prima facie case for kidnapping. To establish
a prima facie case for kidnapping the
State must establish "substantial, admissible
evidence that is legally sufficient to
sustain a verdict of guilty on each element
of the crime charged." <EMU>State v. Hugerth</EMU>,
2018 VT 89, &para; 6, 208 Vt. 657, 194 A.3d 1189
(mem.) (quotation omitted). A person commits
the crime of kidnapping if the person
"knowingly restrains another person with
the intent to ... inflict bodily injury upon
the restrained person or place the restrained
person ... in fear that any person
will be subjected to bodily injury." 13
V.S.A. &sect; 2405(a)(1)(C). In <EMU>State v. Alexander</EMU>,
we explained that "kidnapping is a
double intent crime." 173 Vt. 376, 384, 795
A.2d 1248, 1255 (2002). Specifically, the
State "must prove that defendant both
knowingly restrained the victim <EMU>and</EMU> intended
to inflict bodily injury ... to prove
... kidnapping." <EMU>Id</EMU>.

<P20>&para; 12. Defendant concedes that there is
sufficient evidence for a jury to find unlawful
restraint but argues that "[t]here is no
evidence that [defendant] was committing
this unlawful restraint <EMU>for the purpose</EMU> of
committing an assault." Instead, defendant
argues that because the alleged assaults
happened "after the restraint had been
underway for a significant time-period ...
there is no way to infer that the intent of
the original restraint was to injure [complainant]
<Page 898>
or make her scared of serious
injury."

<P20>&para; 13. This Court reviews &sect; 7553
decisions based on the record below, <EMU>State
v. Ford</EMU>, 2015 VT 127, &para; 8, 200 Vt. 650, 130
A.3d 862 (mem.), but "independently determines
whether the standard has been
met." <EMU>State v. Orost</EMU>, 2017 VT 110, &para; 5, 206
Vt. 657, 179 A.3d 763 (mem.).

<P20>&para; 14. In <EMU>Alexander</EMU>, we described
that the element of intent "is rarely proved
by direct evidence; it must be inferred
from a person's acts and proved by circumstantial
evidence." 173 Vt. at 386, 795 A.2d
at 1256 (quotation omitted). Furthermore,
a "jury [is] entitled to infer both the intent
to restrain and the intent to do serious
bodily injury from the same facts." <EMU>Id</EMU>. at
385, 795 A.2d at 1255. When a defendant
uses more force than necessary simply to
effectuate the restraint, a jury can reasonably
conclude that a kidnapping was for
the specific purpose of inflicting bodily injury
or fear of injury. <EMU>Id</EMU>. at 386, 795 A.2d
at 1256.

<P20>&para; 15. Defendant argues that because
the evidence indicates that the assaults
occurred only "when [complainant]
attempted to leave or fight [defendant]," a
jury could not reasonably infer that the
unlawful restraint was for the purpose of
committing an assault. There was sufficient
evidence for a jury to infer defendant
restrained complainant to assault her.
Complainant described that, in addition to
"cornering her" in multiple rooms, defendant
also grabbed complainant by her hair
to the point that she "fe[lt] like he [was]
ripping my scalp off my head," spit on her,
attempted to burn her with a cigarette,
threw her to the ground, pressed his knee
into her throat for multiple minutes, and
poured his dirty bong water on her. A jury
could reasonably conclude that the described
assaults involved more force than
necessary to effectuate the restraint or
were unconnected to maintaining the restraint
and, therefore, that the defendant
restrained complainant for the purpose of
assaulting her. See <EMU>Alexander</EMU>, 173 Vt. at
386, 795 A.2d at 1256.

<P20>&para; 16. In addition, a jury could reasonably
conclude that defendant restrained complainant
for the purpose of assaulting her
based on the statements he allegedly made
during the evening. Complainant described
that defendant grabbed her by the arm
and told her, "If you don't put the knife
down, I will kill you" and when complainant
complied, defendant threw her to the
ground, pressed his knee into her throat,
held his fist over her, and yelled "I'll kill
you, you fucking cunt" and "if you were a
fucking man, I would fucking kill you right
now." While these statements were made
after complainant brandished a knife
against defendant, they were also made
after complainant had dropped the knife.
In addition, when complainant asked "why
are you still here? What are we still doing?"
defendant replied, "because I'm not
fucking done with you" and "you'll know
when I'm fucking done." A jury could reasonably
infer an intent to restrain for the
purpose of inflicting injury or fear of injury
from these direct statements made by
defendant.

<P20>&para; 17. Defendant argues that a kidnapping
can occur only if the "intent of the
<EMU>original</EMU> restraint was to injure [complainant]
or make her scared of serious injury."
(Emphasis added.) Defendant accurately
states that our case law requires us to
construe the kidnapping statute narrowly.
See <EMU>State v. Goodhue</EMU>, 2003 VT 85, &para; 21,
175 Vt. 457, 833 A.2d 861 (explaining "[i]t
is appropriate to narrowly construe a statute
that carries a potential sentence of life
imprisonment"). However, the plain language
of the statute contains no such restriction.
<EMU>State v. Rougeau</EMU>, 2019 VT 18,
<Page 899>
&para; 18, 209 Vt. 535, 209 A.3d 599 (explaining
"[w]e interpret statutes according to their
plain language"). Section 2405(a)(1) states
that the intent must exist "with" the restraint
and makes no indication that the
intent must be "at the beginning of" the
restraint.

<P20>&para; 18. In this case, a jury could reasonably
conclude that defendant's intent to
restrain complainant occurred simultaneously
with defendant's intent to inflict
injury or fear of injury on complainant.
The facts indicate that the restraint began
shortly after 7:00 p.m. and ended around
3:00 a.m. As stated above, during that near
eight-hour period, defendant grabbed complainant
violently by her hair, spit on her,
attempted to burn her with a cigarette,
threw her to the ground, pressed his knee
into her throat for multiple minutes while
threatening her, and poured his dirty bong
water on her. The substantial overlap between
the extended restraint and the multiple
assaults provides enough evidence for
a jury to reasonably conclude that defendant
both intended to restrain complainant
and that at some point during or before
that restraint, formed the intent to restrain
complainant to inflict bodily injury
on her.

<P20>&para; 19. We conclude that, looking at the
evidence in the light most favorable to the
State, the State has presented a prima
facie case for kidnapping that includes
both the intent to restrain and the intent
to restrain for the purpose of committing
an assault or placing the complainant in
fear of an assault. Therefore, because the
statutory requirements in 13 V.S.A. &sect; 7553
were met, the trial court appropriately
shifted the burden "to the defendant to
persuade the court to exercise its discretion
to set bail or conditions of release."
<EMU>Auclair</EMU>, 2020 VT 26, &para; 16, 211 Vt. 651, 229
A.3d 1019.

<P20>&para; 20. We now turn to defendant's second
argument that the trial court abused its
discretion in failing to release defendant.
Defendant argues that the trial court
should have released defendant "on a strict
curfew because he is neither a flight risk
nor a risk to public safety" and because
"the trial court distorted the record and
did not seriously consider [defendant's] evidence
or arguments."

<P20>&para; 21. We review the trial court's
denial of discretionary bail in this circumstance
for an abuse of discretion. <EMU>Ford</EMU>,
2015 VT 127, &para; 8, 200 Vt. 650, 130 A.3d
862. "In exercising its discretion to release
a defendant, the trial court may look to the
factors listed in &sect; 7554." <EMU>Id</EMU>. &para; 10. The
court's "discretion is broad, but the bail
decision cannot be arbitrary." <EMU>Id</EMU>.

<P20>&para; 22. The court acted well within its
discretion here in declining to release defendant
under conditions. The court
weighed the nature and circumstances of
the offenses charged, recounting the
events on August 29 and 30. The court
considered the danger posed by defendant
to the women who testified and the testimony
concerning defendant's character
and mental condition as described in the
testimony of the three women who had
lived with him. The court further weighed
the evidence of defendant's prior convictions,
the most recent of which was in
2012. The court recognized that defendant
had an offer from a neighbor for a place to
stay but determined that this did not outweigh
the other considerations.

<P20>&para; 23. Defendant argues that the
court abused its discretion because defendant
"is neither a flight risk nor a risk to
public safety." However, defendant supports
this argument by merely reciting the
evidence presented to and considered by
the court at the weight-of-the-evidence
hearing. The record indicates that the
court heard and addressed whether defendant
<Page 900>
was a flight risk by considering testimony
about the location of defendant's
family and that defendant had an appropriate
location to stay. The court weighed this
along with other factors that did not favor
release. The court determined that defendant
was a risk to public safety by looking
at his criminal record and the testimony of
the three women who knew and had lived
with defendant and concluding that it was
"completely unpersuaded that releasing
[defendant] at this point would be safe"
and that it was "completely unpersuaded
that he would be able ... to stay away
from [complainant] and the other women
who testified."

<P20>&para; 24. Defendant also argues that
the court did not fully provide defendant
with an opportunity to be heard. Defendant
supports this argument by contrasting
the substantial time given to the State
with the court directing the defendant to
"move on" because "time [was] very short"
when defendant "attempted to elicit additional
details about the livability of the
motorhome." However, defendant fails to
demonstrate what additional evidence he
would have offered and how that would
have altered the court's decision. When
asking the defendant to "move on," the
court stated that defendant had "already"
established that the motorhome was livable
and later stated that it was "completely
persuaded that [this wasn't a haphazard
motor home because] it's obviously a very
comfortable looking residence." See <EMU>State
v. Hardy</EMU>, 2008 VT 119, &para; 10, 184 Vt. 618,
965 A.2d 478 (mem.) (explaining that "so
long as the trial court gives a defendant an
opportunity to be heard, the trial court's
discretion is extremely broad" (quotation
omitted)).

<P20>&para; 25. Defendant presents conclusory
statements that the court abused its
discretion because the court "distorted the
record and failed to account for the fact
that there was no physical evidence to
corroborate the claims" made in the video
interview of claimant which afforded defendant
no opportunity for cross-examination.
Defendant specifically points to the
court's statement that the unlawful restraint
occurred for "twenty-four hours
... perhaps less than that, maybe twelve
hours" when the evidence indicates that
the restraint lasted less than eight hours.
However, defendant concedes that "this is
certainly a substantial period" and presents
no argument or authority on why
considering a twelve- or twenty-four-hour
restraint as opposed to an eight-hour restraint
indicates arbitrariness or an abuse
of discretion. Similarly, defendant does not
present what the defense would have elicited
during cross-examination that would
have indicated arbitrariness or abuse of
discretion on the part of the court. See
<EMU>State v. Blow</EMU>, 2015 VT 143, &para; 12 n.1, 201
Vt. 633, 135 A.3d 672 (mem.) (describing
presumption in favor of incarceration subsequently
"shifts the burden to the defendant
to show that he is bailable")

<P20>&para; 26. We conclude that the record supports
the court's conclusion that the State
met its burden under 13 V.S.A. &sect; 7553 to
demonstrate that the evidence of guilt is
great by providing substantial, admissible
evidence that, taken in the light most favorable
to the State and excluding modifying
evidence, could reasonably show defendant
guilty of kidnapping beyond a
reasonable doubt. <EMU>Blow</EMU>, 2020 VT 106, &para; 3,
213 Vt. 651, 251 A.3d 517. Furthermore,
the trial court did not abuse its discretion
in deciding not to release defendant.

<P20><EMU>Affirmed</EMU>.
<FN>
<fnt1> Respectively, the charges alleged violations
of 13 V.S.A. &sect;&sect; 2405(a)(1)(C), 1043(a)(1), and
1042.

<fnt2> The record indicates that defendant has one
violation of probation on his record. The inconsistency
between the record and the
court's findings on this issue does not change
the outcome in this case.

<P20>The sole issue in this certified appeal
is whether an employee who sustained
a compensable injury under the Workers'
Compensation Act (act), General Statutes
&sect; 31-275 et seq., is eligible to receive total
incapacity benefits pursuant to General
Statutes &sect; 31-307(a) when the total incapacity
occurred after the employee's voluntary
retirement from the workforce. The
Appellate Court held that an employee
"who elected to retire from employment
... and affirmatively conceded that he had
no intention of returning to the workforce
... was not entitled to [total incapacity]
benefits pursuant to the [plain language of]
the statute."<fnr1> <EM>Cochran</EM> v. <EM>Dept. of Transportation,</EM>
<Page 905>
220 Conn. App. 855, 868, 299
A.3d 1247 (2023). We disagree and reverse
the judgment of the Appellate Court.

<P20>The plaintiff, Stephen T. Cochran, began
working for the defendant, the Department
of Transportation, in 1967. In 1994,
in the course of his employment for the
defendant, the plaintiff sustained an injury
to his lumbar spine while lifting a 300 to
400 pound tractor-trailer tire over a barrier
on Interstate 84. The plaintiff timely
filed an accident report and sought medical
treatment for his injury, which necessitated
two surgeries and years of pain management.
In 1995, the defendant issued a
voluntary agreement form accepting the
1994 workplace injury as compensable under
the act and acknowledging that the
plaintiff was entitled to a permanent partial
disability award of 29.5 percent to the
lumbar spine. The plaintiff continued to
work for the defendant until 2003, when he
accepted an incentivized early retirement
benefits package. He was fifty-four years
old and had no intention of returning to
the workforce at the time of his retirement.

<P20>Following his retirement, the plaintiff's
back condition deteriorated. He continued
to obtain medical treatment, including another
surgery in 2013, this one in New
York. It is undisputed that the plaintiff did
not seek authorization or notify the defendant
prior to seeking treatment or undergoing
the out-of-state surgery. In 2015, the
plaintiff requested a workers' compensation
hearing to modify his award, seeking,
among other things, total incapacity benefits
pursuant to &sect; 31-307(a) retroactive to
his retirement in 2003. The workers' compensation
commissioner for the third district
(commissioner) held a series of five
formal hearings in 2019 and 2020, at which
both the plaintiff and his wife testified.
The parties also introduced several exhibits
into evidence, including evaluations, reports,
and deposition testimony from medical
providers.

<P20>Following these formal hearings, the
commissioner found that, as of December
30, 2017, the plaintiff was totally incapacitated
and unable to work as a result of his
1994 workplace injury and, therefore, that
he was entitled to total incapacity benefits
pursuant to &sect; 31-307(a) retroactive to that
date. The commissioner also found that the
plaintiff was entitled to total incapacity
benefits for the three month period following
his 2013 surgery because the medical
testimony demonstrated that he was totally
disabled during the surgical recovery
period and that the surgery was related to
his 1994 workplace injury. Although the
commissioner awarded the plaintiff total
incapacity benefits beginning on December
30, 2017, and included the three month
period after his 2013 surgery in the award,
the commissioner declined to award total
incapacity benefits beginning on April 1,
2003, as the plaintiff had requested, finding
that the plaintiff had not met his burden
of demonstrating total incapacity going
back to 2003.

<P20>The defendant appealed to the Compensation
Review Board (board), claiming,
among other things, that the "commissioner
[had] misapplied the law when she ordered
the payment of total [incapacity]
benefits following unauthorized medical
treatment from an out-of-network, out-of-state
provider" and "when she ordered the
payment of total [incapacity] benefits ad
infinitum, despite the [plaintiff's] having
taken a voluntary incentive retirement
program in 2003 and not having suffered
any loss of earning capacity." The board
affirmed the commissioner's decision. The
board concluded that "it was well within
the [commissioner's] discretion to award"
total incapacity benefits for the three
months following the plaintiff's unauthorized
surgery in 2013 because it could be
<Page 906>
reasonably inferred from the commissioner's
decision that she had found the surgery
to be "reasonable or necessary medical
treatment." The board also concluded
that the award of total incapacity benefits
was legally proper because (1) the plain
and unambiguous language of &sect; 31-307(a)
imposes no limitations on the ability of a
retired claimant to collect total incapacity
benefits, and (2) the record provided an
adequate evidentiary basis for the commissioner's
award of such benefits commencing
on December 30, 2017.<fnr2>

<P20>The defendant next appealed to the Appellate
Court, raising two claims. First, the
defendant argued that the board erred in
affirming the commissioner's decision
awarding total incapacity benefits under
&sect; 31-307(a) beginning on December 30,
2017, because the statute does not permit
total incapacity benefits for "voluntary retirees,
like [the plaintiff], who have no
wages to replace and whose departure
from the workforce initially resulted from
their own choice, not their disability." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Cochran</EM>
v. <EM>Dept. of Transportation,</EM> supra, 220
Conn. App. at 865, 299 A.3d 1247. Second,
the defendant alternatively claimed that
the board erred in affirming the commissioner's
award of total incapacity benefits
for the three month period following his
2013 surgery "because [such] [b]enefits are
unavailable after unauthorized out-of-state
treatment absent a ... [commissioner's]
determination that the treatment was reasonable,
necessary, and unavailable in Connecticut
...." (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) Id., at 857 n.2, 299 A.3d 1247.
The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant's
first claim and concluded that,
under "the plain and unambiguous language
of &sect; 31-307(a)," when an employee
"elect[s] to take an incentivized early retirement
benefits package and never intend[s]
to reenter the workforce ... it
cannot be said that his injury <EM>resulted</EM> in
his total incapacity to work." (Emphasis in
original.) Id., at 869, 299 A.3d 1247. On this
basis, the Appellate Court reversed the
decision of the board without reaching the
defendant's second claim. See id., at 873-74,
299 A.3d 1247; see also id., at 857 n.2,
863-64 n.8 and 873 n.10, 299 A.3d 1247.

<P20>We granted the plaintiff's petition for
certification to appeal, limited to the issue
of whether the Appellate Court correctly
determined that the plaintiff was not eligible
for total incapacity benefits pursuant to
&sect; 31-307(a). <EM>Cochran</EM> v. <EM>Dept. of Transportation,</EM>
348 Conn. 919, 303 A.3d 1193
(2023).

<P20>Whether a voluntary retiree is eligible
to receive total incapacity benefits
under &sect; 31-307(a) presents "an issue of
statutory construction that has not [previously]
been subjected to judicial scrutiny,"
and we therefore will apply plenary review
to the administrative decision determining
that the award of such benefits is authorized
by statute. (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) <EM>Bergeson</EM> v. <EM>New London,</EM> 269
Conn. 763, 769, 850 A.2d 184 (2004). Our
analysis is guided by General Statutes &sect; 1-2z,
which instructs us to ascertain the
meaning of a statute in the first instance
from its text and relationship to other
statutes. If we conclude that the meaning
of the statute's text and its relationship to
other statutes "is plain and unambiguous
and does not yield absurd or unworkable
results," we may not consider extratextual
evidence of meaning. General Statutes &sect; 1-2z.

<P20>Section 31-307(a) provides in relevant
part: "If any injury for which compensation
is provided under the provisions of
this chapter <EM>results in total incapacity to
work,</EM> the injured employee shall be paid a
weekly compensation equal to seventy-five
<Page 907>
per cent of the injured employee's average
weekly earnings as of the date of the
injury, calculated pursuant to section 31-310
.... [T]he compensation shall not continue
longer than the period of total incapacity."
(Emphasis added.) Both parties
interpret the meaning of the term "shall"
to require the mandatory provision of total
incapacity benefits to eligible workers. The
crux of their disagreement lies in their
conflicting interpretations of the terms
"results in" and "total incapacity to work
...."

<P20>We construe statutory terms in accordance
with General Statutes &sect; 1-1(a),
which provides in relevant part that
"words and phrases shall be construed according
to the commonly approved usage
of the language," whereas "technical words
and phrases, and such as have acquired a
peculiar and appropriate meaning in the
law, shall be construed and understood
accordingly." We also must be mindful
that, "[i]n interpreting [statutory] language
... we do not write on a clean slate,
but are bound by our previous judicial
interpretations of this language and the
purpose of the statute." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Commissioner of Public
Safety</EM> v. <EM>Freedom of Information Commission,</EM>
312 Conn. 513, 527, 93 A.3d 1142
(2014).

<P20>Our inquiry begins with the phrase
"results in." As used in the statute, this
phrase operates to require a causal nexus
between a claimant's original compensable
injury ("any injury for which compensation
is provided under the [act]") and the claimant's
subsequent total incapacity to work.
General Statutes &sect; 31-307(a). The plaintiff's
construction relies on the assumption
that the causation requirement encompasses
incapacity to work caused by the original
compensable workplace injury, regardless
of whether the employee voluntarily
removed himself from the workforce prior
to total incapacitation. In the defendant's
view, however, "[a]n employee's injury
cannot [result] in total incapacity to work
if he voluntarily and permanently retires
and willingly chooses not to follow his customary
calling or any other occupation."
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) The
defendant characterizes voluntary, permanent
retirement as an independent cause
of total incapacity, suggesting that a claimant's
voluntary departure from the workforce
disrupts the required causal nexus
between the original workplace injury and
the subsequent total incapacity to work.

<P20>The term "result in" is a commonly
used phrasal verb. Because it is not
defined in &sect; 31-307(a) or the broader
statutory scheme, we look to the dictionary
to under-stand its ordinary meaning. See,
e.g., <EM>Seramonte Associates, LLC</EM> v. <EM>Hamden,</EM>
345 Conn. 76, 84-85, 282 A.3d 1253
(2022). Unsurprisingly, the term means the
same thing in our time as it did when it
first appeared in the statute<fnr3> in 1913: "[t]o
be a physical, logical, or legal consequence,"
or "to proceed as an outcome or
conclusion...." Black's Law Dictionary
(12th Ed. 2024) p. 1576; cf. 8 The Century
Dictionary and Cyclopedia (Rev. & Enlarged
Ed. 1911) p. 5117 (defining "result"
as "[t]o proceed, spring, or rise as a consequence
from facts, arguments, premises,
combination of circumstances, etc.; be the
outcome; be the final term in a connected
series of events, operations, etc."). These
definitions require a causal nexus between
the two events or circumstances; a workplace
injury "results in" the total incapacity
to work if that injury is a cause of the
claimant's incapacity to work. Cf. <EM>Abrahams</EM>
v. <EM>Young & Rubicam, Inc.,</EM> 240
Conn. 300, 306, 692 A.2d 709 (1997) (holding
that private cause of action provided in
Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act,
<Page 908>
General Statutes &sect; 42-110g(a), to "[a]ny
person who suffers any ascertainable loss
... as a result of the use or employment
of a [prohibited] method, act or practice"
means that prohibited conduct must be
proximate cause of such loss (internal quotation
marks omitted)). It follows that total
incapacity benefits must be paid under
&sect; 31-307(a) if the original workplace injury
is a proximate cause of the claimant's total
incapacity to work.

<P20>Our decision in <EM>Laliberte</EM> v. <EM>United Security,
Inc.,</EM> 261 Conn. 181, 801 A.2d 783
(2002), is instructive in the present case
because it addressed the causation requirement
under &sect; 31-307(a). In <EM>Laliberte,</EM>
we considered whether a claimant's incarceration
disrupted the requisite causal
nexus between his original workplace injury
and his subsequent total incapacity,
such that he had become ineligible for
benefits under &sect; 31-307(a) because his
continuing inability to work was "caused
by his incarceration" rather than by his
workplace injury. Id., at 184, 801 A.2d 783.
Looking to the language of &sect; 31-307(a), we
found no exclusion for benefits for incarcerated
recipients. Id., at 186, 801 A.2d
783. The sole eligibility criterion in the
statute was that the compensable injury
resulted in total incapacity to work. Id. We
reasoned that "[t]he fact that a claimant is
unemployable for reasons other than his
injury is not dispositive. The issue is
whether a claimant has suffered some loss
of earning capacity as a direct result of his
work-related injury." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) Id. at 188-89, 801 A.2d
783. Noting that the claimant "ha[d] been
found to be, and remain[ed], totally incapable
of working due to his disability," we
concluded that he remained entitled to total
incapacity benefits under &sect; 31-307(a).
Id., at 186, 801 A.2d 783. It was "his
disability, and not his imprisonment, that
preclude[d] him from working." Id., at 184,
801 A.2d 783.

<P20>In arriving at our conclusion in <EM>Laliberte,</EM>
we highlighted that the act was "an
intricate and comprehensive statutory
scheme" and that "it is not the court's role
to acknowledge an exclusion when the legislature
painstakingly has created such a
complete statute." Id., at 187, 801 A.2d
783. Whether total incapacity benefits
should be discontinued for incarcerated
claimants is a matter of policy "for the
legislature to decide, not the courts." Id.,
at 188, 801 A.2d 783. "If the legislature
had intended to discontinue total disability
benefits for those who are incarcerated, it
easily could have done so." Id., at 187, 801
A.2d 783. There is no such exclusion in the
statutory scheme, and we would not create
one by judicial fiat.

<P20>The defendant maintains that
<EM>Laliberte</EM> is distinguishable because the
claimant's compensable injury in that case
was "the initial cause of his separation
from the workforce" and because "he continue[d]
to want to work" while incarcerated.
This argument fails because it finds no
support in the ratio decidendi of <EM>Laliberte.</EM>
We said nothing there about the claimant's
desire or willingness to work. Nor did our
holding hinge on whether the claimant's
injury was the initial reason for his separation
from the workforce. We made no
mention of when the claimant left the
workforce or for what reason. See id., at
184, 801 A.2d 783. Our holding instead was
based on the absence of any indication in
the statutory text or legislative history
that "the legislature intended to permit
the discontinuance of total [incapacity]
benefits for totally disabled recipients who
are also unable to work as a result of incarceration."
Id., at 186, 801 A.2d 783. This
reasoning applies with equal force to the
initiation of benefits following a claimant's
voluntary retirement. The statute does not
require a causal nexus between the injury
and the claimant's actual employment status;
<Page 909>
it requires only that the injury cause
an incapacity to work. In the same way
that the claimant in <EM>Laliberte,</EM> regardless
of his incarceration status, had sustained a
work-related injury that resulted in his
incapacity to work, so, too, did the claimant
in the present case, regardless of his
retirement status, sustain an injury that
resulted in his incapacity to work. The
statute as written entitles all medically
qualified claimants to receive total incapacity
benefits, with no exception for those
claimants who may also be voluntarily retired.

<P20>This understanding also disposes of
the argument, contained in the decision of
the Appellate Court, that <EM>Laliberte</EM> is distinguishable
because it involved the discontinuance
rather than the initiation of total
incapacity benefits. See <EM>Cochran</EM> v. <EM>Dept.
of Transportation,</EM> supra, 220 Conn. App.
at 872-73, 299 A.3d 1247 (this court's "repeated
use of the phrase `discontinuance of
benefits' in <EM>Laliberte</EM> summarizes the distinction
between the claimant in that case
and the plaintiff in the present case"). We
used the term "discontinuance of benefits"
in <EM>Laliberte</EM> because it accurately described
the procedural posture of the
claimant's workers' compensation case. See
<EM>Laliberte</EM> v. <EM>United Security, Inc.,</EM> supra,
261 Conn. at 186, 801 A.2d 783. Nothing in
that opinion suggests that the result would
have been different had the claimant been
incarcerated immediately after sustaining
his compensable workplace injury and
sought total incapacity benefits for the
first time while incarcerated. As the amici
curiae the Connecticut Education Association
and the Connecticut Alliance for Retired
Americans point out, the standard of
proof for establishing initial entitlement to
total incapacity benefits is the same as the
standard for maintaining the entitlement
when discontinuance is sought. See <EM>Dengler</EM>
v. <EM>Special Attention Health Services,
Inc.,</EM> 62 Conn. App. 440, 454, 774 A.2d 992
(2001) ("total incapacity becomes a matter
of continuing proof for the period claimed"
(internal quotation marks omitted)); <EM>Cummings</EM>
v. <EM>Twin Tool Mfg. Co.,</EM> 40 Conn.
App. 36, 42, 668 A.2d 1346 (1996) (same).
Likewise, our analysis of what a claimant
must show to demonstrate initial eligibility
for benefits is identical to what a claimant
must show to demonstrate continuing eligibility
for benefits. In both cases, the causal
nexus is not disrupted by intervening circumstances,
so long as the total incapacity
results from the original compensable injury.

<P20>The legislature's use of the phrase
"total incapacity to work," the other critical
statutory language used to describe the
condition triggering entitlement to benefits
under &sect; 31-307(a), reinforces our conclusion
that the plaintiff's voluntary retirement
did not impair his right to receive
those benefits. Although its definition does
not appear in the statutory scheme, this
court previously has defined the phrase
"total incapacity to work" in considering
&sect; 31-307(a) benefits. The plaintiff cites to
<EM>Osterlund</EM> v. <EM>State,</EM> 135 Conn. 498, 66 A.2d
363 (1949), in which we defined total incapacity
to work as "not the employee's inability
to work at his customary calling, but
<EM>the destruction of his capacity to earn</EM> in
that or any other occupation [that] he can
reasonably pursue." (Emphasis added.) Id.,
at 505, 66 A.2d 363; accord <EM>Clark</EM> v. <EM>Henry
& Wright Mfg. Co.,</EM> 136 Conn. 514, 516, 72
A.2d 489 (1950); see <EM>Ferrara</EM> v. <EM>Clifton
Wright Hat Co.,</EM> 125 Conn. 140, 142-43, 3
A.2d 842 (1939) (defining total incapacity
to work as "[the] destruction or impairment
of earning capacity"); see also <EM>Esposito</EM>
v. <EM>Stamford,</EM> 350 Conn. 209, 217, 323
A.3d 1066 (2024) ("[s]pecial benefits, such
as temporary, total incapacity benefits,
continue only as long as there is an impairment
of wage earning power" (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Our cases have
similarly defined total incapacity to work
<Page 910>
as "the inability of the employee, because
of his injuries, to work at his customary
calling or at any other occupation [that] he
might reasonably follow." <EM>Czeplicki</EM> v. <EM>Fafnir
Bearing Co.,</EM> 137 Conn. 454, 456, 78
A.2d 339 (1951); accord <EM>Hart</EM> v. <EM>Federal
Express Corp.,</EM> 321 Conn. 1, 26, 135 A.3d
38 (2016); <EM>Rayhall</EM> v. <EM>Akim Co.,</EM> 263 Conn.
328, 350, 819 A.2d 803 (2003).

<P20>The defendant asserts that "the
statutory `incapacity' to work hinges on
willingness to work" and asks us to construe
&sect; 31-307(a) to require that a claimant
must be unable, yet ready and willing,
to work to establish eligibility for total
incapacity benefits. In our view, the statutory
text cannot fairly be read to contain
such a requirement. The language of the
statute focuses specifically and exclusively
on the effect of the injury on the claimant's
<EM>capacity</EM> to work. The term incapacity in
this context means the claimant's <EM>inability</EM>
to work,<fnr4> not his willingness to work. See,
e.g., <EM>Czeplicki</EM> v. <EM>Fafnir Bearing Co.,</EM> supra,
137 Conn. at 456, 78 A.2d 339. If the
legislature had intended instead to require
the injury to result in the claimant's actual
departure from the workforce, it could and
would easily have so stated by providing
that the benefits are available if the injury
results in the claimant's loss of employment
or involuntary separation from the
workforce, or words to that effect. See,
e.g., <EM>Costanzo</EM> v. <EM>Plainfield,</EM> 344 Conn. 86,
108, 277 A.3d 772 (2022) ("[i]t is a well
settled principle of statutory construction
that the legislature knows how to convey
its intent expressly ... or to use broader
or limiting terms when it chooses to do so"
(internal quotation marks omitted)).

<P20>We need not speculate about whether
the legislature, without saying so, nonetheless
intended to require willingness to
work as a precondition for total incapacity
benefits under &sect; 31-307(a), because the
statutory scheme demonstrates that the
legislature knows exactly how to impose
such a requirement when it desires to do
so: a proviso requiring willingness to work
was included as a condition to receive partial
incapacity benefits under General Statutes
&sect; 31-308(a).<fnr5> By including this requirement
in &sect; 31-308(a) but not in &sect; 31-307(a),
the legislature left no doubt that
the arrangement is deliberate. We are not
at liberty to reach a contrary conclusion.
See, e.g., <EM>PPC Realty, LLC</EM> v. <EM>Hartford,</EM>
350 Conn. 347, 358, 324 A.3d 780 (2024)
(holding that statutory provision expressly
permitting affirmative defense in one specific
context demonstrated that the legislature
did not intend to permit defense when
it was not included in context controlled by
<Page 911>
different but closely related statute in
same statutory scheme). "To agree with
the [argument that the missing term
should be supplied by construction], we
would have to graft language onto [the
statute] that does not exist, which we decline
to do." Id.

<P20>Equally unavailing is the defendant's
argument that our precedent has
already incorporated a willingness to work
requirement into &sect; 31-307(a). The cases it
relies on&mdash;<EM>Clark</EM> v. <EM>Henry & Wright Mfg.
Co.,</EM> supra, 136 Conn. at 516-17, 72 A.2d
489, <EM>Osterlund</EM> v. <EM>State,</EM> supra, 135 Conn.
at 505-506, 66 A.2d 363, <EM>Ferrara</EM> v. <EM>Clifton
Wright Hat Co.,</EM> supra, 125 Conn. at 142-43,
3 A.2d 842, and <EM>Reilley</EM> v. <EM>Carroll,</EM> 110
Conn. 282, 285-86, 147 A. 818 (1929)&mdash;do
not impose any such requirement.<fnr6> The
defendant misconstrues those cases by
overlooking the distinction between <EM>statutory</EM>
requirements and the different <EM>evidentiary</EM>
options available to a claimant to
meet those requirements. Each of the
cases relied on by the defendant addressed
factual scenarios in which the
claimants were medically able to work but
were nonetheless rendered unemployable
by their injuries.<fnr7> See, e.g., <EM>Osterlund</EM> v.
<EM>State,</EM> supra, at 506-507, 66 A.2d 363 ("[i]f,
<EM>though</EM> [<EM>the claimant</EM>] <EM>can do such work,</EM>
his physical condition due to his injury is
such that he cannot in the exercise of
reasonable diligence find an employer who
will employ him, he is just as much totally
incapacitated as though he could not work
at all" (emphasis added)). The claimants in
those cases provided evidence of unemployability
in the form of fruitless job
searches. This court then determined
whether the commissioner's findings of total
incapacity were permissible based on
the factual record. However, evidence of
willingness to work has never been required
to establish eligibility for total incapacity
benefits. See, e.g. <EM>Ferrara</EM> v. <EM>Clifton
Wright Hat Co.,</EM> supra, at 143, 3 A.2d 842
("[although an] inability to obtain work by
the exercise of due diligence is evidential
it is not so conclusive as to require a
finding of incapacity"). Rather, "[t]he evidence
must be such as to show that inability
to obtain work and earn wages, or diminished
earning capacity, exists not by
reason of any change in market conditions,
but because of a defect [that] is personal
to [the worker] and [that] is the direct
result of the injury that [the worker] has
sustained." (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) Id. In other words, as we have
established in the foregoing analysis, the
evidence must show that the claimant is
unable to work as a result of their work-related
injury. When a claimant is not
medically incapacitated but is nonetheless
rendered unemployable by their injury,
various forms of evidence will often suffice,
such as "nonphysician vocational rehabilitation
expert or medical testimony
that [the claimant] is unemployable...."
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Mikucka</EM>
v. <EM>St. Lucian's Residence, Inc.,</EM> 183
<Page 912>
Conn. App. 147, 160, 191 A.3d 1083 (2018).
In short, the defendant mistakenly construes
one way to provide evidence of total
incapacity as a generalized statutory requirement
for establishing total incapacity.
We reaffirm that there is no requirement
under &sect; 31-307(a) that a claimant demonstrate
a willingness to work, or an attempt
to find a job, in order to obtain total
incapacity benefits. In many cases, including
the present case, such a requirement
would be nonsensical: even if the plaintiff
were willing to work, the record in this
case establishes that he is unemployable.<fnr8>

<P20>Our analysis is not complete without
addressing the relationship between
&sect; 31-307(a) and related statutes. First and
foremost, as we observed previously in this
opinion, the criteria for total incapacity
benefits under &sect; 31-307(a) stand in stark
contrast to the conditions required to obtain
benefits under &sect; 31-308(a). The former
statute contains no qualifications or
conditions to eligibility for total incapacity
benefits, outside of the sole criterion that
the claimant's total incapacity be a "result"
of their compensable injury. Section 31-308(a),
by contrast, requires that a partially
incapacitated claimant either be earning a
wage, or be "ready and willing to perform
other work in the same locality" to establish
eligibility for benefits. The defendant
argues that this discrepancy is "an irrelevant
distinction in the statutory language"
but fails to provide any reason that would
explain the difference between the statutes
other than the most obvious one, which is
that a claimant seeking total incapacity
benefits need not show that he is ready
and willing to work. "We presume that the
legislature had a purpose for each sentence,
clause or phrase in a legislative
enactment, and that it did not intend to
enact meaningless provisions." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Hall</EM> v. <EM>Gilbert
& Bennett Mfg. Co.,</EM> 241 Conn. 282, 303,
695 A.2d 1051 (1997).

<P20>General Statutes &sect; 31-310, the
act's wage calculation provision, provides
further support for our construction of
&sect; 31-307(a). The wage calculation formula
for injured workers includes a provision
that applies "[w]hen the period of employment
immediately preceding the injury is
computed to be less than a net period of
two calendar weeks...."<fnr9> General Statutes
&sect; 31-310(a). This formula applies to
workers whose incapacity occurs after retirement.
See <EM>Green</EM> v. <EM>General Dynamics
Corp.,</EM> 245 Conn. 66, 75, 712 A.2d 938
(1998) ("[w]hen an employee is retired and
<Page 913>
unemployed at [the time of injury], the
`employment previous to injury' is necessarily
less than two weeks and the contemporaneous
prevailing weekly wage is considered
the employee's weekly wage").<fnr10> It
would make no sense for the legislature to
enact a wage calculation formula for benefits
that do not exist. The enactment of a
wage calculation formula that contemplates
benefits being paid to workers
whose incapacity occurs after retirement
indirectly supports our conclusion that total
incapacity benefits are available to that
category of claimants under &sect; 31-307(a).

<P20>The causation requirement in
General Statutes &sect; 7-433c, governing eligibility
for heart and hypertension benefits,
is also instructive. Section 7-433c provides
in relevant part that, if a uniformed and
paid municipal police officer or firefighter
"suffers ... any condition or impairment
of health caused by hypertension or heart
disease <EM>resulting in</EM> his death or his temporary
or permanent, total or partial disability,"
he is entitled to workers' compensation
benefits. (Emphasis added.) Heart
and hypertension benefits under &sect; 7-433c
are administered under the act. See <EM>Bergeson</EM>
v. <EM>New London,</EM> supra, 269 Conn. at
778, 850 A.2d 184 (recognizing that "the
type and amount of benefits available pursuant
to &sect; 7-433c are the same as those
under the [act]," which is "a procedural
avenue for administration of the benefits
under &sect; 7-433c" (emphasis omitted; internal
quotation marks omitted)). In a recent
case, <EM>Coughlin</EM> v. <EM>Stamford Fire Dept.,</EM> 334
Conn. 857, 224 A.3d 1161 (2020), we held
that a firefighter who was not diagnosed
with coronary artery disease until after he
had retired from employment was nonetheless
eligible for heart and hypertension
benefits. See id., at 866-67, 869, 224 A.3d
1161. We reasoned that "a claimant may
pursue claims for subsequent, related
[heart and hypertension] injuries, regardless
of whether he or she is still employed
.... To conclude ... that heart disease
claims occurring after retirement are not
compensable, even if such claims flow from
a primary compensable claim&mdash;would run
afoul of the clear legislative intent underlying
&sect; 7-433c."<fnr11> (Citations omitted.) Id., at
866-67, 224 A.3d 1161. Although the legislative
intent of &sect; 7-433c is beyond the
scope of our threshold &sect; 1-2z analysis, we
find it persuasive that such a closely related
statute mirroring the language in &sect; 31-307(a)
permits the receipt of benefits by
workers whose incapacity occurs after voluntary
retirement.

<P20>Notwithstanding this textual evidence,
the Appellate Court held, and the defendant
maintains, that awarding total incapacity
benefits to workers when their total
incapacity occurs after their voluntary retirement
<Page 914>
would frustrate the purpose of
the statute as expressed in our prior case
law. See <EM>Cochran</EM> v. <EM>Dept. of Transportation,</EM>
supra, 220 Conn. App. at 870, 299
A.3d 1247. The Appellate Court construes
our precedent to mean that the purpose of
&sect; 31-307(a) is to compensate for a worker's
"wage loss" and that awarding such
benefits to a claimant who has voluntarily
retired with no intention of returning to
the workforce "would not effectuate the
statutory purpose" because such a claimant
would not have any lost wages to
replace. (Internal quotation marks omitted.)
Id. The defendant cites to two cases
in support of this reading of our precedent:
<EM>Rayhall</EM> v. <EM>Akim Co.,</EM> supra, 263 Conn. 328,
819 A.2d 803, and <EM>Pizzuto</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Mental Retardation,</EM> 283 Conn. 257,
927 A.2d 811 (2007). See <EM>Cochran</EM> v. <EM>Dept.
of Transportation,</EM> supra, at 870, 299 A.3d
1247 (relying on and quoting <EM>Pizzuto</EM>).

<P20>The flaw in this argument is that
it does not take into account that our
precedent recognizes two purposes served
by total incapacity benefits. As the Appellate
Court points out, the benefits function
to replace lost wages that the claimant is
unable to earn as the result of the incapacitating
effects of the work-related injury.
See id. However, our precedent has also
characterized the purpose of total incapacity
benefits as compensation for the loss of
earning power or capacity. See <EM>Esposito</EM> v.
<EM>Stamford,</EM> supra, 350 Conn. at 218, 323
A.3d 1066 (categorizing total and partial
incapacity benefits as compensation for
"the loss of earning capacity"); <EM>Churchville</EM>
v. <EM>Bruce R. Daly Mechanical Contractor,</EM>
299 Conn. 185, 192, 8 A.3d 507 (2010)

takes the form of partial or total incapacity
benefits" (internal quotation marks omitted));

294 Conn. 564, 577, 986 A.2d 1023
(2010) (total and partial incapacity benefits
are "designed to compensate for loss of
earning capacity"); <EM>Mulligan</EM> v. <EM>F. S. Electric,</EM>
231 Conn. 529, 541, 651 A.2d 254
(1994) ("[c]ompensation under [the] [a]ct is
based [on] incapacity, total or partial, and
hence is based [on] loss of earning power"

v. <EM>Collins Co.,</EM> 114 Conn. 24, 31, 157 A. 264
(1931) ("[c]ompensation under [the] [a]ct is

hence is based [on] loss of earning power"

v. <EM>Carroll,</EM> supra, 110 Conn. at 285, 147
A. 818 ("[t]he object of our statute was to
give compensation for a total or partial
loss of the capacity to earn wages" (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Indeed,
<EM>Rayhall</EM> itself uses this formulation in a
different part of the opinion. See <EM>Rayhall</EM>
v. <EM>Akim Co.,</EM> supra, 263 Conn. at 349, 819
A.2d 803 ("[c]ompensation for <EM>loss of earning
power</EM> takes the form of partial or total
incapacity benefits" (emphasis added)).
Awarding total incapacity benefits to a
claimant who becomes incapacitated after
retirement, and who therefore cannot earn
a living should they need or desire to
return to the workforce, serves the purpose
of compensating for loss of earning
power.

<P20>Our precedent does not prioritize
one of these purposes over the other but,
rather, demonstrates that total incapacity
benefits under &sect; 31-307(a) serve a dual
purpose: to compensate for both wage loss
and loss of earning power. See, e.g., <EM>Czeplicki</EM>
v. <EM>Fafnir Bearing Co.,</EM> supra, 137
Conn. at 456, 78 A.2d 339 ("[<EM>o</EM>]<EM>ne</EM> purpose
of the statute is to give compensation for
loss of earning power" (emphasis added)).
In most cases, these losses are coextensive.
But, when the dual purposes do not
align, we defer to the purpose that accomplishes
the broader "humanitarian and remedial
purposes of the act ...." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Gould</EM> v. <EM>Stamford,</EM>
331 Conn. 289, 304, 203 A.3d 525
(2019). When a claimant's total incapacity
occurs after their voluntary retirement, total
<Page 915>
incapacity benefits under &sect; 31-307(a)
accomplish the purpose of compensating
the claimant for their loss of earning power.

<P20>In light of the foregoing, we
conclude that, under the plain and unambiguous
language of &sect; 31-307(a), a worker
who has sustained a compensable workplace
injury under the act is eligible to
receive total incapacity benefits when the
total incapacity occurs after their voluntary
retirement from the workforce. The
text of the statute does not contain any
exclusions for a worker whose incapacity
occurs after retirement, and no such limitation
is fairly implied by its context or
other relevant components of the act. As
we noted previously in this opinion, the
text of &sect; 31-307(a) could have been drafted
to entitle a claimant to benefits for a
work-related injury resulting in an actual
wage loss, or to require the claimant seeking
such benefits to be ready and willing to
work but for the injury (as &sect; 31-308(a)
requires). But it was not. Instead, the statute,
in plain and unambiguous terms, provides
that the claimant is entitled to benefits
for a work-related injury resulting in
their <EM>incapacity</EM> to work. In this regard,
the statute is not "susceptible to more than
one reasonable interpretation." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Gonzalez</EM> v. <EM>O &
G Industries, Inc.,</EM> 322 Conn. 291, 303, 140
A.3d 950 (2016). The defendant makes no
argument that our construction of the statute,
permitting eligibility for total incapacity
benefits when the incapacity occurs after
retirement, is absurd or unworkable.
Thus, pursuant to &sect; 1-2z, having assessed
the plain meaning of the text and its relationship
to other statutes, we come to the
end of our analysis.<fnr12> "It is not the role of
this court to engraft additional requirements
onto clear statutory language." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Reserve
Realty, LLC</EM> v. <EM>Windemere Reserve, LLC,</EM>
346 Conn. 391, 410, 291 A.3d 64 (2023); see,
e.g., <EM>Hasychak v. Zoning Board of Appeals,</EM>
296 Conn. 434, 441-42 n.8, 994 A.2d
1270 (2010).

<P20>We acknowledge the concerns expressed
by the defendant that employers
and their insurers may incur increased and
more unpredictable costs if they are required
to pay total incapacity benefits to
claimants whose eligibility arises after retirement,
and that benefits for lost earning
capacity paid to retirees may be considered
a windfall from one perspective. To
the extent that these concerns are compelling,
however, they emanate from the statute
as written, and their amelioration lies
in the hands of the legislature. "The complex
nature of the [act] requires that policy
determinations should be left to the legislature,
not the judiciary." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>McCullough</EM> v. <EM>Swan
Engraving, Inc.,</EM> 320 Conn. 299, 310, 130
A.3d 231 (2016). In this regard, we observe
that the legislature, by existing legislation,
appears to have considered and regulated
the interplay between and among various
<Page 916>
sources of government benefits available to
retirees, including workers' compensation
benefits, and has affirmatively limited the
benefits available to the plaintiff and similarly
situated, retired workers.<fnr13>

<P20>In summary, we agree with
the board that &sect; 31-307(a) "imposes no
constraints on a claimant's ability to collect
temporary total disability benefits due to
age or retirement status" and hold that a
claimant who sustains a compensable injury
under the act is eligible to receive total
incapacity benefits regardless of whether
their total incapacity occurs before or after
their voluntary retirement.

<P20>The only remaining issue is the
defendant's alternative claim that the
board erred in affirming the commissioner's
award of &sect; 31-307(a) benefits for the
three month period following the plaintiff's
2013 surgery in the absence of a determination
that the treatment was reasonable,
necessary, and available in Connecticut.
The Appellate Court did not reach the
defendant's alternative claim, and the parties
have not briefed or argued the issue
before this court in the present certified
appeal. See <EM>Cochran</EM> v. <EM>Dept. of Transportation,</EM>
supra, 220 Conn. App. at 857 n.2,
299 A.3d 1247. We therefore reverse the
judgment of the Appellate Court and remand
the case to that court for consideration
of that issue.

<P20>The judgment of the Appellate Court is
reversed and the case is remanded to that
court with direction to consider the defendant's
remaining claim on appeal.

<P20>In this opinion the other justices
concurred.
<FN>
<fnt*> The listing of justices reflects their seniority
status on this court as of the date of oral
argument.

<fnt1> Total incapacity benefits are commonly referred
to as temporary total disability benefits,
which is the term the Appellate Court used.
See <EM>Cochran</EM> v. <EM>Dept. of Transportation,</EM> 220
Conn. App. 855, 868, 299 A.3d 1247 (2023);
see also id., at 870-71, 299 A.3d 1247. For
ease of reference and consistency with the
statutory terminology, we refer to these benefits
as total incapacity benefits.

<fnt2> The defendant also raised additional claims
of error not at issue in the present appeal.

<fnt3> Public Acts 1913, c. 138, pt. B, &sect; 11.

<fnt4> The dictionary definition of incapacity is
"the quality or state of being incapable: inability,
incapability...." Webster's Third New
International Dictionary (2002) p. 1141. This
mirrors the dictionary definition of incapacity
when the statute was first enacted in 1913:
"[l]ack of capacity; lack of ability or qualification;
inability; incapability; incompetency." 5
The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia (Rev.
& Enlarged Ed. 1911) p. 3031. There is nothing
in the dictionary definition suggesting that
the word includes a volitional aspect, i.e., the
incapacitated person's willingness to perform
the undertaking.

<fnt5> General Statutes &sect; 31-308(a) provides in
relevant part: "If any injury for which compensation
is provided under the provisions of
this chapter results in partial incapacity, the
injured employee shall be paid a weekly compensation
equal to seventy-five per cent of the
difference between the wages currently
earned by an employee in a position comparable
to the position held by the injured employee
before his injury ... except that when (1)
the physician, physician assistant or advanced
practice registered nurse attending an injured
employee certifies that the employee is unable
to perform his usual work but is able to
perform other work, (2) <EM>the employee is ready
and willing to perform other work in the same
locality</EM> and (3) no other work is available, the
employee shall be paid his full weekly compensation
subject to the provisions of this
section...." (Emphasis added.)

<fnt6> The defendant also cites to <EM>Hansen</EM> v. <EM>Gordon,</EM>
221 Conn. 29, 39-41, 602 A.2d 560
(1992), in support of its claim that employees
are eligible for total incapacity benefits only if
their injury "involuntarily separates them
from the workforce." <EM>Hansen</EM> is inapposite
because it did not involve &sect; 31-307(a) benefits
but, rather, the availability of partial incapacity
benefits under &sect; 31-308(a).

<fnt7> There are various reasons that an injured
claimant who is medically able to work may
nonetheless be rendered unemployable due to
their injuries. In older cases, the reason was
often the stigma associated with a claimant's
disability. Our more recent jurisprudence assesses
whether "a claimant is realistically employable"
based on a holistic "analysis of the
effects of the compensable injury [on] the
claimant, in combination with [their] preexisting
talents, deficiencies, education and intelligence
levels, vocational background, age, and
any other factors [that] might prove relevant."
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Mikucka</EM>
v. <EM>St. Lucian's Residence, Inc.,</EM> 183 Conn. App.
147, 160, 191 A.3d 1083 (2018).

<fnt8> In concluding that the plaintiff was unemployable
as of December 30, 2017, the commissioner
reviewed medical evidence, vocational
reports, and testimony. She was fully
persuaded by the testimony of Phillip S: Dickey,
a neurosurgeon, who attested that the
plaintiff's 1994 workplace injury was a "substantial
contributing factor" to his disability
and that he had "the lightest of work capacities."
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) She
was also persuaded by the expert testimony of
Albert J. Sabella, a vocational rehabilitation
counselor, who attested that the plaintiff "lies
down periodically during the day to help reduce
and relieve exacerbations of severe pain.
He reports much difficulty bending and lifting
any weight from the floor level. From table
height he rates his capacity [as fifteen] maybe
[twenty] pounds; however, not repetitively
and he can't carry any weight because of his
use of [a] cane and [his] balance issues."
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) The board
agreed that "the evidentiary record in this
matter provided an adequate basis" for the
commissioner's findings, noting the statement
in Sabella's report that "the combined and
compounded effect of [the plaintiff's] employment
barriers manifest to an extent that renders
him unemployable for any practical vocational
purpose." (Internal quotation marks
omitted.)

<fnt9> For purposes of wage calculation, "the date
of injury" in &sect; 31-310 is construed to mean
the date of incapacity. <EM>Mulligan</EM> v. <EM>F. S. Electric,</EM>
231 Conn. 529, 544-45, 651 A.2d 254
(1994).

<fnt10> Similarly, General Statutes &sect; 31-310c provides
a wage calculation formula for occupational
diseases that manifest "at a time when
the worker has not worked during the twenty-six
weeks immediately preceding the diagnosis
of such disease ...." This statute likewise
applies to workers who are retired at the time
the disease manifests. See <EM>Green</EM> v. <EM>General
Dynamics Corp.,</EM> supra, 245 Conn. at 79, 712
A.2d 938 (holding that, under &sect; 31-310c,
worker's complete retirement at time of incapacity
did not bar award of weekly death
benefits to his spouse for permanent loss of
earning capacity).

<fnt11> As we recognized in <EM>Coughlin,</EM> "&sect; 7-433c
was intended to eliminate two of the basic
requirements for coverage under [the act],
namely the causal connection between hypertension
and heart disease and the employment,
and the requirement that the illness
was suffered during the course of employment
.... More specifically, the legislature's
intent was to afford the named occupations
with a bonus by way of a rebuttable presumption
of compensability when, under the appropriate
conditions, the employee suffered
heart disease or hypertension." (Citation
omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)
<EM>Coughlin</EM> v. <EM>Stamford Fire Dept.,</EM> supra, 334
Conn. at 864, 224 A.3d 1161.

<fnt12> We decline the invitation to look to the
precedent of other states, as the defendant
urges, or to the interpretations of the federal
Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation
Act, 33 U.S.C. &sect; 901 et seq. (2018), by the
United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth
and Ninth Circuits, as amicus curiae the Connecticut
Counsel for Occupational Safety and
Health urges. Even if it were proper for us to
consider these materials under &sect; 1-2z when
the meaning of the statute is plain and unambiguous,
they are of dubious value in the
present context because legislation regulating
workers' compensation systems typically involves
a complex, multivariable, interrelated
scheme of policy choices that differ from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction. See, e.g., <EM>Pokorny</EM> v.
<EM>Getta's Garage,</EM> 219 Conn. 439, 460-61 n.15,
594 A.2d 446 (1991) (noting that precedent of
other states is often of "limited assistance,
because the courts are construing the terms of
their own [workers' compensation acts]
which generally differ materially from our
[a]ct" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
The conclusion we reach in this case is based
on the plain meaning of &sect; 31-307(a).

<fnt13> Disability retirement payments under the
State Employees Retirement Act, General
Statutes &sect; 5-152 et seq., the Municipal Employees
Retirement System, General Statutes
&sect; 7-425 et seq., and the Teachers' Retirement
System, General Statutes &sect; 10-183b et seq.,
are reduced by the amount of workers' compensation
benefits, including total incapacity
benefits. See General Statutes &sect;&sect; 5-169(g)(1)
through (3) and 5-170 (b) and (c) (state employees);
General Statutes &sect; 7-436(d) (municipal
employees); General Statutes &sect; 10-183bb(b)
and (c) (public school teachers). Additionally,
in 1993, the General Assembly enacted
legislation reducing total incapacity benefits
to retirees also receiving old age benefits under
the federal Social Security Act. See Public
Acts 1993, 93-228, &sect; 16, codified at General
Statutes (Rev. to 1995) &sect; 31-307(e). Although
the legislature repealed this provision in
2006, both parties agree that it continues to
apply to workers, including the plaintiff, who
were injured prior to the date of repeal. See
Public Acts 2006, No. 06-84, &sect; 1. Finally, the
statutory scheme provides a mechanism to
discontinue benefits to individuals who are no
longer eligible under General Statutes &sect; 31-315.
As the amici curiae the Connecticut Education
Association and the Connecticut Alliance
for Retired Americans highlight, this
provision demonstrates that total incapacity
benefits are not awarded "ad infinitum." All
injured workers&mdash;including retirees&mdash;maintain
the burden of proving eligibility throughout
the life of their claim. See <EM>Reilley</EM> v. <EM>Carroll,</EM>
supra, 110 Conn. at 287, 147 A. 818 ("[i]t
is at all times within the power of the defendant-employer,
or his insurer, to terminate
the period of total incapacity and end or
reduce liability for compensation ... under
the express limitation of the award until it [is]
shown that ... [the plaintiff's] incapacity has
diminished or ceased" (internal quotation
marks omitted)).

<P20>The petitioner, Terry D. Johnson, appeals
from the judgment of the habeas
court denying his petition for a writ of
habeas corpus. On appeal, he claims that
the court improperly concluded that his
criminal trial counsel were not ineffective
in (1) advising him to plead guilty, (2)
failing to raise a diminished capacity defense,
(3) failing to raise the issue of his
competency at two different proceedings,
and (4) advising him that the court would
not accept his guilty plea after the issue of
his competency had been raised at that
same proceeding. We disagree and, accordingly,
affirm the judgment of the habeas
court.

<P20>The following facts and procedural history
are relevant to this appeal. On December
10, 1992, the petitioner pleaded guilty
to murder and felony murder in violation
of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) &sect;&sect; 53a-54a
and 53a-54c, capital felony murder of a
member of the division of state police,
while the officer was acting within the
scope of his or her duties, in violation of
General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) &sect;&sect; 53a-54b(1),
53a-54a(a) and (c) and 53a-54c, and
burglary in the first degree in violation of
General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) &sect; 53a-101(a)(1)
and (2). These charges arose from
the shooting death of Connecticut State
Trooper Russell Bagshaw during the commission
of a burglary of a sporting goods
store.

<P20>At the time of his guilty plea, the petitioner
admitted the following facts before a
three judge panel,<fnr1> <EM>Corrigan, Spada</EM> and
<EM>Potter, Js.</EM>: "During the early morning
<SPage 580>
hours of June 5, 1991, the [petitioner]
and his brother, Duane Johnson, broke
into the Land and Sea Sports Center
(Land and Sea) in North Windham. The
[petitioner] entered the building through a
small window and removed several weapons
and boxes of ammunition from the
Land and Sea by passing them through
the window to Duane. The [petitioner]
loaded a semiautomatic nine millimeter
pistol and passed that weapon through the
window to Duane as well. During the
course of the break-in, Bagshaw, who was
on routine patrol in the vicinity, drove his
cruiser into the parking lot of the Land
and Sea. Duane saw Bagshaw's cruiser
approaching and warned the [petitioner].
The [petitioner] exited the Land and Sea
through the window by which he had entered.
The [petitioner], armed with the
semiautomatic nine millimeter pistol, then
proceeded to wait near the building. As
Bagshaw's cruiser approached the Land
and Sea, the [petitioner] began shooting at
the cruiser. One of the bullets fired by the
[petitioner] hit Bagshaw, fatally wounding
him. The [petitioner] and Duane then fled
the scene." <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Johnson,</EM> 253 Conn. 1,
6, 751 A.2d 298 (2000).

<P20>Following his arrest, Attorneys Patrick
Culligan and Ramon Canning were appointed
to represent the petitioner. On
October 22, 1992, the petitioner appeared
at a hearing before Judge Corrigan regarding
his motion to change his election
of a jury trial to a three judge panel.
When canvassed by Judge Corrigan, the
petitioner initially denied consuming any
alcohol or drugs within the past twenty-four
<Page 923>
hours. The petitioner then stated
that, approximately twelve hours before
the hearing, he had taken "sleeping pills,
body tranquilizers"
<SPage 581>
but commented that
he felt "pretty good." He indicated that he
had no difficulty hearing the court, and, in
response to the court's inquiry as to
whether he understood the proceeding,
the petitioner responded: "Yes, pretty
much to&mdash;as much as it makes sense." At
the conclusion of the court's canvass,
Judge Corrigan stated that, "[i]n view of
the motion and remarks of the [petitioner]
concerning the motion, his knowledge and
<EM>apparent competency</EM> and capacity to understand
the questioning ... the court
grants the [petitioner's] motion [for a
three judge panel]." (Emphasis added.)

<P20>The three judge panel subsequently held
a hearing on December 10, 1992. At the
outset, the petitioner's counsel moved for a
competency hearing pursuant to General
Statutes (Rev. to 1991) &sect; 54-56d. The basis
for this motion was a December 9, 1992
letter sent to Culligan from David M. Mantell,
a clinical psychologist who had examined
the petitioner. In that letter, Mantell
raised a concern regarding the petitioner's
competency.<fnr2> Judge Corrigan responded
that he had found the petitioner competent
on October 22, 1992, and that Mantell's
letter did not change that determination.
Judge Corrigan further stated that the
burden of proof for this issue rested with
the petitioner. Counsel offered to have
Mantell appear in court and testify, to
which Judge Corrigan responded: "Well, if
he's going to testify
<SPage 582>
by virtue of what's
in the letter it would not be sufficient."
Judge Corrigan then denied the petitioner's
motion for a competency examination.

<P20>The petitioner then directly addressed
the three judge panel (trial court), stating:
"In order to save the family additional
suffering I hereby plead guilty and accept
responsibility for the crimes I have committed."
Specifically, the petitioner pleaded
guilty to murder and felony murder, capital
felony murder, and burglary as alleged
in counts one, two, and three of the
amended information dated December 9,
1992. The prosecutor then presented a detailed
recitation of the facts underlying the
criminal charges. After a recess, the trial
court conducted a thorough and comprehensive
canvass of the petitioner with respect
to his guilty plea.<fnr3> It found that the
petitioner's plea was "made knowingly, intelligently,
and voluntarily, with full understanding
of the crimes charged&mdash;their possible
penalties&mdash;and the consequences of
such a plea&mdash;and after adequate advice
<Page 924>
and assistance of counsel. The [trial] court
finds there exists a factual basis to support
acceptance of these pleas, and the pleas of
guilty are accepted and may be recorded
and a finding of guilt is made."

<P20>"After the [petitioner's] guilty plea, a
separate sentencing hearing was conducted
pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to
1991) &sect; 53a-46a .... At the conclusion of
the sentencing phase of the trial, the jury
found an aggravating factor and no mitigating
factor. In accordance with the jury's
findings, the trial court rendered a judgment
of guilty of capital felony and imposed
the
<SPage 583>
death penalty on the [petitioner]."<fnr4>
(Footnote omitted.) <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>Johnson,</EM> supra, 253 Conn. at 6-8, 751 A.2d
298.

<P20>The petitioner appealed to our Supreme
Court, and he raised twenty-eight issues.
Id. at 9, 751 A.2d 298. The court reversed
the judgment imposing the death penalty
on the basis of insufficient evidence of an
aggravating factor and remanded the case
with direction to impose a life sentence
without the possibility of release. Id. As a
result of this conclusion, the court considered
only four of the petitioner's remaining
claims. Id. at 9-10, 751 A.2d 298. Specifically,
the petitioner argued that the trial
court improperly had denied his motions
for a competency examination, made on
December 10, 1992, and on March 3, 4 and
9, 1993, in violation of his state and federal
constitutional rights. Id. at 11-19, 751 A.2d
298. Our Supreme Court concluded that,
although the trial court had applied an
improper evidentiary standard to the petitioner's
requests for a competency evaluation,
this error did not deprive him of his
rights to due process. Id. at 12-13, 751
A.2d 298. He also claimed that the trial
court improperly (1) accepted his guilty
pleas because they were not knowing, intelligent,
or voluntary, and there was not
substantial compliance with our rules of
practice; id. at 31-32, 751 A.2d 298; (2)
denied his motion to withdraw his guilty
plea without holding an evidentiary hearing
or appointing new counsel; id. at 47,
751 A.2d 298; and (3) deprived him of a fair
determination of probable cause. Id. at 78,
751 A.2d 298. Our Supreme Court rejected
all of the petitioner's arguments with respect
to these claims.
<SPage 584>

<P20>The petitioner subsequently commenced
the present habeas action. In an
amended petition dated June 18, 2020, the
petitioner alleged ineffective assistance of
counsel. Specifically, the petitioner claimed
that Canning and Culligan were ineffective
in failing (1) to advise him not to plead
guilty, (2) to reasonably investigate, plead,
and/or raise diminished capacity as a defense
at the guilt phase, and (3) to preserve
the issue of competency based on the
petitioner's statements at the October 22
and December 10, 1992 canvasses. Additionally,
the petitioner claimed that Canning
provided ineffective assistance of
counsel by advising him that the trial court
would stop the proceedings and not accept
his guilty plea after the issue of competency
had been raised at the December 10,
1992 proceeding.

<P20>The habeas court held a one day trial on
November 10, 2021. The petitioner submitted
<Page 925>
a number of documents that were admitted
into evidence, namely, transcripts,
psychological evaluations and reports, and
a copy of the criminal case file. The petitioner,
Canning, and Attorney Walter
Bansley III testified. The parties submitted
posttrial briefs.

<P20>On July 25, 2022, the court issued a
memorandum of decision denying the petition
for a writ of habeas corpus. At the
outset, the court explained that it addressed
the allegations of deficient performance
made against only Canning as if
they were made against both Canning and
Culligan and that, to the extent that any
claim mentioned in the amended petition
was not addressed in the posttrial briefs, it
was deemed abandoned. After setting
forth the relevant legal principles, the
court then considered the petitioner's
claim that "counsel failed to advise him
that he should not plead guilty when he
would not be spared the death penalty and
would be accepting no less than life without
the possibility of parole. Stated somewhat
differently and as briefed by the
petitioner, the petitioner faults counsel for
[failing
<SPage 585>
to advise him not to] plead
guilty because there was no practical benefit
gained from pleading guilty. Subsumed
within this claim is the prospect that the
petitioner would have accomplished a better
outcome in the guilt phase by going to
trial instead of pleading guilty." The court
concluded that it was a reasonable and
sound strategy to recommend that the petitioner
plead guilty because it could be
considered a mitigating factor pursuant to
General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) &sect; 53a-46a(d)
during the sentencing phase of the
trial. Thus, the court determined that
counsel were not deficient in their performance.
Additionally, the court concluded
that the petitioner had failed to demonstrate
prejudice "because he has not
shown that the outcome of the guilt phase
would have been any different or better.
The petitioner has not substantiated any
defenses that, had they been raised, would
have resulted in any convictions or less
punishment than what resulted of the
guilty pleas. The court also does not credit
the petitioner's testimony, which was inconsistent
and highly selective, that he
would not have pleaded guilty." Finally,
the habeas court pointed out that the reversal
of the death penalty and imposition
of life imprisonment without the possibility
of release as a result of his appeal to our
Supreme Court further supported the absence
of prejudice.

<P20>The court then considered the petitioner's
claim that counsel were ineffective in
failing to investigate, plead, and/or raise a
diminished capacity defense. It determined
that the petitioner had failed to present
any evidence to substantiate the claim that
a viable diminished capacity defense existed
that would have resulted in a conviction
for a lesser included offense or an acquittal.
Accordingly, the court concluded that
he failed to establish that his counsel's
performance was deficient or that he was
prejudiced as a result.

<P20>Next, the court addressed the petitioner's
claim that counsel were ineffective in
failing to object to the canvass conducted
by Judge Corrigan at the October 22,
<SPage 586>
1992 proceeding in which the petitioner
requested to be tried before a three judge
panel at the guilt phase. The petitioner
claimed that, on the basis of his responses
during that canvass, counsel should have
objected and raised the issue of lack of
competency. The court disagreed that the
petitioner's responses during this canvass
supported the contention that he was not
competent and concluded: "The petitioner
has not shown that counsel were deficient
for failing to object to the October 22
canvass, which only has a tangential connection
to the actual guilty pleas, nor that
he was prejudiced."
<Page 926>

<P20>The court then turned to the petitioner's
claim that his counsel were ineffective
in failing to object or raise a claim
that he was incompetent to plead guilty
after Judge Corrigan denied his motion
for a competency evaluation with respect
to the issue of his competency to stand
trial at the outset of the December 10,
1992 proceeding. In rejecting this claim,
the court stated: "Counsel represented a
client in a capital case with egregious
facts and no viable mental health defense.
None of the experts who evaluated the
petitioner were able to conclude that he
was not competent. Attorney Canning acknowledged
that the [December 10, 1992]
last-minute request for a competency
evaluation was intended to delay the proceedings.<fnr5>
Consequently, the court concludes
that the petitioner has failed to
present any evidence that counsel were
ineffective for failing to object to the December
10, 1992 canvass." (Footnote added.)

<P20>Finally, the court addressed the petitioner's
claim that his counsel were ineffective
in advising him that the court would
refuse to accept his guilty plea after the
issue of his competence had been raised at
the same proceeding. He also claimed that
he had not wanted to
<SPage 587>
plead guilty. The
court determined that "[t]he credible evidence
belies the petitioner's contentions."
It further explained that the petitioner had
failed to demonstrate deficient performance
or prejudice with respect to this
claim.

<P20>In conclusion, the court stated: "The
evidence in the habeas case, submitted
nearly thirty years after the underlying
criminal proceedings, shows that the defense
quickly retained a defense expert
who extensively and thoroughly evaluated
the petitioner in preparation for potential
defenses and mitigating evidence. The
credible evidence supports the conclusion
that the petitioner was competent, did not
have a viable defense to assert in the guilt
phase, that the state had overwhelming
evidence against the petitioner, and that
guilty verdicts on all charged counts were
all but assured. The defense strategy of
the petitioner pleading guilty and then
proceeding to the penalty phase, which
now could encompass the mitigant that the
petitioner had taken full responsibility for
his crimes and not made the victim's family
go through both phases of the trial, was
reasonable and sound. A trial in the guilt
phase would have removed an important
mitigant from the scale that the petitioner
was attempting to tilt in his favor.

<P20>"The court concludes that the petitioner
has not proven that counsel failed to object
to any of the court canvasses and were
deficient in their performance when he
pleaded guilty. Additionally, the petitioner
has failed to prove that he was prejudiced
because he has not shown that the out-come
of the guilt phase would have been
any different or better. The petitioner has
not substantiated any defenses that, had
they been raised, would have resulted in
any convictions or less punishment than
what resulted ....

<P20>"Lastly, the Supreme Court's decision to
vacate the sentence of death, which resulted
in a sentence of life
<SPage 588>
without the
possibility of release, further supports the
conclusion that the petitioner was not prejudiced
by pleading guilty. Had the state
agreed not to seek the death penalty in
exchange for the petitioner's guilty plea,
then his convictions and sentences would
be precisely what he has today. Therefore,
the court concludes that counsel were not
ineffective as to the petitioner's guilty
plea." The court denied the petition for a
writ of habeas corpus, and subsequently
granted his petition for certification to appeal.
This appeal followed.
<Page 927>

<P20>Before addressing the petitioner's
specific appellate claims, we set forth
the relevant legal principles and our standard
of review. The sixth amendment to
the United States constitution guarantees
a criminal defendant the right to the effective
assistance of counsel for his defense.
See, e.g., <EM>Coltherst</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of
Correction,</EM> 208 Conn. App. 470, 477, 264
A.3d 1080 (2021), cert. denied, 340 Conn.
920, 267 A.3d 857 (2022). "To succeed on a
claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a
habeas petitioner must satisfy the two-pronged
test articulated in <EM>Strickland</EM> v.
<EM>Washington,</EM> [466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct.
2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984)]. <EM>Strickland</EM>
requires that a petitioner satisfy both a
performance prong and a prejudice
prong .... To satisfy the performance
prong, the petitioner must establish that
his counsel made errors so serious that
[counsel] was not functioning as the counsel
guaranteed the [petitioner] by the
[s]ixth [a]mendment.... The petitioner
must thus show that counsel's representation
fell below an objective standard of
reasonableness considering all of the circumstances
.... [A] court must indulge a
strong presumption that counsel's conduct
falls within the wide range of reasonable
professional assistance; that is, the [petitioner]
must overcome the presumption
that, under the circumstances, the challenged
action might be considered sound
trial strategy
<SPage 589>
.... Furthermore, the
right to counsel is not the right to perfect
counsel ....

<P20>"To satisfy the prejudice prong, a
claimant must demonstrate that there is a
reasonable probability that, but for counsel's
unprofessional errors, the result of
the proceeding would have been different
.... A reasonable probability is a probability
sufficient to undermine confidence
in the outcome.... In its analysis, a reviewing
court may look to the performance
prong or to the prejudice prong, and the
petitioner's failure to prove either is fatal
to a habeas petition ....

<P20>"On appeal, [a]lthough the underlying
historical facts found by the habeas
court may not be disturbed unless they
[are] clearly erroneous, whether those
facts constituted a violation of the petitioner's
rights [to the effective assistance of
counsel] under the sixth amendment is a
mixed determination of law and fact that
requires the application of legal principles
to the historical facts of [the] case .... As
such, that question requires plenary review
by this court unfettered by the clearly
erroneous standard." (Citations omitted;
internal quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Soyini</EM>
v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 222 Conn.
App. 428, 441-42, 305 A.3d 662 (2023), cert.
denied, 348 Conn. 940, 307 A.3d 274 (2024).
Guided by these principles, we turn to the
specific claims raised by the petitioner in
this appeal.

<CN>I

<P20>The petitioner first claims that the court
improperly concluded that counsel were
not ineffective by advising him to plead
guilty. Specifically, he argues that counsel
were ineffective by advising him to plead
guilty without receiving any benefit or consideration
for doing so and he suffered
prejudice as a result thereof. We conclude
that the petitioner failed to establish prejudice
with respect to this claim.
<SPage 590>

<P20>The following additional facts are necessary
for the resolution of this issue. At
the habeas trial, the petitioner testified
that he pleaded guilty on the advice of
Canning and Culligan. He further stated
that he would not have pleaded guilty if his
counsel had informed him that (1) he could
be sentenced to life imprisonment as a
result of pleading guilty, (2) the court
could accept his guilty plea even though a
competency evaluation had been requested,
and (3) even if he was found incompetent,
<Page 928>
that would not permanently stop the
proceedings.

<P20>Bansley testified as a legal expert on
behalf of the petitioner and stated that he
had represented several individuals facing
capital murder charges. He then stated
that criminal defendants generally plead
guilty to receive some form of consideration.
He acknowledged that, in a capital
case where the evidence against a defendant
is overwhelming, the best result may
be to plead guilty in exchange for a life
sentence. Bansley also indicated that he
would not recommend that a defendant
plead guilty unless he or she received
some form of consideration for doing so.
He further described the approach of
"frontloading" the mitigation evidence as
having an opportunity to present it twice,
first during the guilt phase and second
during the penalty phase. Bansley explained
that this strategy afforded counsel
the opportunity to present the facts of the
case to a jury over an extended period
time, which would "humanize" the petitioner,
particularly with the use of psychological
evidence, to show "all the difficulties he
had growing up" such as the petitioner's
long-standing mental illness, being abandoned
by his mother several times, and the
physical abuse he suffered from this father.
Bansley expressly opined that, in
general, an attorney should not advise his
or her client to plead guilty if there is no
benefit and, in particular, should
<SPage 591>
not
advise a defendant to plead guilty when
the death penalty remained a potential
sentence.

<P20>Canning testified that he was employed
as a public defender for thirty-nine years
and he had worked on two or three capital
cases before being appointed, along with
Culligan, to represent the petitioner. He
stated that the petitioner pleaded guilty
based on the advice he received from counsel.
Canning could not recall why the petitioner
was advised to plead guilty, and he
"could not imagine what the strategy was
...." Later, he noted that, given the fact
that the state was continuing to pursue the
death penalty, there was no risk of going
to trial at the guilt phase and he could not
identify a benefit to pleading guilty.

<P20>During cross-examination, Canning acknowledged
that, because the state would
not reduce the charges or agree not to
pursue the death penalty, he needed "to
mitigate the damage for [his] client ...."
He admitted that a guilty plea may be
used to elicit "sympathy" for use during
the penalty phase. Finally, Canning acknowledged
that Culligan worked in the
capital felony unit of the public defender's
office and worked on these types of cases
"consistently."

<P20>In his posttrial brief submitted to the
habeas court, the petitioner argued that
his counsel were ineffective in failing to
advise him not to plead guilty because he
did not receive anything in exchange for
such a plea, as he still faced the possibility
of the death penalty. He iterated that the
better approach was to go to trial "because
it would allow the defense to frontload the
mitigation evidence and put some distance
between when you're selecting your jury
and starting the case to when you get to
the penalty phase." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) The respondent, the Commissioner
of Correction, countered, inter
alia, that the petitioner's
<SPage 592>
criminal counsel
"reasonably focused on the penalty
phase of the trial."

<P20>In its memorandum of decision, the
court noted that the state adamantly insisted
on pursuing the death penalty, and,
given the strength of its case and the
weakness of the petitioner's defenses, the
guilt phase was "a poor testbed for any
defense theories." Rather, the petitioner's
counsel focused on the penalty phase. It
further determined that the record indicated
that the petitioner and his counsel used
<Page 929>
the guilty plea as a mitigating factor. The
court explained that the strategy of pleading
guilty, and then using the fact that the
petitioner took responsibility for his actions
and did not force the victim's family
to go through both phases of the criminal
trial, was reasonable and sound. Had the
jury found that the petitioner's decision to
plead guilty constituted a mitigating factor,
the court could not have imposed a
sentence of death. General Statutes (Rev.
to 1991) &sect; 53a-46a(g). The court also disagreed
with Bansley regarding the benefit
of presenting psychological evidence twice
to the fact finder. Specifically, the court
stated: "Two bites at the apple, in this
court's assessment, would not have benefited
the petitioner given the totality of the
circumstances of this case. Furthermore, a
trial in the guilt phase would have removed
an important mitigant from the aggravant
versus mitigant scale that the petitioner
was attempting to tilt in his favor."
Accordingly, the court determined that the
petitioner had failed to demonstrate deficient
performance.

<P20>Additionally, the habeas court concluded
that the petitioner failed to establish prejudice
as a result of his counsel's advice to
plead guilty. The habeas court expressly
discredited the petitioner's testimony,
which it described as inconsistent and
highly selective, that he would not have
pleaded guilty. Further, it stated that the
petitioner failed to demonstrate that the
outcome of the guilt phase would have
been any different, as he
<SPage 593>
did not substantiate
any defenses that, had they been
raised, would have resulted in a better
result for him following the opinion of our
Supreme Court.

<P20>On appeal, the petitioner reasserts
his claim that counsel improperly failed to
advise him against pleading guilty when
the state continued to pursue the death
penalty. He further contends that, because
there was evidence that he was not remorseful
following the shooting of the victim,
and the victim's family had to "suffer
through" the penalty phase of the trial,
pleading guilty in this case did not amount
to a mitigating factor.<fnr6> Finally, the petitioner
argues that he was prejudiced because,
by pleading guilty, he "gave up his
only opportunity to present a defense that
could have led to a conviction of a lesser
offense" on the basis of a diminished capacity
defense. We are not persuaded by
the petitioner's arguments.

<P20>The prejudice prong of the
<EM>Strickland</EM> test has been modified in cases
where the petitioner claims improper advice
from counsel with respect to the decision
to plead guilty. In such cases, the
petitioner satisfies his burden with respect
to prejudice by reasonably demonstrating
that, but for the conduct of counsel, he
would not have pleaded guilty. See
<EM>Williams</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
223 Conn. App. 745, 753, 310 A.3d 381,
cert. denied, 349 Conn. 901, 312 A.3d 586
(2024); see generally <EM>Hill</EM> v. <EM>Lockhart,</EM> 474
U.S. 52, 58-59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d
203 (1985). "However, a petitioner must
make more than a bare allegation that he
would have pleaded differently to demonstrate
prejudice ... because such a statement
suffers from obvious credibility problems
and must be evaluated in light of the
circumstances the defendant would have
faced at the time
<SPage 594>
of his decision." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Williams</EM> v.
<EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra, at 753,
310 A.3d 381; see also <EM>Love</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 223 Conn. App. 658,
667, 308 A.3d 1040, cert. denied, 348 Conn.
958, 310 A.3d 960 (2024).
<Page 930>

<P20>"In evaluating the credibility of
such an assertion [that the petitioner
would not have pleaded guilty], the
strength of the state's case is often the
best evidence of whether a defendant in
fact would have changed his plea and insisted
on going to trial, in light of newly
discovered evidence or a defense strategy
that was not previously contemplated....
Likewise, the credibility of the petitioner's
after the fact insistence that he would have
gone to trial should be assessed in light of
the likely risks that pursuing that course
would have entailed." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Colon</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of
Correction,</EM> 179 Conn. App. 30, 36-37, 177
A.3d 1162 (2017), cert. denied, 328 Conn.
907, 178 A.3d 390 (2018).

<P20>The habeas court discredited
the petitioner's testimony and concluded
that he failed to present any other evidence
that he would not have pleaded
guilty but for the improper advice provided
by counsel.<fnr7> Specifically,
<SPage 595>
it stated:
<Page 931>
"The court also does not credit the petitioner's
testimony, which was inconsistent
and highly selective, that he would not
have pleaded guilty. For example, the petitioner
could not recall his guilty plea and
mental
<SPage 596>
health treatment around the
time of his plea but could completely recall
other aspects of his pretrial process." It is
not the function of this court to second-guess
the credibility determination of the
habeas court with respect to this critical
finding regarding the petitioner's decision
to plead guilty. See <EM>Smith</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 215 Conn. App. 167, 187-89,
282 A.3d 1036, cert. denied, 345 Conn.
921, 284 A.3d 983 (2022). We iterate that
the petitioner must reasonably demonstrate
that, but for the conduct of counsel,
he would not have pleaded guilty. See
<EM>James P.</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
224 Conn. App. 636, 645-46, 312 A.3d 1132
(to establish prejudice, petitioner need
only establish it is reasonably probable
that, but for counsel's deficient performance,
he or she would not have accepted
plea offer and insisted on going to trial),
cert. denied, 349 Conn. 911, 314 A.3d 603
(2024). Additionally, beyond the petitioner's
testimony that he would not have
pleaded guilty, which the habeas court rejected,
the petitioner did not present any
evidence relative to the prejudice prong of
the <EM>Strickland-Hill</EM> test. Further, the state
had a strong case against the petitioner. In
the absence of any other evidence to support
the claim that the petitioner would
not have pleaded guilty, we conclude that,
under these facts and circumstances, he
failed to demonstrate prejudice. See
<EM>Williams</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
supra, 223 Conn. App. at 756, 310 A.3d 381.

<CN>II

<P20>The petitioner next claims that the court
improperly concluded that his counsel
were ineffective in failing to raise a diminished
capacity defense. Specifically, he argues
that counsel were deficient in failing
to investigate adequately this defense,
which would have negated the intent requirement
in a capital murder case, prior
to his guilty plea or to pursue such a
defense during the guilt phase. The respondent
counters, inter alia, that the petitioner
failed to demonstrate that counsel
did
<SPage 597>
not investigate adequately a diminished
capacity defense, and, therefore,
their performance was not deficient. We
agree.

<P20>The following additional facts are necessary
for the resolution of this claim. On
June 9, 1991, days after the shooting, the
petitioner's counsel hired Kenneth Selig, a
psychiatrist, to conduct an "extensive examination"
to assist the defense. Selig concluded
that the petitioner was competent
but had suffered from serious psychological
illnesses for most of his life. Additionally,
Mantell, in his December 9, 1992 letter,
stated that he had examined the petitioner
"for the purpose of mitigation in the event
of his conviction" and found evidence that,
if validated, might have called into question
the petitioner's competence. The petitioner
pleaded guilty the next day, after
Judge Corrigan denied his motion for a
competency evaluation.

<P20>Following his guilty plea, the petitioner
was examined by various psychologists and
other mental health providers. Mantell authored
a psychological report dated April
<Page 932>
17, 1993, in which he concluded: "From
1985 through 1992/93, [the petitioner] has
experienced a significant loss of cognitive
capacity. His profile is also consistent with
the insidious onset of a major, mental disorder.
Because of his significant history of
head trauma, however, subtle brain damage
cannot be ruled out.... <EM>While his
major loss of mental capacity to think, to
make judgments, and to control his impulses,
has not rendered him incompetent,
this loss has, in my professional opinion,
significantly impaired his ability to conform
his conduct to the requirements of
law.</EM>" (Emphasis added.)

<P20>In his amended petition for a writ of
habeas corpus, the petitioner alleged that
his counsel was ineffective in failing to
reasonably investigate, plead, and/or raise
a diminished capacity defense on the basis
of Mantell's
<SPage 598>
evaluations, which had occurred
after he pleaded guilty. The petitioner
argued that there was evidence that
he had suffered severe abuse and neglect,
had a family history of mental illness and
antisocial behavior, had sustained head injuries,
and had experienced a significant
loss of cognitive capacity that impacted his
ability to conform his conduct to the requirements
of law.

<P20>During the habeas trial, Canning acknowledged
that Mantell worked with the
petitioner prior to his guilty plea. Further,
during cross-examination, Canning stated
that he instructed medical professionals to
evaluate his clients for various types of
mental states, including diminished capacity.<fnr8>
Canning further acknowledged that
the medical professionals were not able to
provide an opinion that such a defense was
available in the present case.
<SPage 599>

<P20>In rejecting the petitioner's claim regarding
diminished capacity, the court
summarized the timeline of events in the
present matter. Specifically, it noted that
the underlying offenses were committed on
June 5, 1991, and that counsel hired Selig
on June 9, 1991. Selig conducted an "extensive
examination" of the petitioner to
assist in his defense. The petitioner pleaded
guilty on December 10, 1992, one day
after Mantell had written a letter expressing
a concern regarding the petitioner's
competency. The court further observed
that Bansley, the petitioner's expert, had
acknowledged that the professionals who
evaluated the petitioner had indicated that
any impairment from which he suffered
was not sufficient to the degree necessary
to be a defense to the crime of murder.
<Page 933>

<P20>The court concluded that the petitioner
had "not presented any evidence in the
habeas trial that substantiates he had a
viable diminished capacity defense that
would have resulted in a conviction for a
lesser included offense or an acquittal. <EM>To
the contrary ... the defense left no proverbial
stone unturned.</EM> Unfortunately, the
petitioner was competent and did not have
a supportable defense. The court concludes
that the petitioner has proven neither that
counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate,
plead, and/or raise a diminished
capacity defense, nor that he was prejudiced."
(Emphasis added.)

<P20>On appeal, the petitioner asserts that,
contrary to the conclusions of the court, he
presented evidence demonstrating that he
had a viable diminished capacity defense.
"Specifically, the evidence shows that the
petitioner suffered severe abuse and neglect,
family history of mental illness and
antisocial behavior, had several head injuries,
and had a significant loss of cognitive
capacity that had significantly impaired his
ability to
<SPage 600>
conform his conduct to the
requirements of law." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) The petitioner acknowledges
that his counsel had utilized mental
health experts prior to his guilty plea but
claims much of the evidence regarding a
diminished capacity defense was not developed
and analyzed until after his guilty
plea. "As a result, the petitioner was deprived
of the information he needed to
properly pursue a diminished capacity defense
during the guilt phase."

<P20>"In order for a petitioner to prevail
on a claim of ineffective assistance on
the basis of deficient performance, he must
show that, considering all of the circumstances,
counsel's representation fell below
an objective standard of reasonableness as
measured by prevailing professional
norms.... In any case presenting an ineffectiveness
claim, the performance inquiry
must be whether counsel's assistance was
reasonable considering all the circumstances
.... No particular set of detailed
rules for counsel's conduct can satisfactorily
take account of the variety of circumstances
faced by defense counsel or the
range of legitimate decisions regarding
how best to represent a criminal defendant.
Any such set of rules would interfere
with the constitutionally protected independence
of counsel and restrict the wide
latitude counsel must have in making tactical
decisions....

<P20>"[J]udicial scrutiny of counsel's
performance must be highly deferential. It
is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess
counsel's assistance after conviction
or adverse sentence, and it is all too
easy for a court, examining counsel's defense
after it has proved unsuccessful, to
conclude that a particular act or omission
of counsel was unreasonable .... A fair
assessment of attorney performance requires
that every effort be made to eliminate
the distorting effects of hindsight,
<SPage 601>
to reconstruct the circumstances of
counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate
the conduct from counsel's perspective
at the time. Because of the difficulties
inherent in making the evaluation, a court
must indulge a strong presumption that
counsel's conduct falls within the wide
range of reasonable professional assistance;
that is, the [petitioner] must overcome
the presumption that, under the circumstances,
the challenged action might
be considered sound trial strategy.... Indeed,
our Supreme Court has recognized
that [t]here are countless ways to provide
effective assistance in any given case.
Even the best criminal defense attorneys
would not defend a particular client in the
same way .... [A] reviewing court is required
not simply to give [the trial attorney]
the benefit of the doubt ... but to
affirmatively entertain the range of possible
reasons ... counsel may have had for
<Page 934>
proceeding as [he] did ...." (Emphasis
omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)

220 Conn. App. 285, 305-306, 298
A.3d 636, cert. denied, 348 Conn. 915, 303
A.3d 603 (2023); see also <EM>Williams</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> supra, 223 Conn.
App. at 760-61, 310 A.3d 381.

<P20>Next, we set forth the legal
principles underlying this claim. "`[T]he
specific intent to kill is an essential element
of the crime of murder.'" <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>Bharrat,</EM> 129 Conn. App. 1, 7, 20 A.3d 9,
cert. denied, 302 Conn. 905, 23 A.3d 1243
(2011); see also <EM>Bharrat</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 167 Conn. App. 158, 168, 143
A.3d 1106, cert. denied, 323 Conn. 924, 149
A.3d 982 (2016). The defense of diminished
capacity pertains to this element. See, e.g.,
<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Pagano,</EM> 23 Conn. App. 447, 449,
581 A.2d 1058, cert. denied, 217 Conn. 802,
583 A.2d 132 (1990). Stated differently,
"[t]he doctrine of diminished capacity
means that if the defendant, because of a
limited or impaired mental capacity, did
not have the specific intent to commit the
acts which comprise the crime
<SPage 602>
[charged]
because of a limited or impaired mental
capacity, then the element of intent would
not have been proven in this case." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>J.M.F.,</EM> 170 Conn. App. 120, 183, 154 A.3d
1, cert. denied, 325 Conn. 912, 159 A.3d 230
(2017). Thus, "[e]vidence [regarding a defendant's
mental capacity] is admitted not
for the purpose of exempting a defendant
from criminal responsibility, but as bearing
upon the question of whether he possessed,
at the time he committed the act,
the necessary specific intent, the proof of
which was required to obtain a conviction."
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <EM>State</EM>
v. <EM>Bharrat,</EM> supra, at 7, 20 A.3d 9.

<P20>In the present case, counsel used
the services of Selig to evaluate the petitioner
four days after the shooting of Bagshaw.
Additionally, other medical professionals,
including Mantell, evaluated the
petitioner prior to his guilty plea.<fnr9> Canning
requested that the evaluations include
among other things, whether the petitioner
had a viable diminished capacity defense.
We agree with
<SPage 603>
the habeas court, therefore,
that the petitioner failed to substantiate
his claim of deficient performance on
the basis of failure to raise or investigate a
diminished capacity defense prior to his
guilty plea. Simply put, the petitioner presented
no evidence in the habeas trial to
support his claim. Rather, as the habeas
court observed, "the defense left no proverbial
stone unturned." Specifically, counsel
employed the services of medical professionals
to evaluate the mental status of
<Page 935>
the petitioner, including whether he had a
diminished capacity at the time the crimes
were committed. Following these evaluations,
there was little evidence to support a
diminished capacity defense. Furthermore,
as we previously concluded in this opinion,
counsel then made the strategic choice to
plead guilty in an attempt to present a
mitigating factor to prevent the imposition
of the death penalty.<fnr10> See, e.g., <EM>Bharrat</EM> v.
<EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra, 167
Conn. App. at 167-68, 143 A.3d 1106. For
these reasons, we conclude that the habeas
court properly concluded that the petitioner
failed to establish that his counsel provided
deficient performance with respect
to this issue, and, therefore, this claim
alleging ineffective assistance of counsel
must fail.

<CN>III

<P20>The petitioner next claims that
the court improperly concluded that his
counsel did not provide ineffective assistance
by failing to raise the issue of his
competency at the October 22, 1992 hearing,
at which he elected a three judge
panel for the guilt phase of his criminal
trial, and at the December 10, 1992 hearing,
at which he pleaded guilty.<fnr11> Specifically,
he argues that, as to
<SPage 604>
the former,
his responses to the court's questions during
the canvass indicated that his competency
was in doubt, and therefore his counsel
should have raised this issue at that
time. As to the latter, the petitioner contends
that his counsel should have raised
the issue of his competency to plead guilty
in addition to the claim that he was incompetent
to stand trial. We are not persuaded
by the petitioner's arguments and conclude
that he has failed to demonstrate
prejudice with respect to this claim.

<P20>At the outset, we set forth the
applicable legal principles regarding the
prejudice prong of the <EM>Strickland</EM> standard.
"An evaluation of the prejudice
prong involves a consideration of whether
there is a reasonable probability that, absent
the errors, the [fact finder] would
have had a reasonable doubt respecting
guilt.... A reasonable probability is a
probability sufficient to undermine confidence
in the outcome.... We do not conduct
this inquiry in a vacuum, rather, we
must consider the totality of the evidence
before the judge or jury.... Further, we
are required to undertake an objective review
of the nature and strength of the
state's case .... As our Supreme Court
[has explained], [s]ome errors will have
had pervasive effect on the inferences to
be drawn from the evidence, altering the
entire evidentiary picture, and some will
have had an isolated, trivial effect. Moreover,
a verdict or conclusion only weakly
supported by the record is more likely to
have been affected by errors than one with
overwhelming record support.... [A]
court making the prejudice inquiry must
ask if the [petitioner] has met the burden
of showing that the decision reached would
reasonably likely have been different absent
the errors .... Notably, the petitioner
must meet this burden not by use of speculation
but by demonstrable realities." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Hilton</EM> v.
<EM>Commissioner of</EM>
<SPage 605>
<EM>Correction,</EM> 225 Conn.
App. 309, 327-28, 315 A.3d 1135 (2024).

<P20>Next, we identify the relevant legal
principles regarding the competency of
a criminal defendant. As our Supreme
Court observed in the petitioner's direct
appeal, "[w]e begin with the undisputed
principle that the guilty plea and subsequent
<Page 936>
conviction of an accused person who
is not legally competent to stand trial violates
the due process of law guaranteed by
the state and federal constitutions....
Connecticut jealously guards this right.
Therefore, [t]his constitutional mandate is
codified in [General Statutes (Rev. to
1991)] &sect; 54-56d(a), which provides that [a]
defendant shall not be tried, convicted or
sentenced while he is not competent....

<P20>"[A] defendant is not competent
if he is unable to understand the
proceedings against him or to assist in his
own defense. General Statutes (Rev. to
1991) &sect; 54-56d(a).... [T]he test for competency
must be whether [the defendant]
has sufficient present ability to consult
with his lawyer with a reasonable degree
of rational understanding&mdash;and whether he
has a rational as well as factual understanding
of the proceedings against
him .... Even when a defendant is competent
at the commencement of his trial, a
trial court must always be alert to circumstances
suggesting a change that would
render the accused unable to meet the
standards of competence to stand trial....

<P20>"Although [General Statutes
(Rev. to 1991)] &sect; 54-56d(b) presumes the
competency of defendants, when a reasonable
doubt concerning the defendant's
competency is raised, the trial court must
order a competency examination....
Thus, [a]s a matter of due process, the
trial court is required to conduct an independent
inquiry into the defendant's competence
whenever he makes specific factual
allegations that, if true, would
<SPage 606>
constitute substantial evidence of mental
impairment.... Substantial evidence is
a term of art. Evidence encompasses all
information properly before the court,
whether it is in the form of testimony or
exhibits formally admitted or it is in the
form of medical reports or other kinds of
reports that have been filed with the court.
Evidence is substantial if it raises a reasonable
doubt about the defendant's competency
.... The trial court should carefully
weigh the need for a hearing in each
case, but this is not to say that a hearing
should be available on demand. The decision
whether to grant a hearing requires
the exercise of sound judicial discretion."

of Correction,</EM> 166 Conn. App. 707, 720, 142
A.3d 424 (2016).

<P20>We emphasize, however, that incompetence
is not defined by the presence
of mental illness alone. See <EM>Taylor</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 284 Conn. 433,
451-52, 936 A.2d 611 (2007). A defendant
may have a mental illness and still be able
to understand the charges against him and
assist in his defense. Id.; see also <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>Burgos,</EM> 170 Conn. App. 501, 521, 155 A.3d
246, cert. denied, 325 Conn. 907, 156 A.3d
538 (2017).

<P20>As previously noted, Judge Corrigan
held a hearing on October 22, 1992, to
consider the petitioner's motion to change
his election from a jury trial to a three
judge panel. During this proceeding, the
petitioner stated that he had taken prescription
drugs such as sleeping pills and
body tranquilizers within the prior twelve
hours; nevertheless, he informed Judge
Corrigan that he felt "pretty good." Judge
Corrigan inquired whether the petitioner's
counsel had informed him that the court or
the state could object to the type of fact
finder with respect to the penalty phase,
and he responded: "I don't think so but
I'm pretty much sure the state's going to
do pretty much whatever they want to do.
They've done
<SPage 607>
it from the start, they'll do
it today, and&mdash;I'm just along for the ride."
The petitioner further acknowledged that
he was aware that there was no "automatic
right to a trial, on the penalty phase, to
<Page 937>
... a three judge panel ...." At the conclusion
of the cavass, Judge Corrigan stated:
"In view of the motion and remarks of
the [petitioner] concerning the motion, his
knowledge and apparent competence and
capacity to understand the questioning of
the court&mdash;and the lack of objection by the
state&mdash;and a failure to show any delay in
the course of a trial, the court grants the
motion ...."

<P20>At the start of the December 10, 1992
hearing, counsel moved for an evaluation
pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to
1991) &sect; 54-56d to determine whether the
petitioner was competent to stand trial.
The principal basis for this request was
Mantell's December 9, 1992 letter. The
trial court responded that the petitioner
previously had been determined to be competent
at the October 22, 1992 hearing,
and Mantell's letter did not change that
determination. The motion for such an
evaluation, therefore, was denied. The petitioner
then informed the trial court of his
intention to plead guilty. After the state's
detailed summary of the facts and an extensive
plea canvass, the trial court found
the petitioner's plea was made knowingly,
intelligently, and voluntarily with a full
understanding of the crimes charged, their
possible penalties, and the consequences of
his plea after adequate advice and assistance
of counsel.

<P20>In his direct appeal, the petitioner
claimed that the trial court improperly
denied his motions for a competency examination,
including the one made on December
10, 1992.<fnr12> <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Johnson,</EM> supra,
253 Conn. at 11, 751 A.2d 298. Our
Supreme Court concluded that, although
the trial
<SPage 608>
court had applied an incorrect
evidentiary standard to the requests for
a competency hearing, this error did not
deprive the petitioner of his due process
rights. Id. at 12-13, 751 A.2d 298. Specifically,
it explained that "the trial court
improperly required the [petitioner] to
provide clear and convincing evidence of
incompetency in his motion for a competency
evaluation. Additionally, because
the evidence proffered by the [petitioner]
raised a reasonable doubt as to the [petitioner's]
competency, a competency examination
was justified in this case." Id. at
23-24, 751 A.2d 298.

<P20>Our Supreme Court then considered
whether the denial of a competency examination
deprived the petitioner of his right
to due process because he was incompetent
to stand trial. Id. at 25, 751 A.2d 298.
It determined that the denial of a competency
hearing amounted to harmless error.
Id. At the outset of this analysis, the court
noted that the degree of competency required
to stand trial is the same as the
degree of competency required to plead
guilty. Id. at 26, 751 A.2d 298. "In the
present case, the canvass of the [petitioner]
amply supports the trial court's finding
that the [petitioner] was competent to
plead guilty .... Throughout the canvass
the [petitioner] demonstrated his clear understanding
of the charges against him
and the implications of his guilty plea. The
[petitioner] provided appropriate and coherent
responses to the court's questions
and indicated that he had consulted with
defense counsel regarding various aspects
of his guilty plea. Furthermore, the [petitioner]
paused repeatedly during the
lengthy canvass to consult with counsel
before answering specific questions. Thus,
the record of the canvass establishes that
the [petitioner] comprehended the proceedings
and was able to consult with and
assist counsel in the presentation of his
case. Accordingly, the [petitioner] was
<Page 938>
competent to plead guilty .... Thus, the
trial court's extensive canvass of the [petitioner],
prior to accepting his guilty plea,
<SPage 609>
necessarily included a determination
that the [petitioner] was competent....
Because the same competency standard
applied to both determinations and because
the canvass occurred immediately
after defense counsel raised the issue of
competency, implicit in the trial court's
conclusion that the [petitioner] was competent
to plead guilty is its finding that the
[petitioner] was also competent to stand
trial." (Citations omitted; footnotes omitted;
internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.
at 27-29, 751 A.2d 298.

<CN>A

<P20>In the present case, the petitioner
claims that his counsel were ineffective in
not raising the issue of his competency to
plead guilty at the October 22, 1992 proceeding.
In rejecting this claim, the court
concluded that it "does not agree that the
October 22 transcript supports the contention
that the petitioner was not competent.
The petitioner clearly told the court that
he felt `pretty good.' ... The petitioner
has not shown that counsel were deficient
for failing to object to the October 22
canvass, which only has a tangential connection
to the actual guilty pleas, nor that
he was prejudiced. The claim of ineffective
assistance of counsel must fail."

<P20>On appeal, the petitioner asserts that his
responses during the October 22, 1992 canvass
demonstrated that "this competency
was at best questionable ...." As a result,
he contends, counsel should have raised
the competency issue at this proceeding.
The petitioner further argues that, "[a]t
the very least, calling into question the
petitioner's competency during the October
22, 1992 canvass would have made it
more difficult for the trial court to rely on
it during [his] later plea. In other words, if
the petitioner's competency was in doubt
during the October 22, 1992 canvass, the
trial court cannot then rely on that canvass
as proof and
<SPage 610>
evidence that [he] was
competent during his December 10, 1992
plea canvass." The respondent counters
that the petitioner's counsel had no evidence
to support this claim at the October
22, 1992 proceeding. With respect to the
prejudice prong, the respondent claims,
inter alia, that, even if counsel had raised
the competency issue at the October 22,
1992 hearing, the court likely would not
have ordered an examination and, if it had,
the petitioner would not have been found
incompetent. We agree with the respondent
that the petitioner failed to demonstrate
prejudice and, therefore, this claim
of ineffective assistance of counsel must
fail.

<P20>During the October 22, 1992 proceeding,
the petitioner, in response to a question
from the court as to whether he recently
had taken any medication, alcohol or
drugs, stated that he had taken "sleeping
pills, body tranquilizers ... things to help
me sleep" within the past twelve hours.
The petitioner then asserted that he "felt
pretty good," did not have any problems
hearing the court, and was able to understand
the court's questions. After a further
colloquy regarding the election of a three
judge panel for the guilt phase of his criminal
trial, Judge Corrigan concluded: "In
view of the motion and remarks of the
[petitioner] concerning the motion, his
knowledge and <EM>apparent competency and
a capacity to understanding the questions</EM>
... the court grants the motion ...."
(Emphasis added.)

<P20>"Connecticut appellate courts have repeatedly
held that a trial court may not be
required to order a competency examination
when the defendant's canvass supports
a finding of competency." <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>Silva,</EM> 65 Conn. App. 234, 249, 783 A.2d 7,
cert. denied, 258 Conn. 929, 783 A.2d 1031
(2001); see also <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>DesLaurier,</EM> 230
<Page 939>
Conn. 572, 590, 646 A.2d 108 (1994). Indeed,
this court specifically has recognized
that "[t]he trial judge is in
<SPage 611>
a particularly
advantageous position to observe a defendant's
conduct during a trial and has a
unique opportunity to assess a defendant's
competency. A trial court's opinion, therefore,
of the competency of a defendant is
highly significant." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Ducharme,</EM> 134
Conn. App. 595, 602, 39 A.3d 1183, cert.
denied, 305 Conn. 905, 44 A.3d 181 (2012).

<P20>Furthermore, had defense counsel
requested a competency examination, the
petitioner would have been required to
present substantial evidence that raised a
reasonable doubt about his competency,
rather than mere allegations of incompetency.
See <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Kendall,</EM> 123 Conn.
App. 625, 650-51, 2 A.3d 990, cert. denied,
299 Conn. 902, 10 A.3d 521 (2010). He
failed to present any such evidence to the
habeas court that would have supported
his contention that he likely would have
been found incompetent at the October 22,
1992 hearing. We emphasize that the petitioner
bears the burden of demonstrating
prejudice not with mere speculation but
rather with "`demonstrable realties.'" <EM>Hilton</EM>
v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra,
225 Conn. App. at 328, 315 A.3d 1135. For
these reasons, we conclude that this claim
of ineffective assistance counsel with respect
to the October 22, 1992 hearing must
fail.

<CN>B

<P20>Next, we consider the petitioner's
claim that his counsel were ineffective in
failing to object to his pleading guilty at
the December 10, 1992 proceeding on the
basis of lack of competency. He acknowledges
that, at this hearing, his counsel
claimed that he was incompetent to stand
trial but asserts that they also should have
raised the issue of, and challenged, his
competency to plead guilty. The respondent
counters, inter alia, that, because our
Supreme Court determined that the petitioner's
rights to due process were not
violated by the
<SPage 612>
determination of the
criminal court that he was competent to
stand trial, and that the same measure of
competency applied to the evaluation of his
guilty plea, which was made at the same
time, the petitioner cannot establish prejudice.
We agree.

<P20>At the outset of the December 10, 1992
proceeding, the petitioner's counsel moved
for a competency evaluation pursuant to
General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) &sect; 54-56d.
The basis of this motion was Mantell's
December 9, 1992 letter. As noted, Judge
Corrigan remarked that he had found the
petitioner to be competent at the October
22, 1992 proceeding and that Mantell's letter
did not alter that conclusion. Judge
Corrigan ultimately denied counsel's motion
for a competency examination.

<P20>On appeal, our Supreme Court explained
that the standard of competency to stand
trial was the same degree of competency
required to plead guilty. <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Johnson,</EM>
supra, 253 Conn. at 26, 751 A.2d 298. It
further determined that the December 10,
1992 canvass supported the court's finding
that the petitioner was competent to plead
guilty. Id. at 27, 751 A.2d 298. Furthermore,
"[b]ecause the same competency
standard applied to both determinations
and because the canvass occurred immediately
after defense counsel raised the issue
of competency, implicit in the trial court's
conclusion that the [petitioner] was competent
to plead guilty is its finding that the
[petitioner] was also competent to stand
trial." Id. at 29, 751 A.2d 298.

<P20>Our Supreme Court previously determined
that the petitioner was competent at
the time of his December 10, 1992 guilty
plea. The petitioner has not presented any
<Page 940>
additional evidence regarding his competency,
or lack thereof, on December 10,
1992. As a result, he has failed to sustain
his burden of establishing prejudice by
demonstrable realities. Accordingly, this
claim of ineffective assistance of counsel
fails.
<SPage 613>

<CN>IV

<P20>The petitioner finally claims that the
court improperly concluded that counsel
did not provide ineffective assistance when
they incorrectly advised him that the court
would not accept his guilty plea after the
issue of his competency had been raised at
the same proceeding.<fnr13> Specifically, he argues
that, as a result of this advice, his
plea was not knowingly, intelligently and
voluntarily made. The respondent contends,
inter alia, that the factual predicate
for this claim, that counsel informed the
petitioner that the court could not accept
his plea after requesting a competency
evaluation, did not exist and that he failed
to demonstrate prejudice because, despite
any such purportedly improper advice, the
"petitioner made the personal decision to
plead guilty to spare the victim's family
any added grief and to use such a plea as a
mitigating factor at sentencing."<fnr14> We
agree with the respondent that the petitioner
has failed to establish the factual
predicate for this claim, and therefore it
fails.

<P20>During the habeas trial, the petitioner
testified that he "was advised that if [he
pleaded] guilty that there would be no way
that the court would accept a guilty plea
from a person whose competency has been
raised [previously]." The petitioner also
stated that he pleaded guilty on the advice
of counsel, but they did not inform him
that, as a result, he could be sentenced to
life imprisonment or that he was waiving
his right to appeal any issues arising during
the guilt phase. Finally, the petitioner
claimed that, had counsel explained that
the court could accept the plea even
though a competency
<SPage 614>
evaluation had
been requested, he would not have pleaded
guilty.

<P20>Canning testified that he could not remember
why he advised the petitioner to
plead guilty and thought that he would
have been ready to proceed to a trial if
necessary. He could not recall whether he
advised the petitioner that the court would
not accept his guilty plea because a request
for a competency evaluation had
been made at the same proceeding, although
there was a "good possibility that
that actually happened."

<P20>After considering the evidence, the court
rejected the petitioner's testimony that he
did not want to plead guilty. It concluded
that there was no evidence to support the
petitioner's contention that he was not
competent. Furthermore, the court specifically
discredited the petitioner's testimony
that counsel had told him that the court
would not accept his guilty plea after the
competency issue was raised. The court
further noted that Canning's testimony regarding
this issue was "highly speculative
at best and not based on clear recollections
of events that transpired about thirty
years ago." The habeas court also noted
<Page 941>
that Canning had testified that he had
discussed entering a guilty plea with the
petitioner. Finally, it concluded: "There
being no credible evidence that counsel
was ineffective for advising the petitioner
that the court would not accept his guilty
plea, this final basis must also be denied.
The petitioner has neither shown the required
deficient performance nor how he
was prejudiced."

<P20>This court must defer to the
habeas court's weighing of the facts and
determinations of credibility. See <EM>LaSalle</EM>
v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 227 Conn.
App. 520, 528, 321 A.3d 499 (2024); <EM>Angel
C.</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 226
Conn. App. 837, 848, 319 A.3d 168, cert.
denied, 350 Conn. 908, 323 A.3d 1091
(2024). Here, the habeas court disbelieved
the petitioner's testimony
<SPage 615>
that his counsel
had told him that the trial court would
not accept his guilty plea after there was a
request for a competency evaluation. The
factual predicate for his claim, therefore,
does not exist. Furthermore, as we have
noted previously in this opinion, the petitioner
failed to sustain his burden of demonstrating
prejudice by establishing that
he would not have pleaded guilty had he
been advised as he claims he should have
been. For these reasons, we conclude that
this claim is without merit.

<P20>The judgment is affirmed.

<P20>In this opinion the other judges
concurred.
<FN>
<fnt1> General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) &sect; 54-82(b)
provides: "If the accused is charged with a
crime punishable by death or imprisonment
for life and elects to be tried by the court, the
court shall be composed of three judges consisting
of the judge presiding at the session
and two other judges to be designated by the
chief justice. Such judges, or a majority of
them, shall have power to decide all questions
of law and fact arising upon the trial and
render judgment accordingly."

<fnt2> The December 9, 1992 letter from Mantell
stated: "I have examined [the petitioner] since
November 25 exploring child and family development
issues for the purpose of mitigation
in the event of his conviction.

<P20>"During my first examination of [the petitioner]
on 11/25/92 but particularly during
those this morning and this afternoon, I have
found symptomatic evidence of psychotic
thought process <EM>which, if validated, may severely
impact on</EM> [the petitioner's] <EM>present legal
competence.</EM>

<P20>"After reviewing my results with you and
Attorney Canning today I learned that this
information is new and not previously known.
It was not part of the background data or
findings given to me before or since I began
my study.

<P20>"The conclusion expressed above was
promptly relayed telephonically to you and to
Attorney Canning from the Hartford Correctional
Center this afternoon." (Emphasis added.)

<fnt3> During a colloquy with the trial court, the
petitioner stated that he was at the Land and
Sea Sports Center in the early morning hours
of June 5, 1991, where he committed a burglary,
and he recognized the arrival of a police
cruiser and a police officer. He further
stated: "I shot at a police cruiser and caused
the death of a police officer." He also admitted
that it was his intention to shoot at the
cruiser and cause the death of the officer
inside.

<fnt4> Our Supreme Court explained that, "[u]nder
[the then existing] capital offense sentencing
scheme, a capital defendant may not be
sentenced to death unless the state establishes
the existence of an aggravating factor beyond
a reasonable doubt, and the defendant fails to
establish a mitigating factor by a preponderance
of the evidence.... In the present case,
the jury rejected the aggravating factor of
`especially depraved,' but did find as an aggravating
factor that the [petitioner] had committed
the offense of capital felony in an `especially
cruel and heinous manner.' ... The
jury's verdict also indicated that it had found
no mitigating factor." (Citations omitted.)
<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Johnson,</EM> supra, 253 Conn. at 56, 751
A.2d 298.

<fnt5> This is an unusually frank and troubling
admission.

<fnt6> The fact that the state presented evidence
during the penalty phase that the petitioner
was neither remorseful nor accepting of responsibility
for his actions did not render
counsel's strategy deficient. See footnote 7 of
this opinion.

<fnt7> To prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance
of counsel, the petitioner must prevail
on both prongs of the <EM>Strickland-Hill</EM> test, and
a court may decide against a petitioner on
either prong, whichever is easier. See
<EM>Williams</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra,
223 Conn. App. at 752-53, 310 A.3d 381.
In the present case, the habeas court concluded
that the petitioner's counsel were not deficient
in their strategy to plead guilty and
focus on the penalty phase due to the strength
of the state's case and the comparative weakness
of the petitioner's defenses and that the
petitioner was not prejudiced. Contrary to the
petitioner's assertion that there was "no conceivable
benefit to pleading guilty," counsel
sought to use the guilty plea as a mitigation
factor. General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) &sect; 53a-46a(c)
placed the burden of establishing a
mitigating factor on the petitioner, <EM>while subsections
(f) and (g) provided that if a mitigating
factor existed, then the court shall not impose
the sentence of death.</EM>

<P20>The habeas court referred to Canning's
closing argument during the penalty phase, in
which he attempted to persuade the three
judge panel that the petitioner's guilty plea
constituted a "responsible act" and thus a
mitigating factor. As noted in the respondent's
appellate brief, courts have acknowledged the
reasonableness of such a strategy. See, e.g.,
<EM>Post</EM> v. <EM>Bradshaw,</EM> 621 F.3d 406, 417-18 (6th
Cir. 2010) (advice to plead no contest was not
deficient performance when state's case was
so strong that conviction was essentially assured
and sentencing court would not hear
adverse testimony and petitioner gained mitigating
factor), cert. denied, 563 U.S. 1009,

(M.D. Tenn. 2008) (petitioner's trial counsel,
who were experienced in capital cases and
clearly aware of state's overwhelming evidence
and hampered by petitioner's public
statements and interviews admitting to several
murders, made reasonable strategic decision

and crime heinous, and may be
tactically advantageous choice within <EM>Strickland</EM>),
cert. denied, 357 Or. 324, 354 P.3d 696
(2015).

<P20>The United States Supreme Court has stated
that "[c]ounsel therefore may reasonably
decide to focus on the trial's penalty phase, at
which time counsel's mission is to persuade
the trier that his client's life should be spared.
Unable to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange
for a life sentence, defense counsel must
strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive
course.... In this light, counsel cannot
be deemed ineffective for attempting to
impress the jury with his candor and his
unwillingness to engage in a useless charade
.... <EM>To summarize, in a capital case,
counsel must consider in conjunction both the
guilt and penalty phases in determining how
best to proceed.</EM>" (Citations omitted; emphasis
added; internal quotation marks omitted.)
<EM>Florida</EM> v. <EM>Nixon,</EM> 543 U.S. 175, 191-92, 125
S. Ct. 551, 160 L. Ed. 2d 565 (2004).

<P20>In the present case, the petitioner's counsel
made the informed strategic decision to plead
guilty in the face of overwhelming evidence
and to focus on establishing a mitigating factor
to avoid the death penalty. We conclude
that this approach did not constitute constitutionally
deficient performance and, therefore,
this claim of ineffective assistance of counsel
must fail. The petitioner, therefore, has not
sustained his burden with respect to either
prong of the <EM>Strickland-Hill</EM> test on this claim.

<fnt8> Specifically, the following colloquy occurred:

<B42>"[The Respondent's Counsel]: And fair to
say that when you do that in death penalty
cases or any case, your instructions to the
medical professional are pretty much, evaluate
this guy for [extreme emotional disturbance],
diminished capacity, insanity; give me
something I can work with. Correct?

<B42>"Canning: Yes.

<B42>"[The Respondent's Counsel]: Okay. And
that would have been the same especially in
this case. Wouldn't it have been?

<B42>"Canning: Yes.

<B42>"[The Respondent's Counsel]: And at some
point after those evaluations, you notified the
court that you had no intent to file a mental
status defense on behalf of your client. Right?

<B42>"Canning: I don't recall that, but I would
certainly say that we did not file it.

<B42>"[The Respondent's Counsel]: That you did
not file for a mental disease or defect alibi
or&mdash; excuse me&mdash;defense. Correct?

<B42>"Canning: Correct.

<B42>"[The Respondent's Counsel]: And that
would have been that because, in part, your
doctors were not able to provide you with
such a defense, were they?

<B42>"Canning: That's true.

<B42>"[The Respondent's Counsel]: So, at that
point, your only option is to take what your
doctors have given you concerning the mental
state of your client and attempt to use it at the
penalty phase?

<B42>"Canning: Well, that's one possibility."

<fnt9> We note that the list of exhibits from the
habeas trial indicates that the reports of various
medical providers are for identification
only. At the start of the habeas trial, the
petitioner's counsel indicated that she was not
sure if the reports she had were, in fact, the
same as those entered into evidence during
the guilt phase of the petitioner's criminal
trial. The habeas court agreed to leave the
hearing open for a period of time to allow the
petitioner's counsel to locate and confirm that
these reports were admitted into evidence at
the criminal trial.

<P20>On January 27, 2022, the habeas court issued
the following order: "The petitioner
lodged additional documents under seal on a
flash drive pursuant to court order. The documents
are from the petitioner's underlying
criminal trial and replace certain of the petitioner's
exhibits that were marked for identification
at the habeas trial on [November 10,
2021]. The exhibits marked for identification
in the habeas trial remain marked for identification
only. The lodged documents are
marked full exhibits in the habeas trial [including
the sealed reports of Anne Phillips
and Peter Zeman]. The exhibits listed herein
are sealed pursuant to the protective order,
attached hereto, issued by <EM>Newson, J.,</EM> on [December
23, 2021]. Until further order of the
court, the exhibits listed in this order shall
remain sealed and are available only to the
parties, their counsel and the court."

<fnt10> We note that, during the penalty phase, the
jury rejected the petitioner's claim of diminished
capacity as a mitigating factor. See
General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) &sect; 53a-46a(g).

<fnt11> We recognize that an individual's competence
may fluctuate over a period of time.
See, e.g., <EM>In re Kaleb H.,</EM> 306 Conn. 22, 34
n.11, 48 A.3d 631 (2012).

<fnt12> Our Supreme Court also considered the
petitioner's arguments regarding the competency
issue raised on March 3, 4 and 9, 1993.
<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Johnson,</EM> supra, 253 Conn. at 29-31,
751 A.2d 298.

<fnt13> To the extent that the petitioner also argues
that his counsel's purportedly improper
advice caused him to plead guilty to a capital
offense without receiving any benefit, we have
considered and rejected this contention in
part I of this opinion.

<fnt14> We note that, despite this claim, as discussed
previously, the petitioner was thoroughly
canvassed by the trial court before his
guilty plea was accepted.

<P20>In these consolidated appeals, the defendants
Alex Emric Jones and Free
Speech Systems, LLC,<fnr1> appeal from the
judgments of the trial court rendered following
jury verdicts returned in favor of
the plaintiffs<fnr2>
<SPage 491>
in the underlying consolidated
tort actions<fnr3> arising out of the 2012
mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary
School in Newtown. On appeal, the defendants
claim that the court improperly (1)
defaulted them as a sanction for violating
certain discovery orders and a protective
order, (2) construed the effect of the default
to relieve the plaintiffs of the burden
to prove the extent of their damages, (3)
restricted the scope of Jones' testimony at
the hearing in damages, (4) denied their
motion for a remittitur, and (5) concluded
that the plaintiffs' claim asserting a violation
of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices
Act (CUTPA), General Statutes &sect; 42-110a
et seq., was legally sufficient. For the
reasons that follow, we disagree with the
defendants' first, second, and fourth
claims, and deem the defendants' third
claim to be abandoned as inadequately
briefed. We agree, however, with the defendants'
fifth claim. Accordingly, we reverse
in part the judgments of the trial
court.
<Page 951>

<P20>The following facts and procedural history,
as set forth previously by this court or
as were undisputed in the record, are relevant
to our resolution of these appeals.
"On December 14, 2012, Adam Lanza entered
Sandy Hook Elementary School
(Sandy Hook), and thereafter shot and
killed twenty first-grade children and six
adults, in addition to wounding two other
victims who survived the attack. In the
underlying consolidated actions, the plaintiffs,
consisting of a first responder, who
was not a victim of the Sandy Hook shooting
but was depicted in the media following
the
<SPage 492>
shooting, and the immediate
family members of five of the children, one
educator, the principal of Sandy Hook, and
a school psychologist who were killed in
the shooting, brought these separate actions
....

<P20>"In the complaints, the plaintiffs alleged
that [Jones] hosts a nationally syndicated
radio program and owns and operates multiple
Internet websites that hold themselves
out as news and journalism platforms.
The plaintiffs further alleged that
[Jones] began publishing content related
to the Sandy Hook shooting on his radio
and Internet platforms and circulated videos
on his YouTube channel. Specifically,
the plaintiffs alleged that, between December
19, 2012, and June 26, 2017, [Jones]
used his Internet and radio platforms to
spread the message that the Sandy Hook
shooting was a staged event to the millions
of his weekly listeners and subscribers.
The complaints each consisted of five
counts, including causes of action sounding
in invasion of privacy by false light, defamation
and defamation per se, intentional
infliction of emotional distress, negligent
infliction of emotional distress, and a violation
of [CUTPA]." (Citation omitted.) <EM>Lafferty</EM>
v. <EM>Jones,</EM> 222 Conn. App. 855, 859-60,
307 A.3d 923 (2023).

<P20>On November 15, 2021, the trial court,
<EM>Bellis, J.,</EM> defaulted the defendants as a
sanction for violating (1) certain discovery
orders and (2) a protective order. Thereafter,
the issue of damages was tried to a
jury. In the midst of the hearing in damages,
with the defendants' consent, the
plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting
four counts, each of which was
accompanied by a claim of civil conspiracy:
(1) invasion of privacy by false light; (2)
defamation and defamation per se; (3) intentional
infliction of emotional distress;
and (4) a violation of CUTPA.<fnr4> On October
12, 2022,
<SPage 493>
the jury returned a verdict in
favor of the plaintiffs, awarding them a
total of $965,000,000 in compensatory damages.
The jury further awarded the plaintiffs
reasonable attorney's fees and costs,
with the amounts to be determined by the
court at a later date. On November 10,
2022, the court awarded the plaintiffs a
total of (1) $321,650,000 in common-law
punitive damages in the form of attorney's
fees, (2) $1,489,555.94 in costs, and (3)
$150,000,000 in statutory punitive damages
pursuant to CUTPA. The defendants filed
motions to set aside the verdict and for a
remittitur, which the court denied on December
22, 2022. These consolidated appeals
followed. Additional facts and procedural
history will be set forth as necessary.

<P20>Before turning to the defendants' claims,
we note that the plaintiffs argue that "[a]lmost
all of [the defendants'] claims of error
are so general or so inadequately
briefed that they are waived." We iterate
that we deem claims on appeal to be abandoned
<Page 952>
if they are inadequately briefed.
See, e.g., <EM>Lafferty</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM> 336 Conn. 332,
375 n.30, 246 A.3d 429 (2020) ("We repeatedly
have stated that [w]e are not
required to review issues that have been
improperly presented to this court through
an inadequate brief.... Analysis, rather
than mere abstract assertion, is required
in order to avoid abandoning an issue by
failure to brief the issue properly....
[F]or this court judiciously and efficiently
to consider claims of error raised on appeal
... the parties must clearly and fully
set forth their arguments in their
briefs.... The parties may not merely cite
a legal principle without analyzing the relationship
between the facts of the case
and the law cited." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.)), cert. denied, ___ U.S.
___, 141 S.Ct. 2467, 209 L.Ed. 2d 529
(2021). As we explain throughout this opinion,
we decline to review any
<SPage 494>
claims that
the defendants have abandoned as a result
of inadequate briefing.

<CN>I

<P20>The defendants first claim that the trial
court improperly defaulted them as a sanction
for violating certain discovery orders,
as well as a discovery related protective
order. We disagree.

<P20>The following additional facts and procedural
history are relevant to our resolution
of this claim. Shortly after the underlying
consolidated actions had been commenced,
the Jones defendants filed special motions
to dismiss the actions pursuant to Connecticut's
anti-SLAPP<fnr5> statute. See General
Statutes &sect; 52-196a (b).<fnr6> The plaintiffs
moved for limited discovery vis-&agrave;-vis the
special motions to dismiss; see General
Statutes &sect; 52-196a (d); which the court
granted on December 17, 2018.

<P20>On January 10, 2019, the court overruled
objections raised by the Jones defendants
to the plaintiffs' requests for production
seeking, inter alia, marketing data, sales
analytics, and web analytics that the Jones
defendants "own[ed] and/or control[led]."
On May 7, 2019, in an objection addressing
various discovery issues, the Jones defendants
represented that they had "provided
all of the analytics, business and marketing
plans that they have." On May 29, 2019,
the plaintiffs moved to compel compliance
with the court's discovery orders, asserting
in part that the Jones defendants had
failed to produce responsive marketing
and analytics information. The plaintiffs
referred, in particular, to marketing
<SPage 495>
data generated by Google Analytics<fnr7> in
the custody and control of the Jones defendants,
and argued that a thirty-five page
Google Analytics document provided by
the Jones defendants was inadequate.

<P20>On June 10, 2019, the court issued an
order stating that (1) testimony elicited
during certain depositions confirmed that a
"Google Analytics account is accessed and
utilized by some employees of the [Jones]
defendants," (2) the Google Analytics document
that the Jones defendants had produced
did not constitute full and fair compliance
with the court's discovery orders,
and (3) the plaintiffs were "entitled to the
[Google Analytics] data pursuant to the
<Page 953>
court's discovery orders." The court further
ordered that it would "consider appropriate
sanctions for the [Jones] defendants'
failure to fully and fairly comply
should they not produce the data within
one week." Subsequently, the Jones defendants
represented that, on June 17, 2019,
Google Analytics data purportedly had
been emailed to the plaintiffs' counsel;
however, the plaintiffs' counsel represented
that the email was never received.

<P20>On June 17, 2019, the plaintiffs moved
for the court to review a June 14, 2019
broadcast of Jones' radio program, during
which Jones made threatening comments
with respect to one of the plaintiffs' counsel.
See <EM>Lafferty</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM> supra, 336 Conn.
at 342-46, 370, 246 A.3d 429. On June 18,
2019, after finding that (1) the Jones defendants
were noncompliant with the
court's discovery orders concerning, inter
alia, the Google Analytics data, and (2)
Jones had harassed, intimidated, and
threatened one of the plaintiffs' counsel
during the June 14, 2019
<SPage 496>
broadcast, the
court sanctioned the Jones defendants by
depriving them of the opportunity to pursue
their special motions to dismiss. Id. at
346-47, 374, 246 A.3d 429. At the outset of
its decision, the court also stated: "[T]he
discovery in this case has been marked
with obfuscation and delay on the part of
the [Jones] defendants, who, despite several
court-ordered deadlines ... [have] continue[d]
... to object to having to, what
they call affirmatively gather and produce
documents which might help the plaintiffs
make their case. Despite over approximately
a dozen discovery status conferences
and several court-ordered discovery
deadlines, the Jones defendants have still
not fully and fairly complied with their
discovery obligations.... The [court has]
entered discovery deadlines, extended discovery
deadlines, and discovery deadlines
have been disregarded by the Jones defendants,
who continue to object to their discovery
and [have] failed to produce that
which is within their knowledge, possession,
or power to obtain." Later, the court
further stated: "At this point, I decline to
default the ... Jones defendants, but I
will&mdash;I don't know how clearly I can say
this.... As the discovery in this case
progresses, if there is continued obfuscation
and delay and tactics like I've seen up
to this point, I will not hesitate after a
hearing and an opportunity to be heard to
default the ... Jones defendants if they,
from this point forward, continue with
their behavior with respect to discovery."
On July 10, 2020, following Chief Justice
Richard A. Robinson's grant of the Jones
defendants' petition for an expedited public
interest appeal pursuant to General
Statutes &sect; 52-265a, our Supreme Court
affirmed the trial court's sanction orders.
<EM>Lafferty</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM> supra, at 336 n.3, 385,
246 A.3d 429.

<P20>On November 12, 2020, the plaintiffs
moved to again compel compliance with
court-ordered discovery.<fnr8> On
<SPage 497>
May 5,
2021, the Jones defendants filed an objection,
arguing in part that the plaintiffs'
prior discovery requests had been rendered
moot as a result of the court's June
18, 2019 sanction orders precluding the
Jones defendants from pursuing their special
motions to dismiss.<fnr9> On May 14, 2021,
the court issued an order stating that "the
obligation of the [Jones] defendants to fully
and fairly comply with the discovery
requests at issue was not extinguished by
the fact that the [Jones] defendants have
<Page 954>
been precluded from pursuing special motions
to dismiss."

<P20>On June 1, 2021, the Jones defendants
filed an emergency motion for a protective
order requesting that the court (1) extend
an upcoming discovery production deadline
by forty-five days and (2) narrow the scope
of discovery regarding, inter alia, the Google
Analytics data, which, they represented,
required them to review nearly 300,000
emails for privileged information. On June
2, 2021, the court issued an order stating:
"The court previously entered numerous
orders with respect to this discovery request
and the Jones defendants' objections
thereto. The court declines the Jones defendants'
invitation to address, again, the
scope of appropriate discovery. With respect
to the timeframe for compliance, the
outstanding discovery responses were due
over two years ago. At no point in time
following the decision [in <EM>Lafferty</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM>
supra, 336 Conn. 332, 246 A.3d 429] did the
Jones defendants seek clarification from
the court as to their discovery obligations.
According to emails produced by the plaintiffs
... the Jones defendants, in February
and March of 2020, while their case was
pending before [our] Supreme Court and a
court-ordered stay of discovery was in effect,
asked the plaintiffs' counsel for a
complete set of discovery requests to
<SPage 498>
date and continued to discuss the outstanding
discovery that was owed by the
Jones defendants. Nowhere in the email
chain did counsel for the Jones defendants
indicate that they were compiling their
discovery only if they prevailed on their
appeal. The plaintiffs filed a motion with
the court seeking the overdue compliance
on November 12, 2020, and the Jones defendants
did not even file an objection
until May 5, 2021. The court's ruling of
May 14, 2021, confirmed that the outstanding
discovery from the Jones defendants
was overdue. At this point, the [Jones]
defendants are not in compliance with
their obligation to produce that discovery
which is in their knowledge, possession, or
power. To the extent that [the Jones defendants']
motion seeks, at this late date, a
further extension of time to produce the
already overdue supplemental compliance,
it is granted as follows: complete, final
supplemental compliance must be made by
June 28, 2021, with compliance to begin
immediately on a rolling basis. Failure to
comply with this order may result in sanctions
including but not limited to a default."

<P20>On June 28, 2021, the Jones defendants
filed a notice of compliance indicating that
(1) the defendants had provided "complete,
final supplemental compliance," and (2) Infowars,
LLC, Infowars Health, LLC, and
Prison Planet TV, LLC, previously had
satisfied their discovery obligations. With
regard to the Google Analytics data, the
Jones defendants represented that (1) only
Free Speech Systems, LLC, used Google
Analytics, (2) Free Speech Systems, LLC,
did not possess, control, or have custody of
Google Analytics data in a manner allowing
the data to be exported,<fnr10> and (3) the
only reasonable method of sharing the
Google Analytics data would
<SPage 499>
be to permit
the plaintiffs' counsel to access it via a
"`sandbox.'"<fnr11>

<P20>On July 1, 2021, Free Speech Systems,
LLC, Infowars Health, LLC, and Prison
<Page 955>
Planet TV, LLC, through one of their
counsel, Attorney Norman A. Pattis of
Pattis & Smith, LLC,<fnr12> filed a motion for a
commission to take an out-of-state deposition
of Hillary Clinton (motion to depose
Clinton).<fnr13> These defendants asserted in
relevant part that, (1) during one of the
plaintiffs' depositions, (a) on the advice of
counsel, the deponent refused to answer
how the plaintiffs "all ended up represented
by the same [law] firm" in the underlying
consolidated actions and (b) claimed to
be unaware of how her legal fees were
being paid, (2) the lead plaintiff in the
underlying consolidated actions was invited
to speak at the Democratic National Convention
in 2016, and thereafter was
"praised" by Clinton, and (3) they "believe[d]
that [the underlying consolidated
actions were] filed six years after the
shootings at Sandy Hook as part of a
vendetta inspired, orchestrated and directed
in whole or in part by ... Clinton as
part of a vendetta to silence ... Jones
after ... Clinton lost the presidential race
to Donald J. Trump."

<P20>On July 6, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a
motion to sanction the Jones defendants
for violating a protective
<SPage 500>
order entered
on February 22, 2019, as amended on June
16, 2021 (protective order),<fnr14> which originally
had been proposed by the Jones defendants
and which, inter alia, protected
confidential information produced by the
plaintiffs during discovery.<fnr15> The plaintiffs
maintained that the motion to depose Clinton,
filed by the Jones defendants<fnr16> in the
middle of a deposition, (1) was frivolous
and (2) improperly published information
obtained from the deponent's testimony
that was designated as "Highly Confidential-Attorneys
Eyes Only" in violation of
the protective order. On July 19, 2021,
Free Speech Systems, LLC, Infowars,
LLC, Infowars Health, LLC, and Prison
Planet TV, LLC, filed an objection, and
the plaintiffs filed a reply brief the next
day.

<P20>On August 5, 2021, the court issued an
order stating in relevant part: "In the
midst of taking the first deposition of a
<Page 956>
plaintiff ... Free Speech Systems, LLC,
Infowars, LLC, Infowars Health, LLC,
and Prison Planet TV, LLC (Infowars),
filed a motion to depose ... Clinton, using
deposition testimony that had just been
designated as `[Highly] Confidential-Attorneys
Eyes Only,'
<SPage 501>
and completely disregarding
the court-ordered procedures. At
no point prior to filing the Clinton motion
did Infowars profess ignorance of the procedures
they had proposed and which were
court-ordered to be followed, nor have
they since taken any steps to correct their
improper filing. If Infowars was of the
opinion that the plaintiffs' designation was
unreasonable and not made in good faith,
the solution was to follow the court-ordered
procedure to challenge the designation,
not to blatantly disregard it and make
the confidential information available on
the Internet by filing it in the court file.
The court rejects Infowars' baseless argument
that there was no good cause to issue
the protective [order].... Infowars ...
now takes the absurd position that the
court-ordered protective order circumvents
the good cause requirements of
Practice Book &sect; 13-5, did not need to be
complied with, and should not be enforced
by the court. This argument is frightening.
Given the cavalier actions and wilful misconduct
of Infowars in filing protected deposition
information during the actual deposition,
this court has grave concerns that
their actions, in the future, will have a
chilling effect on the testimony of witnesses
who would be rightfully concerned
that their confidential information, including
their psychiatric and medical histories,
would be made available to the public. The
court will address sanctions at a future
hearing."<fnr17>

<P20>On July 6, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a
motion to sanction the Jones defendants
for failing to produce certain accounting
documents. The plaintiffs asserted in relevant
part that, (1) in connection with a
noticed deposition of Melinda Flores, Free
Speech System, LLC's accounting manager,
Flores was directed to produce documents,
including (a) Free Speech System,
LLC's trial balances from 2012 to 2019,
and (b) "`[a]ny and
<SPage 502>
all subsidiary ledgers
for each account listed in the [t]rial
balances produced,'"<fnr18> (2) the court ordered
the requested records to be produced
by the close of business on May 14,
2021,<fnr19> (3) on May 14, 2021, the Jones
<Page 957>
defendants produced documents that they
described to be trial balances "incorporating
the [s]ubsidiary [l]edgers," (4) notwithstanding
the Jones defendants' representation,
they failed to produce any subsidiary
ledgers, and (5) Flores testified during her
deposition that (a) she assisted in assembling
the documents produced on May 14,
2021, (b) Free Speech Systems, LLC,
maintained subsidiary ledger information
that was accessible, and (c) the documents
produced did not contain subsidiary ledgers.
(Emphasis omitted.) On July 27, 2021,
the Jones defendants filed an objection,
arguing in relevant part that Free Speech
Systems, LLC, did not possess or maintain
subsidiary ledgers. In support of their objection,
the Jones defendants submitted a
personal affidavit of Robert Roe (Roe affidavit),
a certified public accountant and a
certified forensic accountant, who averred
<SPage 503>
that Free Speech Systems, LLC, did
not maintain or utilize subsidiary ledgers.
On August 3, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a
reply brief.

<P20>On August 6, 2021, the court issued an
order stating in relevant part: "The subsidiary
ledger information ... was easily accessible
to Flores.... Despite the court
orders, and although the information exists,
is maintained by [Free Speech Systems,
LLC], and could have been produced
by Flores as was required by the court
orders, the documents were not produced.
The court rejects [Roe's] statement ...
that [Free Speech Systems, LLC] does not
`maintain or utilize' subsidiary ledgers as
not credible in light of the circumstances.
There is no excuse for the [Jones] defendants'
disregard of not only their discovery
obligations, but the ... court orders. The
court finds that the failure to comply with
the production request has prejudiced the
plaintiffs [in] their ability to both prosecute
their claims and conduct further depositions
in a meaningful manner." The
court further ordered (1) Flores' deposition
to resume, with Flores directed to
produce the subsidiary ledger information,
and (2) that sanctions would be addressed
at a future hearing. During subsequent
hearings before the court, the plaintiffs'
counsel represented that, on August 24,
2021, the Jones defendants produced alleged
subsidiary ledgers; however, the
plaintiffs' counsel further represented that
"it is not clear whether [the documents
produced were], in fact, subsidiary ledgers
...."

<P20>On August 24, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a
motion to sanction the Jones defendants
for violating the court's discovery orders
requiring them to produce, inter alia, the
Google Analytics data. The plaintiffs refuted
the Jones defendants' contention in
their June 28, 2021 notice of compliance
that Free Speech Systems, LLC, did not
possess, control, or have custody of the
Google Analytics data in a manner that
could be exported,
<SPage 504>
asserting that such
"representations were inaccurate and misleading."
On September 14, 2021, the
Jones defendants filed an objection, arguing,
inter alia, that (1) on June 17, 2019, via
email, they had produced the Google Analytics
data requested by the plaintiffs, and
(2) the "sandbox mechanism" previously
suggested by them would allow the plaintiffs
to access all of the "raw data." On
September 23, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a
reply brief, and on September 25, 2021,
with leave of the court, the Jones defendants
filed a surreply brief.

<P20>On September 30, 2021 the court issued
an order stating in relevant part: "There is
no dispute here that the Jones defendants
failed to follow the rules [of practice] as
they relate to discovery.... The purported
June 17, 2019 email transmission of zip
files ... containing Google Analytics reports
that the plaintiffs' counsel indicates
was never received was not sent to [certain
other defendants] nor did the purported
transmission otherwise comply with the
rules of practice. As such, it is not necessary
<Page 958>
for the court to resolve the issue of
whether the purported transmission was
actually sent, as it cannot be considered
proper compliance under our rules. In
short, after protracted objections and arguments
by the Jones defendants over
whether they had the ability to produce
ANY Google Analytics data, to date they
have still failed to comply.... In light of
this continued failure to meet their discovery
obligations in violation of the court's
order, to the prejudice of the plaintiffs, the
court will address the appropriate sanctions
at the next status conference." Subsequently,
by way of a notice of compliance
dated October 8, 2021, the Jones defendants
represented that they had provided
supplemental responses to the plaintiffs'
discovery requests.

<P20>On September 9, 2021, the plaintiffs
moved to sanction the Jones defendants
for producing "manufactured" documents
in discovery. The plaintiffs contended that
the trial balances that had been produced
<SPage 505>
were not the originals but, rather, constituted
altered trial balances that Roe had
manipulated prior to production. On October
7, 2021, the Jones defendants filed an
objection. On October 18, 2021, the plaintiffs
filed a reply brief, and on October 20,
2021, with leave of the court, the Jones
defendants filed a surreply brief.

<P20>On November 15, 2021, after hearing
argument from the parties over the course
of three days between October 20 and
November 15, 2021, the court issued an
oral decision defaulting the Jones defendants
as a sanction for violating (1) the
protective order and (2) its discovery orders.<fnr20>
With regard to the protective order,
the court found in relevant part that (1)
the Jones defendants acknowledged that
the motion to depose Clinton contained
information obtained from a deposition
that was designated as "Highly Confidential-Attorneys
Eyes Only" pursuant to the
protective order, (2) the Jones defendants
argued that the protective order did not
preclude them from publishing such confidential
information so long as they did not
identify the witness from whom the information
was obtained, which position "did
nothing but reinforce the court's August 5,
2021 order and findings that the [Jones
defendants'] cavalier actions constituted
wilful misconduct and violated the court's
clear and unambiguous protective order,"<fnr21>
and (3) there was a "transparent attempt
to cloud the issues" by counsel who had
filed the motion to depose Clinton, Pattis,
as well as one of the Jones defendants'
former
<SPage 506>
counsel, Attorney Jay Marshall
Wolman, stemming from inconsistent representations
as to whether Infowars, LLC,
was one of the movants of the motion to
depose Clinton.<fnr22>

<P20>With respect to the subsidiary ledgers,
the court summarized its findings in its
<Page 959>
August 6, 2021 order regarding the subsidiary
ledgers and commented that "it is still
unclear as to what documents have been
produced." The court then determined that
sanctions were "appropriate in light of the
[Jones] defendants' failure to fully and
fairly comply with the plaintiffs' discovery
request and the court's orders...."

<P20>Regarding the trial balances, the court
determined that the trial balances produced
by the Jones defendants did not
comply with its discovery orders. The
court stated that (1) Flores testified at her
deposition that she had generated the trial
balances, which she believed had been produced
to the plaintiffs, but (2) Roe later
altered those trial balances before they
had been provided to the plaintiffs. The
court rejected an argument asserted by
the Jones defendants that Flores had "provided
flawed information to the [Jones]
defendants that the [Jones] defendants,
through Roe, had to correct." The court
further stated: "The Jones defendants argue
that Roe combined some accounts that
were not used consistently and consolidated
some general accounts because various
transactions all involved the same account
and those records created by [Roe] were
the records that were produced. But these
records that removed accounts and consolidated
accounts altered
<SPage 507>
the information
in the reports that [Flores] had produced,
and they contain trial balances that did not
balance. These sanitized, inaccurate records
created by Roe were simply not responsive
to the plaintiffs' request or to the
court's order."

<P20>The court next addressed the Google
Analytics data requested by the plaintiffs,
stating: "With respect to analytics, including
Google Analytics ... the [Jones] defendants
on May 7, 2019, represented that
they had provided all the analytics that
they had. They stated with respect to Google
Analytics that they had access to Google
Analytics reports but did not regularly
use them.... The [Jones] defendants also
claim that, on June 17, 2019, they informally
emailed zip files containing Google Analytics
reports to the plaintiffs, but not [to]
the codefendants, an email the plaintiffs
state they did not receive and that the
court found would not have been in compliance
with our rules of practice. On June
28, 2021, the Jones defendants filed a notice
of compliance stating that complete,
final supplemental compliance was made
by ... [Jones] and Free Speech Systems,
LLC, and that Infowars, LLC, Infowars
Health, LLC, and Prison Planet [TV],
LLC, quote: `Had previously produced all
documents required to be produced,' ...
representing that with respect to the Google
Analytics documents, Free Speech Systems,
LLC, could not export the dataset
and that the only way they could comply
was through the sandbox approach. Then
on [October] 8, 2021,<fnr23> the Jones defendants
for the first time formally produced
Excel spreadsheets limited to Google Analytics
apparently for [Infowars.com] and
not for any of the other websites such as
Prison Planet TV
<SPage 508>
or Infowars Health."
(Footnote added.) The court also found
that (1) the Jones defendants had failed to
produce analytics data for other platforms,
such as Alexa and Criteo, and (2) the
Jones defendants' production of certain social
media analytics data "has ... been
insubstantial and ... has fallen far short
both procedurally and substantively
...."<fnr24> As the court summarized, "[t]he
<Page 960>
court finds that the Jones defendants have
withheld analytics and information that is
critical to the plaintiffs' ability to conduct
meaningful discovery and to prosecute
their claims. This callous disregard of their
obligations to fully and fairly comply with
discovery and court orders on its own merits
a default against the Jones defendants."

<P20>The court then stated: "Neither the
court nor the parties can expect perfection
when it comes to the discovery process.
What is required, however, and what all
parties are entitled to, is fundamental fairness
that the other side produces that
information which is within [its] knowledge,
possession and power, and that the
other side meet[s] its continuing duty to
disclose additional or new material and
amend prior compliance when it is incorrect.

<P20>"Here, the Jones defendants were not
just careless. Their failure to produce critical
documents, their disregard for the discovery
process and procedure and for
court orders is a pattern of obstructive
conduct that interferes with the ability of
the plaintiffs to conduct meaningful discovery
and prevents the plaintiffs from properly
prosecuting their claims.
<SPage 509>

<P20>"The court held off on scheduling this
sanctions hearing in the hopes that many
of these problems would be corrected and
that the Jones defendants would ultimately
comply with their discovery obligations
and numerous court orders, and they have
not.

<P20>"In addressing the sanctions that should
enter here, the court is not punishing the
[Jones] defendants. The court also recognizes
that a sanction of default is one of
last resort. This court previously sanctioned
the [Jones] defendants not by entering
a default, but by a lesser sanction, the
preclusion of the [Jones] defendants' special
motions to dismiss. At this point, entering
other lesser sanctions such as monetary
sanctions, the preclusion of evidence,
or the establishment of facts is inadequate
given the scope and extent of the discovery
material that the [Jones] defendants have
failed to produce.

<P20>"As pointed out by the plaintiffs, they
are attempting to conduct discovery on
what the [Jones] defendants publish and
the [Jones] defendants' revenue. And the
failure of the [Jones] defendants to produce
the analytics impacts the ability of
the plaintiffs to address what is published,
and the [Jones] defendants' failure to produce
the financial records such as subledgers
and trial balances affects the ability of
the plaintiffs to address the [Jones] defendants'
revenue. The prejudice suffered by
the plaintiffs, who had the right to conduct
appropriate, meaningful discovery so they
could prosecute their claims, again was
caused by the Jones defendants' wilful
noncompliance, that is, the Jones defendants'
failure to produce critical material
information that the plaintiff[s] needed to
prove their claims.

<P20>"For these reasons, the court is entering
a default against the [Jones] defendants
.... The case will proceed as a hearing in
damages as to the [Jones] defendants. The
court notes [that] ... Jones is [the] sole
controlling authority of all the [Jones] defendants,
and
<SPage 510>
that the [Jones] defendants
filed motions and signed off on their
discovery issues jointly. And all the [Jones]
defendants have failed to fully and fairly
comply with their discovery obligations."

<P20>On appeal, the defendants assert
that (1) the court incorrectly (a) determined
that they had violated the protective
<Page 961>
order in filing the motion to depose Clinton
or, in the alternative, (b) attributed the
violation of the protective order to them
rather than to their counsel,<fnr25> (2) the court
incorrectly determined that their noncompliance
with its discovery orders was wilful,
and (3) the court's sanction order defaulting
them was disproportionate.<fnr26>
<Page 962>
These contentions are unavailing.
<SPage 511>

<P20>"A trial court's power to sanction
a litigant or counsel stems from two
different sources of authority, its inherent
powers and the rules of practice.... [T]his
inherent authority permits sanctions for
dilatory, bad faith and harassing litigation
conduct...." (Citations omitted; internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Lafferty</EM> v.
<EM>Jones,</EM> supra, 336 Conn. at 373, 246 A.3d
429.

<P20>"Additionally, under Practice Book [Rev.
to 2021] &sect; 13-14,<fnr27> a court may sanction a
party for noncompliance with the court's
discovery orders. Among the permissible
sanctions is foreclosing judgment on the
merits
<SPage 512>
for a party, such as by rendering
a default judgment against a defendant
...." (Footnote added.) Id.

<P20>We consider three factors in determining
whether "a trial court properly
exercises its discretion in imposing a sanction
for a violation of a court order...."
<EM>Ridgaway</EM> v. <EM>Mount Vernon Fire Ins. Co.,</EM>

also <EM>Millbrook Owners Assn., Inc.</EM> v. <EM>Hamilton
Standard,</EM> 257 Conn. 1, 17-18, 776
A.2d 1115 (2001). "First, the order to be
complied with must be reasonably clear. In
this connection, however, we also state
that even an order that does not meet this
standard may form the basis of a sanction
if the record establishes that, notwithstanding
the lack of such clarity, the party
sanctioned in fact understood the trial
court's intended meaning. This requirement
poses a legal question that we will
review de novo. Second, the record must
establish that the order was in fact violated.
This requirement poses a question of
fact that we will review using a clearly
erroneous standard of review.<fnr28> Third, the
sanction imposed must be proportional to
the violation. This requirement poses a
<SPage 513>
question of the discretion of the trial
court that we will review for abuse of that
discretion." (Footnote added; internal quotation

supra, 336 Conn. at 373-74, 246 A.3d 429.

<CN>A

<P20>The defendants contend that the court
improperly (1) determined that they had
violated the protective order in filing the
motion to depose Clinton or, in the alternative,
(2) attributed the violation of the protective
order to them, as opposed to their
counsel. We are not persuaded.

<P20>As to the court's determination
that the filing of the motion to depose
<Page 963>
Clinton violated the protective order, the
defendants maintain that, in the motion,
they "represented that at a deposition a
witness was instructed by counsel not to
answer questions about choice of counsel
or who was financing the litigation. The
name and gender of the deponent were
not mentioned; the deposition was characterized,
not quoted.... The de minimis
recitation of facts in the motion ... did
not violate a court order...." (Citations
omitted; footnote omitted.) As the court
correctly determined, however, the clear
and unambiguous language of the protective
order limited access to depositions, or
portions thereof, designated as "Highly
Confidential-Attorneys Eyes Only." The
defendants acknowledge that the motion to
depose Clinton contained information
drawn from the transcript of one of the
plaintiffs' depositions, which, as the court
found, was designated as "Highly Confidential-Attorneys
Eyes Only" pursuant to
the protective order. Thus, in filing the
motion to depose Clinton and making the
confidential information set forth therein
available to the public, the defendants
plainly violated the protective order.
<SPage 514>

<P20>Moreover, the defendants' position on
appeal is further undermined by the fact
that, during argument preceding the
court's sanctions order, one of the defendants'
former counsel, Wolman, conceded
that the defendants' actions violated the
protective order. The following colloquy
occurred between the court and Wolman:

<P20>"[Wolman]: ... We do take the [protective]
order very seriously and have endeavored
to abide it. There was during a
deposition this motion [to depose Clinton]
filed. And at the end of the day it comes
down to simply one sentence. That the
witness claims not to know how her legal
fees were being paid. That's the only information
that I can see in that motion that
gives rise to the court's order. And you
know, it was erroneously believed that that
was not subject to the [protective] order.
The witness herself was not identified.
<EM>And while it may be a technical violation,</EM>
and it was not realized to be so at the
time&mdash;

<P20>"The Court: So, do you admit now that it
was a violation, whether it's a technical
violation or not?

<P20>"[Wolman]: <EM>I would say it probably fits
within the language of what is protected.</EM>
We had concerns as to whether or not it
truly was protected. The court has
weighed in." (Emphasis added.)

<P20>Accordingly, we reject the defendants'
assertion that the court incorrectly determined
that they violated the protective
order in filing the motion to depose Clinton.

<P20>The defendants, in the alternative,
contend that the court improperly ascribed
the violation of the protective order to
them rather than to their counsel. The
defendants posit that, rather than referring
counsel for disciplinary action, the
court "attributed counsel's alleged failure
to [the defendants], justifying a default on
conduct over which the defendants themselves
had no control, and about which, the
record reflects, they knew
<SPage 515>
nothing." The
defendants fail to cite any portion of the
record supporting their assertion that they
were unaware of counsel's actions. Without
any such evidence, we cannot countenance
the defendants' reasoning that they were
absolved of any discipline stemming from
counsel's conduct. See <EM>MacCalla</EM> v. <EM>American
Medical Response of Connecticut,
Inc.,</EM> 188 Conn. App. 228, 240, 204 A.3d 753
(2019) ("Although in some circumstances it
may be unduly harsh to impute counsel's
transgressions to his client, `our adversarial
system [also] requires that the client be
responsible for acts of the attorney-agent
whom [he] has freely chosen....' <EM>Thode</EM>
v. <EM>Thode,</EM> 190 Conn. 694, 698, 462 A.2d 4

755, 773 n.6, 164 A.3d 702 (`[a]n attorney is

imputed to the client' ...), cert. denied,
327 Conn. 906, 170 A.3d 2 (2017)."); see
also <EM>MacCalla</EM> v. <EM>American Medical Response
of Connecticut, Inc.,</EM> supra, at 239-40,
204 A.3d 753 (concluding that court did
not abuse its discretion in dismissing
claims of certain plaintiffs on basis of counsel's
actions); cf. <EM>Herrick</EM> v. <EM>Monkey Farm
Cafe, LLC,</EM> 163 Conn. App. 45, 52-53, 134
A.3d 643 (2016) (reversing trial court's
judgment of nonsuit rendered on basis of
counsel's actions).

<CN>B

<P20>The defendants next claim that the court
erred in finding that they wilfully violated
its discovery orders. As to the discovery
orders in general, the defendants maintain
that "the failure to provide answers was
not an example of wilful misconduct. Rather,
it was the result of a shocking degree
of disorganization. The plaintiffs persuaded
the trial judge that the plaintiffs' expectations
of how the defendants should operate
their business and keep records was
the standard the defendants must meet.
The default prevented a jury from learning
the truth about the defendants' corporate
organization&mdash;it is a haphazard warren of
people drawn
<SPage 516>
together by ... Jones'
charisma and generosity, but almost altogether
devoid of institutional structure or
normal corporate governance." We are unpersuaded.

<P20>Whether a party wilfully violates
a court order "is a factual question
committed to the sound discretion of the
trial court." (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) <EM>Lafferty</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM> supra, 222
Conn. App. at 867, 307 A.3d 923. The
court's finding that the defendants' noncompliance
with its discovery orders was
wilful was supported by its subordinate
findings that (1) the subsidiary ledgers
requested by the plaintiffs were "easily
accessible" and "available" to Flores, (2)
Flores generated the trial balances sought
by the plaintiffs, but those trial balances
later were altered by Roe prior to production
to the plaintiffs, and (3) the defendants
withheld analytics materials and
exhibited a "callous disregard of their obligations
to fully and fairly comply with
discovery...." Rather than adequately
contesting the factual underpinnings of
these findings, the defendants propound
the argument that their failure to comply
with the court's discovery orders
stemmed from their purported institutional
disorganization. The defendants fail to
cite to any portion of the record that supports
this assertion. Moreover, the defendants'
argument is belied by their own
statement in their principal appellate brief
that, notwithstanding their purported disorganized
corporate structure, they "tendered
tens of thousands of documents, sat
for scores of depositions, provided answers
to requests to admit, and otherwise
made efforts to comply with discovery."
Thus, the defendants' claim regarding the
wilfulness of their noncompliance with the
court's discovery orders in general is untenable.

<P20>The defendants also assert that
the court incorrectly determined that they
had wilfully violated its discovery orders
specifically concerning the Google Analytics
data. The defendants maintain that
they (1) made "limited and sporadic use of
Google Analytics data," (2)
<SPage 517>
"did not
keep [any] reports, did not generally or
systematically rely on them, and consulted
Google Analytics only haphazardly," and
(3) did not possess the Google Analytics
data, but, rather, "access[ed] the information
on Google servers," such that they did
not wilfully fail to comply with the court's
orders regarding the Google Analytics
data. We reject this assertion. The frequency
of the defendants' use and reliance
<Page 965>
on the Google Analytics data has no bearing
on their obligation to abide by the
court's discovery orders requiring them to
provide the data to the plaintiffs. Further,
whether the defendants were in possession
of the Google Analytics data is immaterial
because the plaintiffs' production request
sought analytics that the defendants
"own[ed] <EM>and/or control</EM>[<EM>led</EM>]." (Emphasis
added.) See Practice Book &sect; 13-9 (a)<fnr29>
("[i]n any civil action, in any probate appeal,
or in any administrative appeal where
the judicial authority finds it reasonably
probable that evidence outside the record
will be required, any party may serve ...
upon any other party a request to afford
the party submitting the request the opportunity
to inspect, copy, photograph or
otherwise reproduce designated documents
or to inspect and copy, test or sample any
tangible things <EM>in the possession, custody
or control</EM> of the party upon whom the
request is served" (emphasis added)). As
the court found, the defendants (1) had
access to the Google Analytics data and (2)
produced some Google Analytics data to
the plaintiffs, albeit not in full and fair
compliance with the court's discovery orders.
Accordingly, we conclude that the
court properly found that the defendants
wilfully violated the court's discovery orders
as to the Google Analytics data.

<CN>C

<P20>The defendants next claim that
the court's order defaulting them as a
sanction for their violations of its
<SPage 518>
discovery orders and the protective order
was disproportionate. The defendants
maintain that, although they "resisted discovery
by every lawful means possible in
lengthy proceedings ... [t]heir compliance
was substantial," and they did not "[fail] to
answer the complaint, [fail] to respond to
discovery or otherwise [fail] to participate
in the proceedings."<fnr30> We conclude that the
court did not abuse its discretion in defaulting
the defendants.

<P20>As we set forth previously in
this opinion, whether the court's sanction
defaulting the defendants was proportional
to their violations of the court's orders
"poses a question of the discretion of the
trial court that we will review for abuse of
that discretion." (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) <EM>Lafferty</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM> supra, 336
Conn. at 374, 246 A.3d 429. "As with any
discretionary action of the trial court, appellate
review requires every reasonable
presumption in favor of the action, and the
ultimate issue for us is whether the trial
court could have reasonably concluded as
it did.... In reviewing a claim that the
court has abused this discretion, great
<Page 966>
weight is due to the action of the trial
court and every reasonable presumption
should be given in favor of its correctness
<SPage 519>
.... The determinative question for an
appellate court is not whether it would
have imposed a similar sanction but
whether the trial court could reasonably
conclude as it did given the facts presented....
Under an abuse of discretion standard,
a court's decision must be legally
sound and [the court] must [have] honest[ly]
attempt[ed] ... to do what is right
and equitable under the circumstances of
the law, without the dictates of whim or
caprice." (Citation omitted; internal quotation

cert. denied, 345 Conn. 963, 285 A.3d 390
(2022). With regard to discovery orders in
particular, "[n]ever will the case on appeal
look as it does to a [trial court] ... faced
with the need to impose reasonable bounds
and order on discovery.... Trial court
judges face great difficulties in controlling
discovery procedures which all too often
are abused by one side or the other and
this court should support the trial judges'
reasonable use of sanctions to control discovery."
(Citation omitted; internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Lafferty</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM> supra,
at 374, 246 A.3d 429.

<P20>"[I]n assessing proportionality,
a trial court must consider the totality of
the circumstances, including, most importantly,
the nature of the conduct itself....
[A] trial court's discretion should be exercised
mindful of the policy preference to
bring about a trial on the merits of a
dispute whenever possible and to secure
for the litigant his day in court.... Our
practice does not favor the termination of
proceedings without a determination of the
merits of the controversy where that can
be brought about with due regard to necessary
rules of procedure.... Therefore,
although dismissal of an action is not an
abuse of discretion where a party shows
deliberate, contumacious or unwarranted
disregard for the court's authority ... the
court should be reluctant to employ the
sanction of dismissal except as a last resort....
[T]he sanction of dismissal should
be
<SPage 520>
imposed only as a last resort, and
where it would be the only reasonable
remedy available to vindicate the legitimate
interests of the other party and the
court.... Like a dismissal, a default judgment
is also one of the more severe sanctions
that a court may impose...." (Citations

A.3d 926 (2021).

<P20>In determining whether the sanction
of default was proportional to the
defendants' violations of the court's orders,
"we are guided by the factors [our Supreme
Court] ... ha[s] employed when
reviewing the reasonableness of a trial
court's imposition of sanctions: (1) the
cause of the [party's] failure to [comply
with the orders], that is, whether it [was]
due to inability rather than the [wilfulness],
bad faith or fault of the [party] ...
(2) the degree of prejudice suffered by the
opposing party ... and (3) which of the
available sanctions would, under the particular
circumstances, be an appropriate
response to the disobedient party's conduct."
(Internal quotation marks omitted.)
<EM>Gianetti</EM> v. <EM>Neigher,</EM> supra, 214 Conn. App.
at 439, 280 A.3d 555.

<P20>Remaining mindful, as the trial
court recognized, that a default is a sanction
of last resort, we conclude that the
court's default order was a proportional
sanction under the circumstances presented.
As to the wilfulness factor, the court
found that the defendants' failure to produce
"critical material information" to the
plaintiffs, as well as the defendants' "cavalier
actions" in filing the motion to depose
Clinton, constituted wilful noncompliance
and misconduct. The court further found
<Page 967>
that "the Jones defendants were not just
careless. Their failure to produce critical
documents, their disregard for the discovery
process and procedure and for court
<SPage 521>
orders is a pattern of obstructive conduct
...."<fnr31> Thus, this factor militates in
favor of the court's default order.

<P20>With regard to the prejudice factor,
the court found that the purpose of the
plaintiffs' discovery requests was to determine
(1) what the defendants published
and (2) the defendants' revenue, which
purpose was thwarted by the defendants'
failure to produce the analytics data, the
subsidiary ledgers, and the trial balances
requested by the plaintiffs. The court further
found that the defendants' conduct
"interfere[d] with the ability of the plaintiffs
to conduct meaningful discovery and
prevent[ed] the plaintiffs from properly
prosecuting their claims." See <EM>Krahel</EM> v.
<EM>Czoch,</EM> 186 Conn. App. 22, 35-36, 198 A.3d
103 (discussing importance of unproduced
discovery and its effect as to plaintiff's
case when examining prejudice), cert. denied,
330 Conn. 958, 198 A.3d 584 (2018);
see also <EM>Lafferty</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM> supra, 336
Conn. at 378, 246 A.3d 429 (citing <EM>Krahel</EM>
in analyzing prejudice factor).

<P20>Additionally, with regard to the
protective order, the court stated in its
August 5, 2021 order addressing the filing
of the motion to depose Clinton that (1)
the defendants, in filing the motion to depose
Clinton, made information designated
as "Highly Confidential-Attorneys Eyes
Only" under the protective order available
on the Internet, (2) the defendants took no
corrective action thereafter, and (3) it had
"grave concerns" that there would be "a
chilling effect on the testimony of witnesses
who would be rightfully concerned
that their confidential information, including
their psychiatric and medical histories,
would be made available to the public."
The court iterated these concerns during
argument preceding its sanction order,
stating in relevant
<SPage 522>
part: "So, I do intend
to impose sanctions [for the violation
of the protective order].... I think the
[defendants'] behavior really is unconscionable....
And I am concerned about a
chilling effect on the testimony of other
witnesses." In light of these concerns, this
factor weighs in favor of the court's default
order.

<P20>Finally, the court determined that
imposing a lesser sanction would be "inadequate
...." In 2019, following the defendants'
noncompliance with discovery vis-&agrave;-vis
the special motions to dismiss and
Jones' comments during his June 14, 2019
radio broadcast, the court sanctioned the
defendants by precluding them from pursuing
the special motions to dismiss; however,
the court cautioned that it would
consider defaulting them in the future if
"they, from th[at] point forward, continue[d]
with their behavior with respect to
discovery." Later, the court also warned
the defendants that they risked being defaulted
if they failed to comply with its
June 2, 2021 order directing the production
of complete, final supplemental compliance.
See <EM>Ridgaway</EM> v. <EM>Mount Vernon
Fire Ins. Co.,</EM> supra, 328 Conn. at 74, 176
A.3d 1167 ("[i]n instances in which our
appellate courts have upheld the sanction
of a nonsuit, a significant factor has been
that the trial court put the plaintiff on
notice that noncompliance would result in
a nonsuit"). Nevertheless, as the court
found, the defendants continued to engage
in "a pattern of obstructive conduct" in
"callous[ly]" disregarding their discovery
obligations. This conduct was not isolated;
rather, as the various orders entered by
the court demonstrate, notwithstanding
being given ample opportunities to comply,
<Page 968>
the defendants repeatedly failed to produce
adequate, responsive materials. The
court reasonably determined that a lesser
sanction would not suffice under such circumstances.
See <EM>Gutierrez</EM> v. <EM>Mosor,</EM> supra,
206 Conn. App. at 829, 261 A.3d 850
("[t]he appellate courts of this state consistently
have upheld nonsuits, defaults or
other sanctions imposed for discovery
<SPage 523>
violations where the noncomplying party
has exhibited a pattern of violations or
discovery abuse demonstrating a disregard
for the court's authority").

<P20>Moreover, in the midst of the defendants'
ongoing discovery noncompliance,
the defendants filed the motion to depose
Clinton, which contained information designated
as "Highly Confidential-Attorneys
Eyes Only" subject to the protective order.
As the court determined, the defendants,
in a "cavalier" fashion, violated the protective
order, which they originally had proposed,
by releasing the confidential information
to the public, thereby creating a
palpable risk of a "chilling effect" on the
testimony of witnesses in the future.
Against this backdrop, we cannot discern
an abuse of discretion by the court in
defaulting the defendants as a sanction.
See <EM>Gutierrez</EM> v. <EM>Mosor,</EM> supra, 206 Conn.
App. at 827, 261 A.3d 850 ("dismissal of an
action is not an abuse of discretion where a
party shows deliberate, contumacious or
unwarranted disregard for the court's authority"
(emphasis omitted; internal quotation
marks omitted)).

<P20>In sum, we conclude that the court properly
exercised its discretion in defaulting
the defendants as a sanction for their violations
of its discovery orders and the protective
order.

<CN>II

<P20>The defendants next claim that the trial
court improperly construed the effect of
the defendants' default to relieve the plaintiffs
of the burden to establish the extent
of their damages. This claim warrants little
discussion.

<P20>Initially, we observe that the defendants
assert that the court "never made
a principled and intelligible ruling about
causation in this case" but, rather, treated
causation as having been established following
the
<SPage 524>
defendants' default. The defendants
do not brief any substantive
claims as to any particular rulings of the
court<fnr32> but, rather, take issue with the
court's rulings as a whole insofar as the
court purportedly "eviscerated the concept
of causation and relieved the plaintiffs of
any responsibility to prove, or even to
attempt to prove, a linkage to the various
and diffuse harms they suffered and the
conduct of the [defendants]."<fnr33> We exercise
<SPage 525>
plenary review over this claim, which
<Page 969>
presents a question of law. See <EM>Williams</EM> v.
<EM>Mansfield,</EM> 215 Conn. App. 1, 10, 281 A.3d
1263 (2022) ("[w]hen ... a court's decision
is challenged on the basis of a question of
law, our review is plenary").

<P20>It is axiomatic that "[a] default
admits the material facts that constitute a
cause of action ... and entry of default,
when appropriately made, conclusively determines
the liability of a defendant.... If
the allegations of the plaintiff's complaint
are sufficient on their face to make out a
valid claim for the relief requested, the
plaintiff, on the entry of a default against
the defendant, need not offer evidence to
support those allegations.... Therefore,
the only issue ... following a default is the
determination of damages.... A plaintiff
ordinarily is entitled to at least nominal
damages following an entry of default
against a defendant in a legal action....

<P20>"In an action at law, the rule is
that the entry of a default operates as a
confession by the defaulted defendant of
the truth of the material facts alleged in
the complaint which are essential to entitle
the plaintiff to some of the relief prayed. It
is not the equivalent of an admission of all
of the facts pleaded. The limit of its effect
is to preclude the defaulted defendant
from making any further defense and to
permit the entry of a judgment against
him on the theory that he has admitted
such of the facts alleged in the complaint
as are essential to such a judgment. It
does not follow that the plaintiff is entitled
to a judgment for the full amount of the
relief claimed. The plaintiff must still
prove how much of the judgment prayed
for in the complaint he is entitled to receive."<fnr34>

99 Conn. App. 719, 725-26, 916 A.2d
834 (2007).

<P20>As these legal principles elucidate, after
the court had defaulted the defendants, the
plaintiffs were not required to demonstrate
that the defendants' conduct caused their
harm. Instead, following the defendants'
default, the only burden carried by the
plaintiffs was to prove the amount of their
damages. See <EM>Murray</EM> v. <EM>Taylor,</EM> 65 Conn.
App. 300, 335, 782 A.2d 702 (This court, in
reversing the trial court's grant of the
defaulted defendant's motion to set aside
the verdict following the hearing in damages,
explained that "[t]he [trial] court determined
that there was no evidence from
which the jury reasonably could have
found that the plaintiff's damages were
proximately caused by the conduct alleged
and ruled against the plaintiff on that basis.
Yet, in an action at law, as here, the
liability of a defaulted defendant is established
and the plaintiff's burden at a hearing
in damages is limited to proving that
the amount of damages claimed is derived
from the injuries suffered and is properly
supported by the evidence.... We, therefore,
cannot agree with the court's conclusion
that the plaintiff's claim must fail
because he did not provide evidence that
[the defaulted defendant's] negligent conduct
proximately caused his injuries...."

<SPage 527>
Conn. 928, 783 A.2d 1029 (2001).<fnr35> Accordingly,
the defendants' claim fails.

<CN>III

<P20>The defendants also claim that the
trial court improperly restricted the scope
of Jones' testimony at the hearing in damages.
We conclude that the defendants
have abandoned this claim by failing to
brief it adequately.

<P20>The following additional procedural history
is relevant. On September 6, 2022, the
court granted motions in limine filed by
the plaintiffs seeking to preclude evidence
or argument at the hearing in damages
concerning, inter alia, (1) the defendants'
"maximum total amount of Sandy Hook
coverage or percentage or proportion of
Sandy Hook coverage" and (2) the court's
ruling defaulting the defendants. Additionally,
on September 13, 2022, the court
granted a motion for sanctions filed by the
plaintiffs on the basis of additional discovery
misconduct by the defendants. The
court sanctioned the defendants by prohibiting
them from presenting evidence or
argument "that they did not profit from
their Sandy Hook coverage."

<P20>On September 22, 2022, during the hearing
in damages, the plaintiffs called Jones
as a witness. Outside of the jury's presence,
the court canvassed Jones with regard
to the various topics about which (1)
counsel were prohibited from asking him
and (2) he was precluded from testifying.
Jones indicated that he understood which
topics his testimony could not address.
During the course of Jones' direct examination,
the
<SPage 528>
court and counsel engaged in
multiple sidebars, and the jury was excused
several times, in order to address
whether certain questions asked by the
plaintiffs' counsel and testimony by Jones
were proper in light of the court's orders.
The next day, the defendants' counsel informed
the court that, for "strategic" reasons,
the defendants were forfeiting the
right to cross-examine Jones, intending instead
<Page 971>
to call him as a witness during their
case-in-chief. On October 5, 2022, outside
of the jury's presence, the defendants'
counsel notified the court that Jones had
decided not to testify during the defendants'
case-in-chief, explaining that Jones
was "boycotting [the] proceedings because
he [felt] that [he was] on the horns of a
trilemma. If he testifie[d] in accord with
the court's orders [restricting his testimony],
[he would] be committing perjury; if
he violate[d] the court orders, [it would be]
criminal contempt; if he [took] the fifth
[amendment to the United States constitution],
he [would get an] adverse inference."

<P20>The defendants claim on appeal that the
court committed error in restricting the
scope of Jones' testimony. The majority of
the defendants' briefing of this claim focuses
on reciting and commenting on the relevant
procedural history, iterating the "trilemma"
that Jones purportedly faced, and
detailing how Jones would have testified
but for the court's orders limiting his testimony.
The defendants, however, provide
no substantive legal analysis examining the
propriety of the court's orders imposing
limits on Jones' testimony, such as the
court's September 13, 2022 order sanctioning
the defendants for additional discovery
violations. Accordingly, we conclude that
the defendants have abandoned this claim
as a result of their failure to adequately
brief it. See <EM>Lafferty</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM> supra, 336
Conn. at 375 n.30, 246 A.3d 429.

<CN>IV

<P20>The defendants next claim that the trial
court improperly denied their motion for a
remittitur. We disagree.
<SPage 529>

<P20>The following additional procedural
history is relevant to our resolution of this
claim. The evidentiary portion of the hearing
in damages transpired over the course
of several weeks, commencing on September
13, 2022, and concluding on October 5,
2022. The following witnesses testified during
the plaintiffs' case-in-chief: (1) the
plaintiffs; (2) Alissa Parker, a spouse of
one of the plaintiffs; (3) Brittany Paz, a
Connecticut attorney who served as a corporate
representative of Free Speech Systems,
LLC; (4) Clinton Watts, an expert in
the field of "identifying analytics and analysis
around social media, the Internet, and
how it influences people's behavior"; and
(5) Jones. The court admitted in full numerous
exhibits offered by the plaintiffs,
including video clips of Jones' broadcasts.
The defendants rested without calling any
witnesses or offering any exhibits, except
for one exhibit that was marked for identification
only.

<P20>In its verdict, the jury awarded the
plaintiffs a total of $965,000,000 in compensatory
damages, which was split into two
categories for each plaintiff: (1) "defamation/slander"
damages, past and future;
and (2) emotional distress damages, past
and future. The jury did not divide the
$965,000,000 amount evenly among the
plaintiffs; rather, other than two plaintiffs
who were each awarded $57,600,000, each
plaintiff was awarded a distinct amount of
compensatory damages.

<P20>In moving for a remittitur, the defendants
asserted that the jury's verdict was
"exorbitant, shock[ed] the sense of justice
and was influenced by partiality and prejudice."
The defendants argued that (1) the
plaintiffs failed to submit evidence to aid
the jury in calculating compensatory damages,
such as medical evidence or expert
testimony on the extent of their emotional
distress, such that the jury's verdict was
predicated on speculation and was motivated
by prejudice and passion, (2) the jury,
in essence, awarded the plaintiffs
<SPage 530>
punitive damages rather than compensatory
damages, and (3) the defendants'
right to due process was violated as a
result of the plaintiffs' failure to submit
evidence estimating their damages. The
<Page 972>
plaintiffs filed a memorandum of law in
opposition to the motion for a remittitur,
refuting the defendants' arguments.

<P20>In denying the defendants' motion for a
remittitur, the court stated: "The defendants
take the position, in a conclusory
manner unsupported by any evidence or
case law, that the verdict was `exorbitant'
and the result of `passion and prejudice.'
They argue&mdash;again, unsupported by any
law&mdash;that due process requires that the
plaintiffs are responsible for establishing
what they think would make them whole&mdash;
that is, that the plaintiffs should have been
required to offer evidence as to the
amount they sought in compensatory damages.
As the plaintiffs point out, the defendants
cite no transcript, exhibits, or case
law to even begin to carry their burden of
showing manifest injustice.<fnr36> Here, the
overwhelming evidence of the plaintiffs'
injuries and damages, in conjunction with
the court's instructions on the law, which
the jury is presumed to have followed,
clearly support[s] the [verdict] rendered
by the jury. The size of the [verdict], while
substantial, does not so shock the sense of
justice as to compel the conclusion that the
jury was influenced by partiality, prejudice,
mistake or corruption, but instead
falls within the necessarily uncertain limits
of just damages to be determined by the
jury. This jury discharged its obligations
conscientiously, dutifully, and according to
the court's instructions on the law to be
applied. This jury was a careful jury whose
behavior was beyond reproach; [its] attention
to the evidence and instructions from
the
<SPage 531>
court is evident from the specific
questions [it] asked regarding both the
charge and the evidence.<fnr37> In reviewing
the evidence in a light most favorable to
sustaining the [verdict], the court finds
that the evidence of the devastating harm
caused to the plaintiffs through the defendants'
continued use of their business platform[s]
to spread lies to a massive audience
clearly supports the [verdict], and
that the [verdict was] within the limits of a
fair and just award of damages." (Footnotes
added; footnotes omitted.)

<P20>Before addressing the defendants' claim,
we set forth the following applicable legal
principles and standard of review. General
Statutes &sect; 52-216a provides in relevant
part: "If the court at the conclusion of the
trial concludes that the verdict is excessive
as a matter of law, it shall order a remittitur
and, upon failure of the party so ordered
to remit the amount ordered by the
court, it shall set aside the verdict and
order a new trial...."

<P20>"[I]n determining whether to
order remittitur, the trial court is required
to review the evidence in the light most
favorable to sustaining the verdict....
Upon completing that review, the court
should not interfere with the jury's determination
except when the verdict is plainly
excessive or exorbitant.... The ultimate
test [that] must be applied to the verdict
by the trial court is whether the jury's
award falls somewhere within the necessarily
uncertain limits of just damages or
whether the size of the verdict so shocks
the sense of justice as to compel the conclusion
that the jury [was] influenced by
partiality, prejudice, mistake or corruption
.... The court's broad power to order
a remittitur should be exercised only when
it is manifest that the jury [has awarded
damages that] are contrary to law, not
supported by proof, or contrary to the
court's
<SPage 532>
explicit and unchallenged instructions....
<Page 973>
Accordingly, we consistently
have held that a court should exercise
its authority to order a remittitur rarely&mdash;
only in the most exceptional of circumstances
... and [when] the court can articulate
very clear, definite and satisfactory
reasons ... for such interference." (Citation
omitted; internal quotation marks
omitted.) <EM>Ashmore</EM> v. <EM>Hartford Hospital,</EM>
331 Conn. 777, 782-83, 208 A.3d 256 (2019).
The inquiry into whether a damages award
shocks the sense of justice "is not intended
to detect the kind of shock that arises from
a moral outrage but, instead, refers to the
distress that may be felt when the requirement
of reasonableness has been abandoned
in a setting in which reason is a
necessary element of any legitimate outcome.
If the verdict cannot be explained
rationally, then the trial court may presume
that it is tainted by improper considerations."
<EM>Maldonado</EM> v. <EM>Flannery,</EM> 343
Conn. 150, 166-67, 272 A.3d 1089 (2022).

<P20>"[O]ur review of the trial
court's decision [to grant or deny remittitur]
requires careful balancing.... [T]he
decision whether to reduce a jury verdict
because it is excessive as a matter of law
... rests solely within the discretion of the
trial court.... [T]he same general principles
apply to a trial court's decision to
order a remittitur. [Consequently], the
proper standard of review ... is that of an
abuse of discretion.... [T]he ruling of the
trial court ... is entitled to great weight
and every reasonable presumption should
be given in favor of its correctness....
The chief rationale that has been articulated
in support of this deferential standard
of review is that the trial court, having
observed the trial and evaluated the testimony
firsthand, is better positioned than a
reviewing court to assess both the aptness
of the award and whether the jury may
have been motivated by improper sympathy,
<SPage 533>
partiality, or prejudice."<fnr38> (Citations
omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)
<EM>Ashmore</EM> v. <EM>Hartford Hospital,</EM> supra,
331 Conn. at 783, 208 A.3d 256.

<P20>"[A]lthough the trial court has
a broad legal discretion in this area, it is
not without its limits.... Litigants have a
constitutional right to have factual issues
resolved by the jury.... This right embraces
the determination of damages when
there is room for a reasonable difference
of opinion among fair-minded persons as to
the amount that should be awarded....
Furthermore, [t]he size of the verdict
alone does not determine whether it is
excessive.... Thus, [i]n ruling on the motion
for remittitur, the trial court [is]
obliged to view the evidence in the light
most favorable to the plaintiff in determining
whether the verdict returned [is] reasonably
supported thereby.... A conclusion
that the jury exercised merely poor
judgment is an insufficient basis for ordering
a remittitur.... A generous award of
noneconomic damages should be sustained
if it does not shock the sense of justice....
The fact that the jury returns a verdict in
excess of what the trial judge would have
awarded does not alone establish that the
verdict was excessive.... [T]he court
should not act as the seventh juror with
absolute veto power. Whether the court
would have reached a different [result] is
not in itself decisive.... The court's proper
function is to determine whether the
evidence, reviewed in a light most favorable
to the prevailing party, reasonably
supports the jury's verdict.... In determining
whether the court abused its discretion,
therefore, we must examine the
evidential basis of the verdict itself....
<Page 974>
[T]he court's action cannot
<SPage 534>
be reviewed
in a vacuum. The evidential underpinnings
of the verdict itself must be examined."

<EM>Asaro,</EM> 150 Conn. App. 442, 457-58, 91
A.3d 513 (2014).

<P20>Moreover, "[p]roper compensation
for noneconomic damages cannot be
computed by a mathematical formula, and
there is no precise rule for the assessment
of damages.... The plaintiff need not
prove damages with mathematical exactitude;
rather, the plaintiff must provide
sufficient evidence for the trier to make a
fair and reasonable estimate." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) Id. at 457, 91
A.3d 513; see also <EM>Commission on Human
Rights & Opportunities</EM> v. <EM>Cantillon,</EM> 347
Conn. 58, 68-69, 295 A.3d 919 (2023)
("Noneconomic damages, such as emotional
distress, pain and suffering, are, at best,
rather indefinite and speculative in nature
.... For more than fifty years, this
court has rejected the idea that any specific
yardstick can be applied to cabin the
discretion of the trier of fact when calculating
a fair and appropriate award of non-economic
damages." (Citation omitted; internal
quotation marks omitted.)).

<P20>The defendants assert that a remittitur
of the jury's verdict was necessary
because the plaintiffs failed to submit sufficient
evidence to establish their damages,
such as medical evidence or expert testimony
concerning their emotional distress,
leaving the jury without a means to determine
damages other than relying on passion,
prejudice, and speculation. The defendants
maintain that, rather than prove
their damages, the plaintiffs "focus[ed] ...
on arousing sympathy, directing anger,
and anchoring a large number before the
jury<fnr39> with the hope that [the] jurors
would do what
<SPage 535>
they did in this case&mdash;
award a fortune." (Footnote added.) We
disagree.<fnr40>
<Page 975>

<P20>Our review of the record reveals that
there was sufficient evidence to support
the $965,000,000 in compensatory damages
awarded by the jury. All of the plaintiffs
<SPage 536>
testified that, in the aftermath of the
Sandy Hook massacre, they endured traumatic
threats and harassment, conveyed,
inter alia, through social media, by mail, or
in person, stemming from the lies, as propagated
by the defendants, that the Sandy
Hook massacre was a hoax. Examples of
such threats and harassment included
death threats, claims that the plaintiffs
were actors, and accusations that the deceased
victims of the Sandy Hook massacre
were not real or were still alive. Additionally,
all of the plaintiffs testified to the
mental anguish and emotional harm that
they suffered as a result of the harrowing
threats and harassment they experienced.<fnr41>
The extent of the plaintiffs' damages
was established further by the testimony
of Watts, the plaintiffs' social media
expert, who testified that, on the basis of
data that he reviewed from three social
media platforms, namely, YouTube, Facebook,
and Twitter, the defendants' lies
about the Sandy Hook massacre reached a
minimum audience of 550 million people
between 2012 and 2018.

<P20>In sum, we agree with the court that the
evidence supported the jury's verdict and,
although substantial,
<SPage 537>
the verdict did not
"so [shock] the sense of justice as to compel
the conclusion that the jury [was] influenced
by partiality, prejudice, mistake or
corruption." (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) <EM>Ashmore</EM> v. <EM>Hartford Hospital,</EM>
supra, 331 Conn. at 782, 208 A.3d 256.
Accordingly, we conclude that the court
did not abuse its discretion in denying the
defendants' motion for a remittitur.
<Page 976>

<CN>V

<P20>The defendants' final claim is that the
trial court improperly concluded that the
plaintiffs asserted a legally viable CUTPA
claim. For the reasons that follow, we
agree.

<P20>We begin with a brief overview of CUTPA.
"CUTPA is, on its face, a remedial
statute that broadly prohibits unfair methods
of competition and unfair or deceptive
acts or practices in the conduct of any
trade or commerce.... To give effect to
its provisions, [General Statutes] &sect; 42-110g
(a)<fnr42> of [CUTPA] establishes a private
cause of action, available to [a]ny person
who suffers any ascertainable loss of money
or property, real or personal, as a result
of the use or employment of a method,
act or practice prohibited by [General
Statutes &sect;] 42-110b...." (Footnote added;

v. <EM>Bank of America, N.A.,</EM> 333
Conn. 769, 788, 219 A.3d 767 (2019). Section
42-110b (a), in turn, provides: "No
person shall engage in unfair methods of
competition and unfair or deceptive acts or
practices in the conduct of any trade or
commerce." Section 42-110a (4) defines
"`[t]rade' and `commerce'" as "the advertising,
the sale or rent or lease, the offering
for sale or rent or lease, or the
<SPage 538>
distribution of any services and any
property, tangible or intangible, real, personal
or mixed, and any other article, commodity,
or thing of value in this state."<fnr43>

<P20>The following additional procedural history
is relevant to our resolution of this
claim. To support their CUTPA claim in
their original complaint, in addition to incorporating
the allegations of the other
claims that they asserted, the plaintiffs
alleged, inter alia, that (1) the defendants
"unethically, oppressively, immorally, and
unscrupulously developed, propagated, and
disseminated outrageous and malicious lies
about the plaintiffs and their family members,
and they did so for profit,"<fnr44> (2) the
defendants engaged in a "campaign of lies,
abuse, and harassment, [which constituted]
a deceptive practice and offended public
policy," (3) the defendants' "reprehensible
conduct caused substantial injury to the
<Page 977>
plaintiffs and other consumers that [was]
not outweighed by any countervailing benefits
to anyone, and that the plaintiffs
themselves could not have
<SPage 539>
reasonably
avoided," (4) the defendants' "conduct was
a foreseeable cause of and a substantial
factor causing the plaintiffs' injury," and
(5) the defendants "broadcast their outrageous,
cruel, and malicious lies about the
plaintiffs with knowledge that the statements
were false and with reckless disregard
as to whether or not they were
true."<fnr45>

<P20>On October 9, 2020, the Jones defendants
filed a motion to strike, asserting in
relevant part that the plaintiffs' CUTPA
claim was insufficiently pleaded. On April
29, 2021, the plaintiffs filed an objection,
and, on June 4, 2021, the Jones defendants
filed a reply brief. On November 18, 2021,
the court denied the motion to strike. With
respect to the plaintiffs' CUTPA claim, the
court determined that "[a]n allegation of
defamatory conduct on the part of a defendant
is sufficiently wrongful to formulate
the underlying basis of a CUTPA cause of
action.... As the court is not striking the
plaintiffs' defamation claim, the plaintiffs'
[original] complaint sets forth allegations
of violations of public policy or otherwise
immoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous
conduct such that the plaintiffs allege
a legally sufficient CUTPA cause of
action." (Citations omitted.) The court further
determined that the plaintiffs had
standing to maintain their CUTPA claim,
stating that "the plaintiffs allege that the
[Jones] defendants `broadcast ... outrageous,
cruel and malicious lies about the
plaintiffs' and that `[t]hese acts of the
[Jones] defendants resulted in damage to
the plaintiffs.' Therefore, the plaintiffs
have set forth a colorable claim of direct
injury such that they have standing to
maintain their CUTPA cause of action."

<P20>On October 5, 2022, after the plaintiffs
had rested their case-in-chief at the hearing
in damages, the defendants' counsel
orally moved for a directed verdict and/or
<SPage 540>
to dismiss the plaintiffs' CUTPA
claim.<fnr46> The defendants' counsel argued in
relevant part that the plaintiffs were asserting
a "novel application" of CUTPA
because "there is no representation whatsoever
that the plaintiffs were harmed in
any respect by ... Jones' commercial activities
with respect to the sale of dietary
supplements.... There is no evidence that
anyone was harmed by his commercial activity
.... [N]othing in [his] speech, or the
consequences of that speech, addresses
what CUTPA is intended to address ...
and that is whether consumers were
harmed by ... the commercial activity
[affecting] trade or commerce.... [W]hat
we have here is a novel attempt to use
CUTPA to silence unpopular speech....
So, we think that CUTPA is being used for
inappropriate grounds and that the plaintiffs
lack standing to bring the action because
they cannot establish that they were
harmed by ... Jones' commercial activity
.... [T]here is no case ... that supports
what the plaintiffs intend to do in this case,
and that is [to] use ... a statute that is
designed to protect consumers against unscrupulous
trade and commercial practices
to attack speech.... [N]othing in our law
supports an application of CUTPA on the
fact[s] as pled and proven in this case." In
response, the plaintiffs' counsel argued in
relevant part: "With regard to the idea
that the CUTPA claim is only about statements,
it's not. What it describes is a
<Page 978>
commercial course of conduct that is built
on targeting and victimizing these families
by lying about them. So, certainly lies are
in the mix, but what the court heard was
not just the occasional lie, it's the use of
lies to sell products to fuel a business....
There is a business plan to hurt these
families and to sell things by hurting them.
And that has to be ... remediable under
CUTPA...." In rebuttal, the defendants'
counsel
<SPage 541>
argued that there was no precedent
providing that CUTPA applies when
(1) "a person engages in extreme comments
and relies on the sale of products to
produce that platform" and (2) there is no
evidence of harm stemming from the products
sold. The court rejected the defendants'
claims without additional comment.

<P20>Subsequently, in their motion to set
aside the jury's verdict, the defendants, in
essence, reasserted their prior contention
that the plaintiffs' CUTPA claim was legally
insufficient. In denying that motion, the
court determined in relevant part that
"CUTPA serves to deter predatory commercial
conduct such as [the conduct alleged
by the plaintiffs]. This court, in ruling
on the defendants' motion to strike,
already determined that `[a]n allegation of
defamatory conduct on the part of a defendant
is sufficiently wrongful conduct to
formulate the basis of a CUTPA cause of
action.' The [verdict] rendered by [the]
jury [is] not against the law or the evidence."<fnr47>

<P20>We construe the crux of the defendants'
claim on appeal to be that the conduct at
issue alleged by the plaintiffs and admitted
by operation of the defendants' default,
namely, the defendants' dissemination of
lies about the Sandy Hook massacre, was
insufficient to support a viable CUTPA
claim because their actions were not performed
"in the conduct of any trade or
commerce." General Statutes &sect; 42-110b (a).
The defendants posit that no CUTPA
claim arises here when (1) they did not lie
about or unscrupulously advertise the
products that they sold and (2) their actions
led to <EM>indirect</EM> commercial gains
through product sales. In short, the defendants
contend that they engaged in non-commercial
speech outside of the scope of
CUTPA. The
<SPage 542>
plaintiffs respond that,
"[w]hen using lies about [the] plaintiffs to
sell supplements, [the defendants were]
engaged in `unfair' and `deceptive' acts and
practices `in the conduct of' [their] `trade
or commerce.'" We conclude that, as a
matter of law, the acts in which the defendants
engaged were not "in the conduct of
any trade or commerce" as required pursuant
to CUTPA. See General Statutes
&sect; 42-110b (a).

<P20>"The interpretation of pleadings
is an issue of law.... We conduct a
plenary review of the pleadings to determine
whether they are sufficient to establish
a cause of action upon default." (Citation

Conn. App. 267, 276, 89 A.3d 373 (2014).

<P20>Before turning to the merits of
the defendants' claim, we note that the
default entered against the defendants
does not limit our review of this claim. "An
appellate court ... may examine the allegations
of a complaint to ascertain whether
they are sufficient on their face to establish
a valid claim for the relief requested....
<Page 979>
Although the failure of a party to
deny the material allegations of a pleading
operates so as to impliedly admit the allegations,
a default does not automatically
trigger judgment for, or the relief requested
by, the pleader. The pleader is entitled
to an entry of judgment or a grant of relief
as a function of the nonresponsive party's
default and the attendant implied admission
only when the allegations in the well
pleaded filing are sufficient on their face to
make out a claim for judgment or relief....
While an admission carries with it
all reasonable implications of fact and legal
conclusions ... the admission cannot traverse
beyond the bounds
<SPage 543>
of the underlying
pleading and admit allegations not
made by the pleader; the pleading is, unless
leave is granted to modify, the ceiling."
(Internal quotation marks omitted.)
<EM>Gaynor</EM> v. <EM>Hi-Tech Homes,</EM> supra, 149
Conn. App. at 274-75, 89 A.3d 373. "As
such, while a default admits the material
allegations of the underlying pleading, the
question as to whether the default requires
judgment in favor of the pleader is to be
determined by reference to the sufficiency
of the pleading itself." <EM>Commissioner of
Social Services</EM> v. <EM>Smith,</EM> 265 Conn. 723,
737, 830 A.2d 228 (2003). "Put another

see also id. at 225, 57 A.3d 872 ("[a] default
may settle many issues, but it does not
operate to insulate a mistaken legal proposition

<P20>For CUTPA to apply, there must be an
unfair or deceptive act or practice committed
"in the conduct of any trade or commerce."
General Statutes &sect; 42-110b (a);
see also <EM>Cenatiempo</EM> v. <EM>Bank of America,
N.A.,</EM> supra, 333 Conn. at 789, 219 A.3d
767 ("[t]o successfully state a claim for a
CUTPA violation, the plaintiffs must allege
that the defendant's acts occurred in
the conduct of trade or commerce"); <EM>Pellet</EM>
v. <EM>Keller Williams Realty Corp.,</EM> 177 Conn.
App. 42, 62, 172 A.3d 283 (2017) ("[t]he
essential elements to pleading a cause of
action under CUTPA are: (1) the defendant
committed an unfair or deceptive act
or practice; (2) <EM>the act complained of was
performed in the conduct of trade or commerce</EM>;
and (3) the prohibited act was the
proximate cause of harm to the plaintiff"
(emphasis added)). CUTPA defines
"`[t]rade' and `commerce'" as "the advertising,
the sale or rent or lease, the offering
for sale or rent or lease, or the distribution
of any services and any property,
tangible or
<SPage 544>
intangible, real, personal or
mixed, and any other article, commodity,
or thing of value in this state." General
Statutes &sect; 42-110a (4).

<P20>"Despite th[e] broad language [of &sect; 42-110a
(4)], the definition of trade and commerce
is not unlimited and has been used
to restrict the application of CUTPA."

Connecticut Practice Series: Connecticut
Unfair Trade Practices, Business Torts
and Antitrust (2024-2025 Ed.) &sect; 3.1, p. 117
("[b]ecause CUTPA applies only to acts `in
the conduct of any trade or commerce,'
there is a significant limitation on the
reach of [CUTPA]" (footnote omitted));
see, e.g., <EM>Sempey</EM> v. <EM>Stamford Hospital,</EM>
194 Conn. App. 505, 518, 221 A.3d 839
(2019) (trial court properly struck CUTPA
count predicated on allegations that former
employer made false statements to
State of Connecticut Unemployment Commission
regarding former employee's reliability
and integrity because, inter alia,
employee failed to allege that employer
committed any acts in "`conduct of any
trade or commerce'").
<Page 980>

<P20>Exercising our plenary review, we
conclude that the facts alleged by the
plaintiffs and admitted by the defendants
are legally insufficient to satisfy the "trade
or commerce" prong of CUTPA. As we
have explained, the conduct forming the
basis of the plaintiffs' CUTPA claim was
the defendants' propagation of lies that the
Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax. Applying
the statutory definition of "`[t]rade'
and `commerce'" set forth in &sect; 42-110a (4)
(i.e., "the advertising, the sale or rent or
lease, the offering for sale or rent or lease,
or the distribution of any services and any
property, tangible or intangible, real, personal
or mixed, and any other article, commodity,
or thing of value in this state"), we
cannot conclude that the defendants violated
CUTPA
<SPage 545>
in disseminating their lies
about the Sandy Hook massacre. That the
defendants' speech was motivated by a
desire to generate profit through sales of
products that the defendants marketed is
not adequate to satisfy the "trade or commerce"
prong of CUTPA. Indeed, nothing
in the defendants' speech, in and of itself,
concerning the Sandy Hook massacre
made any mention of their products.

<P20>In their respective appellate briefs, the
plaintiffs and the defendants address our
Supreme Court's decision in <EM>Soto</EM> v. <EM>Bushmaster
Firearms International, LLC,</EM> 331
Conn. 53, 202 A.3d 262, cert. denied sub
nom. <EM>Remington Arms Co., LLC</EM> v. <EM>Soto,</EM>
___ U.S. ___, 140 S. Ct. 513, 205 L. Ed.
2d 317 (2019). In <EM>Soto,</EM> several plaintiffs,
acting as the administrators of the estates
of nine of the victims of the Sandy Hook
massacre; id. at 65, 66, 202 A.3d 262 n.2;
commenced an action against several defendants
who were alleged to have manufactured,
distributed, and sold (to Lanza's
mother) the weapon used by Lanza at
Sandy Hook&mdash;a Bushmaster XM15-E2S
semiautomatic rifle. Id. at 65-66, 202 A.3d
262. The plaintiffs asserted a number of
legal theories seeking to hold the defendants
liable in part for the Sandy Hook
massacre, most of which our Supreme
Court determined to be precluded by Connecticut
law and/or the Protection of Lawful
Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), Pub.
L. No. 109-92, 119 Stat. 2095 (2005), codified
at 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 7901 through 7903
(2012). Id. at 65, 202 A.3d 262.

<P20>Our Supreme Court concluded, however,
that the plaintiffs "offered one narrow legal
theory" that was recognized pursuant
to Connecticut law and not precluded by
PLCAA. Id. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged
that "the defendants violated CUTPA<fnr48>
by advertising
<SPage 546>
and marketing the
XM15-E2S in an unethical, oppressive, immoral,
and unscrupulous manner that promoted
illegal offensive use of the rifle" and
"that such promotional tactics were causally
related to some or all of the injuries that
were inflicted during the Sandy Hook massacre."
(Footnote added.) Id. at 86-87, 202
A.3d 262. The trial court struck this CUTPA
claim, along with a distinct claim by
the plaintiffs alleging that the sale of the
XM15-E2S to the civilian market, ipso facto,
constituted an unfair trade practice, on
the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing
stemming from their status as "third-party
victims who did not have a direct
consumer, commercial, or competitor relationship
... with the defendants." Id. at
88, 202 A.3d 262. Our Supreme Court determined
that the trial court erred in striking
the plaintiffs' CUTPA claims, reasoning:
"Because the principal evils associated
with unscrupulous and illegal advertising
are not ones that necessarily arise from or
infect the relationship between an advertiser
and its customers, competitors, or
<Page 981>
business associates, we hold that a party
directly injured by conduct resulting from
such advertising can bring an action pursuant
to CUTPA even in the absence of a
business relationship with the defendant."
Id. Our Supreme Court further clarified
that it did not "need [to] decide today
whether there are other contexts or situations
in which parties who do not share a
consumer, commercial, or competitor relationship
with an alleged wrongdoer may be
barred, for prudential or policy reasons,
from bringing a CUTPA action. What is
clear is that none of the rationales that
underlie the standing doctrine, either generally
or in the specific context of unfair
trade practice litigation, supports the denial
of standing to the plaintiffs in this case."
Id. at 96, 202 A.3d 262. Thus, the court
held that the plaintiffs had standing with
respect to their "narrow legal theory" under
CUTPA because they alleged direct
injuries from conduct resulting from
wrongful advertising. Id. at 65, 99-100, 202
A.3d 262.
<SPage 547>

<P20>The allegations underlying the CUTPA
claim deemed viable in <EM>Soto</EM> are, however,
materially distinguishable from the
allegations in the underlying consolidated
actions and do not lend the plaintiffs support
with respect to their allegation that
the defendants acted "in the conduct of
any trade or commerce" for purposes of
CUTPA. As in <EM>Soto,</EM> the plaintiffs in this
case did not allege that they were consumers,
competitors, or otherwise in a business
or commercial relationship with the defendants.
Unlike the plaintiffs in <EM>Soto,</EM> however,
the plaintiffs in this case did not allege
that they were "directly injured by conduct
resulting from" the defendants' advertising
or sale of the defendants' products,
such that they could "bring an action
pursuant to CUTPA even in the absence of
a business relationship with the defendant[s]."
<EM>Soto</EM> v. <EM>Bushmaster Firearms International,
LLC,</EM> supra, 331 Conn. at 88,
202 A.3d 262. Thus, notwithstanding <EM>Soto</EM>'s
elimination of the commercial relationship
test, the plaintiffs did not allege direct
injury from the defendants' <EM>advertising</EM> or
<EM>sale</EM> of the defendants' products and, thus,
did not fall within the expansion of CUTPA
liability established in <EM>Soto.</EM> Rather,
they alleged injuries from the defendants'
<EM>false speech</EM> about the Sandy Hook massacre
&mdash;speech that itself was silent with regard
to the defendants' products. Stated
differently, the plaintiffs did not allege direct
injury from commercial speech relating
to the advertising, marketing, or sale
of goods, as in <EM>Soto.</EM> To extend CUTPA's
reach to provide a remedy (in addition to
the torts of invasion of privacy by false
light, defamation, defamation per se, and
intentional infliction of emotional distress)
for content of speech unrelated to the advertising,
marketing, or sale of products is
simply a bridge too far.

<P20>In sum, we conclude that the plaintiffs
failed to assert a legally viable CUTPA
claim. As a result, the judgments rendered
with respect to the plaintiffs' CUTPA
claim
<SPage 548>
must be reversed and the attendant
award entered pursuant to CUTPA,
namely, the $150,000,000 in punitive damages
awarded by the court, must be vacated.

<P20>The judgments are reversed only as to
the plaintiffs' CUTPA claim and the cases
are remanded with direction to vacate the
court's award of $150,000,000 in punitive
damages pursuant to CUTPA; the judgments
are affirmed in all other respects.

<P20>In this opinion the other judges
concurred.
<FN>
<fnt1> Several additional defendants were named
in the underlying consolidated actions, namely,
Infowars, LLC, Infowars Health, LLC,
Prison Planet TV, LLC, Wolfgang Halbig,
Cory T. Sklanka, Genesis Communications
Network, Inc., and Midas Resources, Inc.
Jones and Free Speech Systems, LLC, however,
were the only remaining defendants at the
time of the judgments rendered following the
jury verdicts returned in the underlying consolidated
actions. We refer in this opinion to
(1) Jones and Free Speech Systems, LLC,
collectively, as the defendants, and (2) Jones,
Free Speech Systems, LLC, Infowars, LLC,
Infowars Health, LLC, and Prison Planet TV,
LLC, collectively, as the Jones defendants.

<fnt2> "There are three underlying actions. In the
first action, the plaintiffs are Erica Lafferty,
David Wheeler, Francine Wheeler, Jacqueline
Barden, Mark Barden, Nicole Hockley, Ian
Hockley, Jennifer Hensel, Jeremy Richman,
Donna Soto, Carlee Soto-Parisi, Carlos Soto,
Jillian Soto, and William Aldenberg. On November
29, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to consolidate
the second and third cases ... with
their action pursuant to Practice Book &sect; 9-5.
William Sherlach is a plaintiff in the second
and third cases and Robert Parker is a plaintiff
in the third case. On December 17, 2018,
the court granted the motion to consolidate
the cases. Jeremy Richman died while this
action was pending, and, on June 7, 2021, the
court granted the plaintiffs' motion to substitute
Jennifer Hensel, executrix of the estate of
Jeremy Richman, as a plaintiff in his place;
however, on June 8, 2021, Jennifer Hensel, in
her capacity as executrix of the estate of Jeremy
Richman, withdrew her claims against the
defendants. On October 20, 2021, the court
granted Erica Lafferty's motion to substitute
Richard Coan, trustee of the bankruptcy estate
of Erica L. Garbatini [also known as
Erica Lafferty], in her place as a plaintiff in
this case." (Citations omitted.) <EM>Lafferty</EM> v.
<EM>Jones,</EM> 222 Conn. App. 855, 858 n.1, 307 A.3d
923 (2023). On December 14, 2023, the court
granted a motion to substitute Erica L. Ash,
also known as Erica Lafferty, as a plaintiff in
place of Richard Coan, trustee of the bankruptcy
estate of Erica L. Garbatini. All references
in this opinion to the plaintiffs are to
the remaining plaintiffs and do not include
Jeremy Richman, Jennifer Hensel, as executrix
of the estate of Jeremy Richman, or Richard
Coan, trustee of the bankruptcy estate of
Erica L. Garbatini.

<fnt3> The motions and pleadings filed in each of
the underlying consolidated actions were
largely identical, and the jury verdict returned
in each action was the same. In the interest of
simplicity, unless otherwise deemed necessary,
we refer to the motions, pleadings, and
other documents filed in the controlling action.
See <EM>Lafferty</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM> Superior Court,
judicial district of Waterbury, Complex Litigation
Docket, Docket No. CV-18-6046436-S.

<fnt4> In an accompanying request for leave to
amend their complaint, the plaintiffs represented
that the amended complaint (1) removed
the negligent infliction of emotional
distress count previously alleged, (2) removed
former defendants, and (3) "simplifie[d] the
pleadings by providing a single, uniform complaint
for the hearing in damages of the [underlying]
consolidated cases...."

against public participation'...." <EM>Lafferty</EM> v.
<EM>Jones,</EM> supra, 336 Conn. at 337 n.4, 246 A.3d
429.

<fnt6> Section 52-196a was amended by No. 19-64,
&sect; 17, of the 2019 Public Acts, which made
changes to the statute that are not relevant to
these appeals. Accordingly, we refer to the
current revision of the statute.

<fnt7> In their principal appellate brief, the defendants
represent that "Google Analytics is proprietary
data made available to subscribers on
a server maintained by Google. It is described
thus on Google's webpage: `Google Analytics
is a web analytics service offered by Google
that tracks and reports website traffic and
also the mobile app traffic [and] events, currently
inside a platform inside the Google
Marketing Platform brand.'"

<fnt8> The proceedings in the underlying consolidated
actions were stayed pending our Supreme
Court's resolution of the public interest
appeal, and, on October 27, 2020, the trial
court denied a request by the Jones defendants
to stay discovery further.

<fnt9> On November 18, 2020, the Jones defendants
filed a notice that the underlying consolidated
actions had been removed to the
United States District Court for the District of
Connecticut. The actions were remanded
from the District Court on March 5, 2021.

<fnt10> The Jones defendants further represented
that, to export the Google Analytics data, Free
Speech Systems, LLC, would be required to
purchase an upgraded membership account
at a cost of $150,000.

<fnt11> The Jones defendants defined "`[s]andboxing'"
as "`a computer security term referring
to when a program is set aside from other
programs in a separate environment so that if
errors or security issues occur, those issues
will not spread to other areas on the computer.
Programs are enabled in their own sequestered
area, where they can be worked on
without posing any threat to other programs.'"

<fnt12> On July 1, 2021, all of the Jones defendants,
except for Jones, were represented by
both Attorney Jay Marshall Wolman and Pattis
& Smith, LLC. At that time, Jones was
represented by Wolman only.

<fnt13> Jones did not join the motion to depose
Clinton, and Infowars, LLC, was not listed as
one of the movants. In subsequent filings,
including an August 3, 2021 reply brief vis-&agrave;-vis
the motion to depose Clinton, Infowars,
LLC, was treated as an additional movant.

<fnt14> The protective order was twice amended
further in 2022.

<fnt15> The protective order limited access to materials
designated as "Confidential Information"
or "Highly Confidential-Attorneys Eyes
Only" to certain categories of persons. The
protective order further provided in relevant
part: "Depositions involving Confidential Information
shall be treated, as follows:

<B42>"a. Portions of a deposition or depositions
in their entirety may be designated Confidential
Information or HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEYS EYES ONLY by counsel for the
deponent or the Designating Party [as defined
in the protective order], with respect to documents
or information that it has produced, by
requesting such treatment on the record at
the deposition or in writing no later than
thirty (30) days after the date of the deposition.

<B42>"b. This Protective Order shall permit temporary
designation of an entire transcript as
Confidential Information or HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEYS EYES ONLY where
less than all of the testimony in that transcript
would fall into those categories, subject to [a
procedure detailed in the protective order]
.... The designations shall remain effective
until and unless an objection is made and
finally resolved."

<fnt16> The plaintiffs contended that the motion to
depose Clinton should be treated as having
been filed by all of the Jones defendants. See
footnote 13 of this opinion.

<fnt17> On August 4, 2021, the court denied the
motion to depose Clinton. That ruling is not at
issue in these consolidated appeals.

<fnt18> Attached as an exhibit to the July 6, 2021
motion was an affidavit of Brian W. Merrill, a
certified fraud examiner and a certified analytics
professional, who averred in relevant
part that "[a] trial balance is a standard accounting
report listing a company's general
ledger accounts. A debit or credit balance is
presented for each general ledger account.
The purpose of a trial balance is to prove that
the value of all debit balances equals the
value of all credit balances. Subsidiary ledgers
(`[s]ubledgers') contain the transactional
detail that support the trial balance details for
all general ledger accounts in an accounting
system. Subledgers allow for the interpretation
and analysis of the financial activity that
is recorded in the books and records that
ultimately represent the financial statement of
the organization."

<P20>On November 6, 2020, the Jones defendants
objected to the production request seeking the
trial balances and subsidiary ledgers on the
grounds that the request was, inter alia, overbroad,
irrelevant, and unduly burden-some.
The court overruled the objection.

<fnt19> On May 5, 2021, the Jones defendants filed
an emergency motion for a protective order
requesting in part that Flores' deposition,
scheduled for May 7, 2021, be rescheduled for
medical reasons. On May 6, 2021, the court
ordered Flores' deposition to be rescheduled
but further directed that "[t]he records requested
in the request to produce are ordered
to be produced by the close of business on
[May 14, 2021]. Failure to comply with this
order may result in sanctions."

<fnt20> On October 7, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a
memorandum of law in favor of the court
defaulting the Jones defendants for their misconduct.
On October 20, 2021, the Jones defendants
filed a memorandum of law in opposition
to a default order.

<fnt21> The court further observed that the Jones
defendants previously had asserted a different
argument, namely, that the inclusion of the
"Highly Confidential-Attorneys Eyes Only" information
in the motion to depose Clinton
was justified because the plaintiffs lacked a
good faith basis to designate the deposition at
issue as "Highly Confidential-Attorneys Eyes
Only" pursuant to the protective order. The
court rejected that argument.

<fnt22> As the court explained, (1) the motion to
depose Clinton, filed by Pattis, listed Free
Speech Systems, LLC, Infowars Health, LLC,
and Prison Planet TV, LLC, as the movants,
(2) in the July 19, 2021 objection to the plaintiffs'
July 6, 2021 motion for sanctions, also
filed by Pattis, Infowars, LLC, was treated as
an additional movant, and (3) during argument,
Wolman represented that Infowars,
LLC, had no involvement in the motion to
depose Clinton because its name was not listed
in the motion.

<fnt23> The court referred to August 8, 2021, as
the date of the production of the spreadsheets;
however, (1) during argument preceding
the court's sanctions order, the plaintiffs'
counsel represented that the spreadsheets had
been produced on October 8, 2021, and (2)
the record reflects that the Jones defendants
filed a notice of compliance dated October 8,
2021.

<fnt24> The defendants make a passing reference
to these other analytics in their principal appellate
brief. Insofar as the defendants attempt
to raise a claim of error specifically as
to these other analytics, they have not adequately
briefed any such claim. See <EM>Lafferty</EM> v.
<EM>Jones,</EM> supra, 336 Conn. at 375 n.30, 246 A.3d
429. Thus, we do not set forth additional
context vis-&agrave;-vis these other analytics.

<fnt25> As we explained in footnote 13 of this
opinion, although Free Speech Systems, LLC,
was one of the movants of the motion to
depose Clinton, Jones did not join the motion.
The defendants on appeal do not claim that
Jones was sanctioned improperly vis-&agrave;-vis the
protective order; on the contrary, both defendants
&mdash;Jones and Free Speech Systems,
LLC&mdash;claim error as to the court's ruling regarding
the violation of the protective order
and assert that the court attributed the violation
to them rather than to their counsel.
Accordingly, for purposes of our resolution of
the defendants' claims in part I of this opinion
and notwithstanding the convoluted background
concerning the identity of the movants
of the motion to depose Clinton, we do
not differentiate between Jones and Free
Speech Systems, LLC, with regard to the motion
to depose Clinton and the court's rulings
concerning the protective order.

<fnt26> The defendants raise a number of additional
claims, which we decline to review. First,
in their reply brief, the defendants contend
for the first time that, as a matter of law,
"there should be an outer limit on a trial
court's authority to enter a default in civil
cases. Failure adequately or substantially to
comply with discovery should never result in
a default." We decline to consider this discrete
legal issue raised for the first time in the
defendants' reply brief. See <EM>Anderson-Harris</EM>
v. <EM>Harris,</EM> 221 Conn. App. 222, 253 n.24, 301
A.3d 1090 (2023) ("[i]t [is] axiomatic that
arguments cannot be raised for the first time
in a reply brief"). Even if some semblance of
this claim can be gleaned from the defendants'
principal appellate brief, we conclude
that the defendants have abandoned the claim
as a result of their failure to brief it adequately
in their main brief and notwithstanding
their attempt to expound on it in their reply
brief. See <EM>Robb</EM> v. <EM>Connecticut Board of Veterinary
Medicine,</EM> 204 Conn. App. 595, 613 n.23,
254 A.3d 915 ("[T]he plaintiff cannot use his
reply brief to resurrect a claim that he has
abandoned by failing to adequately brief it in
his principal appellate brief. See <EM>Hurley</EM> v.
<EM>Heart Physicians, P.C.,</EM> 298 Conn. 371, 378
n.6, 3 A.3d 892 (2010) (declining to consider
claim when appellant raised `vague assertion'
of claim in principal appellate brief and later
`amplified her discussion of the issue considerably
in her reply brief')."), cert. denied, 338
Conn. 911, 259 A.3d 654 (2021). Accordingly,
insofar as the defendants claim that the default
entered against them was a disproportionate
sanction, we limit our analysis to the
parameters of the claim adequately briefed by
the defendants, namely, that the sanction constituted
an abuse of the court's discretion on
the basis of the record.

<P20>Second, in their principal appellate brief,
the defendants claim that "[a] liability default
is never appropriate in a case involving
speech, given the importance the Connecticut
constitution places on speech." The defendants
cite article first, &sect; 6, of the Connecticut
constitution, which, as they concede, applies
only to criminal prosecutions; see <EM>Gray</EM> v.
<EM>Mossman,</EM> 91 Conn. 430, 442-43, 99 A. 1062
(1917); and which provides: "In all prosecutions
or indictments for libels, the truth may
be given in evidence, and the jury shall have
the right to determine the law and the facts,
under the direction of the court." Conn.
Const., art. I, &sect; 6. The defendants' principal
appellate brief is bereft of any substantive
legal analysis to support this claim, and,
therefore, we deem it to be abandoned. See
<EM>Lafferty</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM> supra, 336 Conn. at 375
n.30, 246 A.3d 429.

<P20>Third, in their principal appellate brief, the
defendants assert that the court, in its August
6, 2021 order addressing the subsidiary ledgers
issue, improperly discredited the Roe affidavit
without an evidentiary hearing. The defendants
contend that "[t]he absence of a
meaningful evidentiary record to support this
finding as to ... Roe, a finding that bore such
fatal consequences for the defendants, constitutes
an abuse of discretion...." The defendants
have abandoned this claim by failing to
provide any substantive legal analysis to support
it. See <EM>Lafferty</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM> supra, 336 Conn.
at 375 n.30, 246 A.3d 429.

<P20>Last, in their principal appellate brief, the
defendants assert that "the trial court never
set forth just what it thought Google Analytics
was. As such, the order [regarding Google
Analytics] was not so clear and unambiguous
as to warrant a default if, in fact, the order
was violated at all." We deem this claim to be
inadequately briefed and, therefore, the defendants
have abandoned it. See <EM>Lafferty</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM>
supra, 336 Conn. at 375 n.30, 246 A.3d 429.

<fnt27> Practice Book (Rev. to 2021) &sect; 13-14 provides
in relevant part: "(a) If any party has
failed to answer interrogatories or to answer
them fairly, or has intentionally answered
them falsely or in a manner calculated to
mislead, or has failed to respond to requests
for production or for disclosure of the existence
and contents of an insurance policy or
the limits thereof, or has failed to submit to a
physical or mental examination, or has failed
to comply with a discovery order made pursuant
to Section 13-13, or has failed to comply
with the provisions of Section 13-15, or has
failed to appear and testify at a deposition
duly noticed pursuant to this chapter, or has
failed otherwise substantially to comply with
any other discovery order made pursuant to
Sections 13-6 through 13-11, the judicial authority
may, on motion, make such order as
the ends of justice require.

<P20>"(b) Such orders may include the following:

<P20>"(1) The entry of a nonsuit or default
against the party failing to comply...."

<fnt28> "A finding of fact is clearly erroneous
when there is no evidence in the record to
support it ... or when although there is evidence
to support it, the reviewing court on
the entire evidence is left with the definite
and firm conviction that a mistake has been
committed." (Internal quotation marks omitted.)
<EM>Fernwood Realty, LLC</EM> v. <EM>AeroCision,
LLC,</EM> 166 Conn. App. 345, 356, 141 A.3d 965,
cert. denied, 323 Conn. 912, 149 A.3d 981
(2016).

<fnt29> An amendment to Practice Book &sect; 13-9,
effective January 1, 2022, made changes to
the provision that are not relevant to these
appeals. Accordingly, we refer to the current
revision of this provision.

<fnt30> The defendants also argue that, as a less
severe alternative to a default, the plaintiffs
could have asserted a cause of action for
intentional spoliation of evidence or the
court could have provided a spoliation
charge to the jury. See <EM>Rizzuto</EM> v. <EM>Davidson
Ladders, Inc.,</EM> 280 Conn. 225, 243, 905 A.2d
1165 (2006) (recognizing independent cause
of action for intentional spoliation of evidence,
defined as "`the intentional destruction,
mutilation, or significant alteration of
potential evidence for the purpose of defeating
another person's recovery in a civil action'").
The plaintiffs counter that the law of
spoliation is inapplicable because "there is
no question that [the defendants] had&mdash;and
simply withheld&mdash;financial and analytics
compliance. Moreover, a spoliation charge
would not have remedied the prejudice to
the plaintiffs from [the defendants'] misrepresentations
regarding the existence of discovery,
prolonged delays in providing the
compliance [they] did provide, and complete
refusal to provide other compliance, or from
[the defendants'] wilful violation of the protective
order." We agree with the plaintiffs
that the law of spoliation did not provide a
reasonable alternative to the court's default
order.

<fnt31> As we concluded in part I B of this opinion,
we reject the defendants' claim that the
court's finding that they wilfully violated the
discovery orders was clearly erroneous.

<fnt32> The defendants refer to the court's jury
charge, wherein the court instructed the jury
in relevant part: "I hereby charge you that
causation of the plaintiffs' damages is already
established.... Causation of harm has been
established by virtue of the court's prior rulings
to the satisfaction of the law. That is, it
has been established in this case that the
defendants proximately caused harm to the
plaintiffs by spreading lies about the plaintiffs
to their audience and the public by urging
their audience and the public to investigate
and look into the plaintiffs and to stop the
people supposedly behind the Sandy Hook
hoax, resulting in members of the defendants'
audience and the public cyberstalking, attacking,
harassing, and threatening the plaintiffs,
as you have heard in the evidence in this case.
In sum, it has been established that the defendants
caused harm to the plaintiffs in all the
ways I just described. The defendants' statements
and conduct caused reputational harm
to the plaintiffs, invasion of privacy, and emotional
distress. The extent of the harm is what
you will be measuring in your verdict. The
cause of the harm is not in question."

<fnt33> In their principal appellate brief, the defendants
make vague references to (1) "a series
of bizarre evidentiary rulings" by the court
that "eviscerated the requirement that [the]
plaintiffs prove the extent of their damages,"
(2) the court's improper admission of evidence,
(3) the court failing to determine
which of the plaintiffs' allegations were "material,"
(4) the court instructing the jury that
liability had been "`established,'" and (5) the
court denying a motion in limine filed by the
defendants requesting that the transcript of its
November 15, 2021 ruling defaulting the defendants
be admissible at the hearing in damages.
Insofar as the defendants attempt to
raise claims of error with respect to these
discrete issues, they have failed to brief such
claims adequately and, therefore, we deem
any such claims to be abandoned. See <EM>Lafferty</EM>
v. <EM>Jones,</EM> supra, 336 Conn. at 375 n.30, 246
A.3d 429.

<P20>Additionally, in their principal appellate
brief, the defendants repeatedly state that the
jury was unaware that liability was established
against the defendants as the result of a
disciplinary default. In their reply brief, the
defendants assert for the first time that the
court committed error in failing to notify the
jury that the defendants were defaulted as a
disciplinary sanction. We decline to review
this claim, as it is (1) improperly raised for
the first time in the defendants' reply brief or
(2) inadequately briefed, even if cognizably
raised in the defendants' principal appellate
brief. See <EM>Anderson-Harris</EM> v. <EM>Harris,</EM> 221
Conn. App. 222, 253 n.24, 301 A.3d 1090
(2023); <EM>Robb</EM> v. <EM>Connecticut Board of Veterinary
Medicine,</EM> 204 Conn. App. 595, 613 n.23,
254 A.3d 915, cert. denied, 338 Conn. 911,
259 A.3d 654 (2021); see also footnote 26 of
this opinion.

<fnt34> We note that, "[a]fter a default, a defendant
may still contest liability. Practice Book
&sect;&sect; 17-34, 17-35 and 17-37 delineate a defendant's
right to contest liability in a hearing in
damages after default. Unless the defendant
provides the plaintiff written notice of any
defenses, the defendant is foreclosed from
contesting liability.... If written notice is furnished
to the plaintiff, the defendant may
offer evidence contradicting any allegation of
the complaint and may challenge the right of
the plaintiff to maintain the action or prove
any matter of defense.... This approximates
what the defendant would have been able to
do if he had filed an answer and special
defenses." (Citations omitted; footnote omitted;
internal quotation marks omitted.)
<EM>Schwartz</EM> v. <EM>Milazzo,</EM> 84 Conn. App. 175, 178-79,
852 A.2d 847, cert. denied, 271 Conn.
942, 861 A.2d 515 (2004). On November 24,
2021, following the entry of the default
against them, the defendants filed a notice of
defenses, which was stricken by the court on
December 24, 2021. The defendants on appeal
do not challenge the propriety of the court's
order striking the notice of defenses.

<fnt35> The defendants cite the following language
in <EM>Murray</EM> to support their claim: "`[E]ven in
a hearing in damages ... a plaintiff must still
prove that the damages claimed were caused
by the conduct alleged.'" <EM>Murray</EM> v. <EM>Taylor,</EM>
supra, 65 Conn. App. at 333, 782 A.2d 702.
The source of that language, however, is the
trial court decision that this court reversed on
appeal. See id. at 332-35, 340, 782 A.2d 702.
The defendants' reliance on that language,
therefore, is untenable.

<fnt36> In footnotes, the court (1) observed that, in
contrast to the defendants' "conclusory motion,"
the plaintiffs "in their objection painstakingly
and accurately highlight[ed] the evidence
submitted" and (2) iterated that it was
not obligated to consider inadequately briefed
claims.

<fnt37> The jury submitted several notes during its
deliberations.

<fnt38> The defendants assert that we should exercise
plenary review over their claim because
the jury's verdict "shocks the sense of justice"
in violation of their due process rights. The
defendants provide no legal authority in support
of this assertion. We, instead, apply the
well settled standard of review and examine
the court's decision for an abuse of discretion.

<fnt39> The defendants reference the plaintiffs'
closing argument, during which the plaintiffs'
counsel, in addressing damages for defamation
and slander, proposed that the jury consider
(1) picking a number representing a
reasonable amount to award to one individual,
assuming that a lie about that individual
had been told to one person, and (2) multiplying
that number first by 550 million, which,
according to testimony elicited from Watts,
represented the minimum audience that the
defendants' lies about Sandy Hook reached
between 2012 and 2018, and then by fifteen,
or the number of plaintiffs in the underlying
consolidated actions.

<fnt40> The defendants raise two additional assertions
that we discuss briefly. First, the defendants
contend that, to comport with due process,
the plaintiffs were required to present
evidence that estimated their damages so as
to provide "some notice as to the magnitude
of [the] harm" suffered. As before the trial
court, the defendants have failed to provide
any substantive legal analysis to support this
claim, and, therefore, we deem it to be abandoned.
See <EM>Lafferty</EM> v. <EM>Jones,</EM> supra, 336 Conn.
at 375 n.30, 246 A.3d 429. Moreover, we
iterate our Supreme Court's recent statement
that "[n]oneconomic damages, such as emotional
distress, pain and suffering, are, at best,
rather indefinite and speculative in nature....
For more than fifty years, [our Supreme
Court] has rejected the idea that any
specific yardstick can be applied to cabin the
discretion of the trier of fact when calculating
a fair and appropriate award of noneconomic
damages." (Citation omitted; internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Commission on Human
Rights & Opportunities</EM> v. <EM>Cantillon,</EM> supra,
347 Conn. at 68-69, 295 A.3d 919. We also
observe that, under Connecticut law, in civil
actions seeking the recovery of damages resulting
from personal injury, counsel is entitled,
but not required, to present argument on
the amount of past and future noneconomic
damages. See General Statutes &sect; 52-216b (a)
("[i]n any civil action to recover damages
resulting from personal injury or wrongful
death, counsel for any party to the action
shall be entitled to specifically articulate to
the trier of fact during closing arguments, in
lump sums or by mathematical formulae, the
amount of past and future economic and non-economic
damages claimed to be recoverable");
see also Practice Book &sect; 16-19 ("In any
action seeking damages for injury to the person,
the amount demanded in the complaint
shall not be disclosed to the jury. In the event
that the jury shall return a verdict which
exceeds the amount demanded, the judicial
authority shall reduce the award to, and render
judgment in, the amount demanded.
Counsel for any party to the action may articulate
to the jury during closing argument a
lump sum or mathematical formula as to
damages claimed to be recoverable.").

<P20>Second, the defendants assert that the jury
awarded the plaintiffs punitive, rather than
compensatory, damages. The record does not
support this assertion. Our review of the
court's jury charge reflects that the court instructed
the jury that its task was to determine
compensatory damages, and the court
expressly instructed the jury that, "[u]nder
the rule [of] compensatory damages, the purpose
of an award of damages is not to punish
or penalize the defendants for their wrongdoing
but to compensate the plaintiffs for the
resulting harms and losses." Moreover, the
court separately instructed the jury that (1)
the plaintiffs were seeking punitive damages
in the form of attorney's fees and costs, and
(2) the jury was to determine whether punitive
damages were to be awarded, with the
court to determine the amount thereof if
awarded. In a section of the verdict form
titled "Compensatory Damages," the jury
awarded the plaintiffs a total of $965,000,000
in damages, comprising past and future "defamation/slander"
and emotional distress damages.
In a separate section of the verdict
form, the jury determined that the plaintiffs
were entitled to attorney's fees and costs. The
defendants do not challenge the propriety of
the jury instructions, and, "in the absence of a
showing that the jury failed or declined to
follow the court's instructions, we presume
that the jury followed them." <EM>Audibert</EM> v.
<EM>Halle,</EM> 198 Conn. App. 472, 482, 233 A.3d
1237 (2020). Thus, we reject the defendants'
contention that the $965,000,000 awarded by
the jury to the plaintiffs constituted punitive,
rather than compensatory, damages.

<fnt41> Insofar as the defendants argue that the
plaintiffs were required to produce medical or
expert testimony to corroborate their testimony
concerning their emotional distress, the
defendants provide no legal support for this
assertion. Cf. <EM>Patino</EM> v. <EM>Birken Mfg. Co.,</EM> 304
Conn. 679, 707 n.25, 41 A.3d 1013 (2012)
(rejecting defendant's argument that plaintiff's
testimony regarding emotional distress
was insufficient without corroboration by
medical or expert testimony).

<fnt42> General Statutes &sect; 42-110g (a) provides in
relevant part: "Any person who suffers any
ascertainable loss of money or property, real
or personal, as a result of the use or employment
of a method, act or practice prohibited
by section 42-110b, may bring an action in
the judicial district in which the plaintiff or
defendant resides or has his principal place of
business or is doing business, to recover actual
damages...."

<fnt43> CUTPA "refers to `trade or commerce' in
the substantive provision, &sect; 42-110b (a), but
contains a definition of `"trade"' and `"commerce"'
in the definitions provision, &sect; 42-110a
(4). The definition seems to equate the
disjunctive with the conjunctive relationship
of the two terms and interpret the two terms
as having a single meaning or a combined
inclusive meaning." R. Langer et al., 12 Connecticut
Practice Series: Connecticut Unfair
Trade Practices, Business Torts and Antitrust
(2024-2025 Ed.) &sect; 3.1, p. 117 n.2.

<fnt44> The plaintiffs further alleged, for instance,
that, "[o]nce he has their attention and trust,
Jones exploits his audience by selling them
products in line with the paranoid worldview
he promotes. In [Jones'] [I]nternet based and
broadcast radio shows, the ... defendants
hawk `open currency' precious metals, prepackaged
food and dietary supplements,
`male enhancement' elixirs and radiation-defeating
iodine tablets, gas masks and body
armor, and various customized AR-15 `lower
receivers' (the extruded metal frame that encloses
the breach, ammunition feed and firing
mechanism of the rifle).... [T]he ... defendants
concoct elaborate and false paranoiatinged
conspiracy theories because it moves
product and they make money. Jones and his
subordinates say what they say not because
they are eager to educate or even to entertain
their audience. Rather, they deliberately stoke
social anxiety and political discord in their
listeners, because distrust in government and
cultural tribalism motivate[s] those listeners
to buy their products." (Footnote omitted.)

<fnt45> The allegations in support of the plaintiffs'
CUTPA claim were substantively identical in
the plaintiffs' respective original complaints,
as well as in their September, 2022 amended
complaint.

<fnt46> On October 6, 2022, the defendants filed a
written version of their oral motion.

<fnt47> The defendants raised additional claims directed
to the plaintiffs' CUTPA claim, including
that the plaintiffs failed to plead the ascertainable
loss element of a CUTPA claim. The
court rejected these claims, and the defendants
do not pursue these issues on appeal.

<fnt48> The plaintiffs in <EM>Soto</EM> brought their claims
pursuant to Connecticut's wrongful death
statute, General Statutes &sect; 52-555, predicated
in part on alleged CUTPA violations. <EM>Soto</EM> v.
<EM>Bushmaster Firearms International, LLC,</EM> supra,
331 Conn. at 67, 202 A.3d 262.

<P20>The self-represented defendant, Nancy
Burton, appeals from the judgment of
the trial court vesting permanent custody
with the Commissioner of Agriculture,
through the Department of Agriculture
(department), of sixty-five goats owned by
the defendant and from the judgment of
the court dismissing the defendant's counterclaim
against the plaintiff, the state of
Connecticut. On appeal, the defendant
raises a number of claims, which we distill
to the following: (1) the court lacked jurisdiction
over the verified petition filed by
Jeremiah Dunn, the chief animal control
officer of the plaintiff, to vest temporary
custody of the goats with the department,
(2) the court improperly denied her motion
to suppress, which attacked the process by
which the warrant to search her property
and seize the goats was issued pursuant to
General Statutes (Supp. 2022) &sect; 22-329a
(b),<fnr1> (3) she was "denied due process when
she was not allowed to present [her] motion
to suppress for adjudication," (4) she
was entitled to notice and a hearing prior
to the seizure of her goats
<SPage 270>
pursuant to
General Statutes &sect; 19a-341,<fnr2> (5) the court
improperly determined that the goats were
subjected to neglect and cruel treatment,
(6) the court improperly determined that
the defendant failed to comply with its
order to relinquish ownership of the goats
by April 16, 2021, or pay a surety or cash
bond in the amount of $32,000 by that
date, (7) &sect; 22-329a is unconstitutional on its
face and as applied in this case, and (8) the
court improperly dismissed the defendant's
counterclaim on the ground that the claims
raised in the counterclaim were barred by
either sovereign immunity or the prior
pending action doctrine. We affirm the
judgments of the court.
<Page 989>

<P20>The following facts, as set forth in the
record or the trial court's memorandum of
decision vesting temporary custody of the
goats with the department, and procedural
history are relevant to this appeal. At all
relevant times, the defendant was the owner
of real property located at 147 Cross
Highway in Redding (property), on which
she kept a herd of goats. The Redding
Police Department (police department)
had received at least 120 complaints regarding
the goats kept on the property,
most of which related to roaming goats
and violations of town ordinances. In April,
2020, one of the goats was in the road and
was struck by a motor vehicle.<fnr3> The department,
as well, received at least five
complaints regarding the goats, most of
which concerned their care and condition.
On or about October 7, 2020, the state
animal control unit received a complaint
concerning injured and/or neglected goats
kept on the property. Following that complaint,
on October 15, 2020, Barbara Godejohn,
a state animal
<SPage 271>
control officer,
along with Redding Police Detective
Christina Dias, observed approximately fifty
goats on the property, one of which
appeared to be walking on its knees and
unable to stand. Subsequently, Charles
DellaRocco, a state animal control officer,
was assigned to investigate a complaint
made by the defendant and, on December
10, 2020, he went to the property. Although
the defendant did not allow DellaRocco
onto the property, DellaRocco was
able to observe thirty-five to forty-five
goats from a distance, one of which was
visibly limping. On February 3, 2021, DellaRocco
observed the goats from a nearby
location, where he viewed the defendant as
she provided a minimal amount of hay to a
goat paddock containing ten goats. On the
basis of DellaRocco's observations of the
goats on February 3, 2021, the department
decided to conduct further surveillance of
the property for the purpose of determining
the condition of the herd. That surveillance,
which concluded on March 4, 2021,
resulted in a number of animal health and
property management concerns, including
that the goats were not given enough food
and fresh water, they were not provided
with adequate shelters from the elements,
the existing shelters were in disrepair, either
missing walls or a roof, and the goats
were living in unsanitary conditions as a
result of manure piling up several feet
high. The goats themselves appeared to be
in poor condition as well, with some having
overgrown hooves, which affected their
gait and mobility.

<P20>As a result of these concerns, Dunn filed
an application for a search and seizure
warrant pursuant to &sect; 22-329a (b) to seize
the goats. The warrant application was
accompanied by an affidavit from DellaRocco,
who attested, on the basis of his
observations, that the goats were being
treated cruelly.<fnr4> The court granted the
application and issued the warrant on
March 9, 2021, finding
<SPage 272>
that there was
probable cause that the goats were neglected
or cruelly treated. The following
day, the warrant was executed, and the
department took custody of sixty-five live
goats and one dead goat from the property.
Furthermore, members of the department
who were present during the execution
of the warrant discovered between
forty and fifty dead goats, in various
stages of decomposition, in multiple locations
throughout the property. Thereafter,
Dunn filed a verified petition seeking, inter
alia, temporary custody of the goats and
requesting the court to issue an order to
<Page 990>
the defendant to show cause why the court
should not vest custody of the goats in the
department.<fnr5> The court granted that request,
issued a show cause order to the
defendant and ordered a remote hearing to
be held on March 30, 2021. The court held
an evidentiary hearing on the verified petition
for temporary custody on March 30
and April 8, 2021. Thereafter, the court,
<EM>Cobb, J.,</EM> granted the petition in part and
ordered, inter alia, that "[t]emporary care
and custody of the sixty-four live goats
seized by the [plaintiff] ... shall continue
to be vested in the [plaintiff]...."

<P20>In its memorandum of decision relating
to the plaintiff's request seeking an order
of temporary custody of the sixty-five
goats seized from the property, the court
made the following findings: "The defendant
is the owner of the property located
at 147 Cross Highway,
<SPage 273>
Redding ... and
sixty-five live goats that lived on the property
prior to March 10, 2021, when the
animals were seized by the [plaintiff]. The
defendant had owned other goats that died
on the property. Forty to fifty goats were
found dead and decaying on the property,
with some of the carcasses found decaying
in black plastic bags and Rubbermaid plastic
bins. In October, 2020, the defendant
voluntarily transferred twenty-three live
goats from her property and placed them
at an animal rescue facility.

<P20>"The defendant neglected the goats and
treated them cruelly in a number of ways,
including: (1) The defendant did not properly
maintain the hooves of many of the
goats, allowing the hooves to grow too long
which impacted their mobility.

<P20>"(2) The defendant did not maintain the
property or the shelters in that she did not
remove manure that accumulated on the
property and inside the shelters. Certain
of the shelters had manure piled up to a
foot high. The buildup of the manure in the
shelters limited the space available in the
shelters for the goats and impeded the
goats' ability to use them. The manure was
also a hazard to the goats' health and
safety.

<P20>"(3) Many of the goats seized by the
[plaintiff] had manure caked into their fur
and were missing significant areas of fur
on their coats.

<P20>"(4) The defendant failed to provide the
goats with adequate food or water. Many
of the goats were underweight. Also, photographs
depict many empty and dry food
and water containers on the property. Certain
of the buckets appeared to have had
water in them but the water had frozen
due to the freezing temperatures. When
state investigators conducted a surveillance
of the property over a two day period,
one noted she did not see the defendant
provide any food or water at any
time.
<SPage 274>

<P20>"(5) When the defendant did provide
water to the goats, she did not use a hose
system, but rather purchased plastic gallon
water bottles. The amount of water provided
to the goats from these water bottles
was insufficient. Also, the defendant then
allowed empty plastic water bottles to be
left around the property, where the goats
had access and could chew on them.
<Page 991>

<P20>"(6) The defendant did not provide the
goats with proper or adequate shelter. The
number of shelters located on the property
[was] limited and sufficient to accommodate
only about thirty-five goats, not the
sixty-five goats living on the property. In
addition, the shelters were decrepit with
missing walls and parts of ceilings. As a
result, many of the shelters failed to provide
proper protection for the animals
from the rain, snow, cold, wind and other
inclement weather.

<P20>"(7) The defendant allowed the property
to be riddled with numerous dead and
decaying goats.

<P20>"(8) The defendant allowed at least one
goat to die on the property without proper
care or treatment nor did she provide the
goat with a proper or humane death. On
March 10, the [plaintiff] found a recently
deceased goat lying on the floor of a shelter
used by the live goats. There was
evidence that the deceased goat had fallen
and could not get up and had been scraping
his legs against the floor of the shelter
prior to its death. Parts of that dead goat's
body had been eaten by rodents or other
vermin.

<P20>"Since the goats were seized by the
[plaintiff] on March 10, 2021, and have
been in the [department's] custody, one
goat has died and six kids have been born,
putting the number of goats in the [department's]
care at seventy. When the six kids
were born, their birthweights were unusually
low, and all needed human intervention
to survive.
<SPage 275>

<P20>"The court finds that while in the
defendant's care, the sixty-five goats were
in imminent harm and were neglected and
cruelly treated by the defendant. The
court, therefore, determines that the
[plaintiff] has met its burden to establish
reasonable cause to find that the animals'
condition and the circumstances surrounding
their care by the defendant require
that temporary care and custody continue
to be assumed by the [plaintiff] to safeguard
the goats' welfare."

<P20>The court, therefore, vested temporary
care and custody of the sixty-four live
goats seized and the newly born kids in
the department. The court also ordered
that the defendant, "[o]n or before April
16, 2021 ... relinquish ownership of the
animals to the [plaintiff] or post a surety
or cash bond with the [department] in the
amount of [$500] per each of the sixty-four
remaining live goats seized by the [plaintiff]
to pay for the reasonable expenses in
caring and providing for such animals
...." The court further ordered the defendant
to "pay the expenses incurred by the
[department] in providing proper food,
shelter and care to each animal calculated
at the rate of [$15] per goat per day
beginning March 11, 2021, and continuing
until the goats are returned to the defendant,
the defendant relinquishes custody of
the goats or permanent custody of the
goats is vested in the [department] ...
[and] ... pay all veterinary costs and expenses
incurred for the welfare of the animals,
which costs are not covered in the
per diem rate during the period the goats
remain in the [department's] temporary
care and possession."

<P20>On April 20, 2021, the plaintiff filed a
motion for an order requesting that the
court vest permanent custody of the goats
in the department. The basis for the motion
was the defendant's failure to post a
bond or to voluntarily relinquish ownership
of the goats, as ordered by the court on
April 9, 2021, and as required by &sect; 22-329a
<SPage 276>
(f).<fnr6> In its motion, the plaintiff asserted:
<Page 992>
"Pursuant to the order of the court, the
defendant was given a choice of posting a
bond, in order to protect the plaintiff from
the increasing expense of caring for her
goats during the pendency of these proceedings,
or relinquishing ownership over
them. The order unambiguously required
the defendant to choose. The court required
the defendant to post a surety or
cash bond in the amount of $32,000 ($500
per animal). The defendant has refused to
comply with the order of the court. Instead,
the defendant sent a check to the
plaintiff in the amount of $450 and has
attempted to unilaterally modify the order
to her benefit. Notably, the defendant's
attempt to ignore the order is based, in
part, on her desire to proceed only to
oppose the [plaintiff's] efforts to obtain
ownership over nine specifically identified
goats. By any metric, the defendant has
wilfully defied the order of the court by
failing to post the bond as required by the
court or [to] relinquish ownership over the
goats. As a result of the defendant's refusal
to comply with the court's order, ownership
must be vested in the [department]."
The defendant filed an objection to the
plaintiff's motion for an order on April 27,
2022.

<P20>On May 4, 2022, the court granted the
plaintiff's motion for an order. In its written
order, the court, <EM>Bellis, J.,</EM>
<SPage 277>
stated:
"The clear and unambiguous order of the
court ... on April 9, 2021, required the
defendant to either relinquish control of
the goats to the [plaintiff] or post surety or
cash bond with the [department] in the
amount of [$500] for each of the sixty-four
remaining live goats no later than April 16,
2021. While the defendant filed a motion to
`Relinquish Ownership of Goats for Immediate
Release to Qualified Animal Rescue
Sanctuaries' on the April 16, 2021 deadline,
that motion, which was subsequently denied,
was an offer to relinquish ownership
of the goats to two animal sanctuaries and
various private individuals of the defendant's
own choosing. Simply put, it was <EM>not</EM>
an offer to relinquish control of the goats
to the [plaintiff]. As such, the defendant
did not relinquish control of the goats to
the [plaintiff] by the April 16, 2021 court
deadline. Therefore, the sole issue for the
court is whether the defendant posted
surety or cash bond with the [department]
in the amount of [$500] for each of the
sixty-four remaining live goats. The total
amount due, on or before April 16, 2021,
pursuant to the court's order, was $32,000.
The defendant makes no claim that the
$32,000 was paid. The court rejects the
defendant's argument that the [plaintiff]
waived the $32,000 based on her claim that
the [plaintiff] had done so in the past in
other matters. There is neither argument
nor evidence in this case that the [plaintiff]
has waived the surety or cash bond, but,
more importantly, the imposition of the
surety or cash bond was a binding order of
the court [that] the parties were required
to comply with. For these reasons, the
motion of the [plaintiff] is granted. Permanent
ownership of all of the defendant's
goats and their offspring, born and unborn,
is vested in the [department]. Additionally,
pursuant to ... &sect; 22-329a (h), the
sum of $39,360 ($15/day for forty-one days
<Page 993>
of care for sixty-four goats) plus any veterinary
costs not covered by the per diem
rate associated with the care of the goats
for that forty-one
<SPage 278>
day time period shall
be paid by the defendant to the [department]."
(Emphasis in original.)

<P20>Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a motion
for judgment in accordance with the
court's May 4, 2022 order. On June 22,
2022, the court, <EM>Bellis, J.,</EM> granted the
motion and rendered judgment for the
plaintiff with respect to its action against
the defendant but noted that a counterclaim
filed by the defendant remained
pending. The defendant appealed to this
court from the June 22, 2022 judgment in
favor of the plaintiff. Thereafter, the court,
<EM>Bellis, J.,</EM> granted a motion to dismiss the
counterclaim filed by the plaintiff following
argument on the motion, and the defendant
filed an amended appeal with this
court challenging the judgment dismissing
her counterclaim. Additional facts and procedural
history will be set forth as necessary.

<CN>I

<P20>We first address the defendant's
claim that the court lacked jurisdiction
over the verified petition to vest temporary
custody of the goats with the department.
The defendant bases this claim on
her assertion that, because the verified
petition fails to identify the goats individually
and to "plainly state" facts pertaining
to the neglect and cruel treatment with
regard to each goat seized, the goats were
never brought within the jurisdiction of
the court as a result of this alleged deficiency
in the verified petition. Thus, according
to the defendant, the court lacked
jurisdiction over this case pursuant to the
governing statute, &sect; 22-329a (c). The plaintiff,
on the other hand, counters that this
claim, which concerns the sufficiency of the
verified petition, does not implicate the
subject matter jurisdiction of the court.
We conclude that, even if we assume, without
deciding, that the claim implicates the
court's jurisdiction over the matter, the
claim nonetheless fails, as
<SPage 279>
the verified
complaint sufficiently complied with the
requirements of the statute.

<P20>We first set forth our standard of
review for this claim. The defendant's
claim "presents a question of statutory
construction over which we exercise plenary
review.... When construing a statute,
[o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain
and give effect to the apparent intent of
the legislature.... In other words, we
seek to determine, in a reasoned manner,
the meaning of the statutory language as
applied to the facts of [the] case, including
the question of whether the language actually
does apply.... The meaning of a statute
shall, in the first instance, be ascertained
from the text of the statute itself
and its relationship to other statutes. If,
after examining such text and considering
such relationship, the meaning of such text
is plain and unambiguous and does not
yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual
evidence of the meaning of the
statute shall not be considered. General
Statutes &sect; 1-2z.... [A] statute is plain and
unambiguous when the meaning ... is so
strongly indicated or suggested by the
[statutory] language ... that ... it appears
to be <EM>the</EM> meaning and appears to
preclude any other likely meaning.... [I]f
the text of the statute at issue ... would
permit more than one likely or plausible
meaning, its meaning cannot be said to be
plain and unambiguous." (Citations omitted;
emphasis in original; internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Demarco</EM> v. <EM>Charter
Oak Temple Restoration Assn., Inc.,</EM> 226
Conn. App. 335, 339-40, 317 A.3d 1137,
cert. denied, 349 Conn. 923, 321 A.3d 1130
(2024). "It is a basic tenet of statutory
construction that [w]e construe a statute
as a whole and read its subsections concurrently
in order to reach a reasonable overall
<Page 994>
interpretation." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Townsend</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 226 Conn. App. 313, 331,
317 A.3d 1147 (2024). Applying these principles
to &sect; 22-329a (c), and for the
<SPage 280>
reasons that follow, we conclude that
the defendant's interpretation of &sect; 22-329a
(c) is not consistent with the plain language
of the statute.

<P20>Section 22-329a (c) applies after the
department has taken custody of animals
and provides in relevant part that an animal
control officer "shall file with the [S]uperior
[C]ourt ... a verified petition plainly
stating such facts of neglect or cruel
treatment as to bring <EM>such animal</EM> within
the jurisdiction of the court...." (Emphasis
added.) The defendant argues that we
should construe "such animal" as used in
the statute as meaning each individual animal.
She does so, however, without citation
to any authority supporting that interpretation.<fnr7>
"Courts are not permitted to read
words into the statute that the legislature
did not insert." <EM>Dusto</EM> v. <EM>Rogers Corp.,</EM> 222
Conn. App. 71, 108, 304 A.3d 446 (2023),
cert. denied, 348 Conn. 939, 307 A.3d 274
(2024); see also <EM>Randolph</EM> v. <EM>Mambrino,</EM>
216 Conn. App. 126, 143, 284 A.3d 645
(2022) ("`[w]e will not read into a [statute]
words or limitations that are not there'").
We,
<SPage 281>
therefore, decline to read into the
statute words that are not stated therein.

<P20>Furthermore, as we have stated, the
statute must be read as a whole. Subsection
(b) of &sect; 22-329a permits any animal
control officer to take physical custody of
"<EM>any animal</EM> upon issuance of a warrant
finding probable cause that <EM>such animal</EM> is
neglected or is cruelly treated...." (Emphasis
added.) "[S]uch animal" under the
statute thus means any animal over which
the animal control officer, i.e., the department,
takes custody, which could range
from one to many animals. In the present
case, custody was taken over sixty-five
goats. It logically follows that the requirement
in subsection (c) of a plain statement
of facts of neglect and cruel treatment in
the verified petition must be made as to
the animals&mdash;the sixty-five goats&mdash;over
which the department took custody. In the
present case, the verified petition set forth
in great detail the observations of various
animal control officers during the course of
the surveillance operation that took place
prior to the seizure of the goats. Those
observations revealed health concerns related
to the goats, as well as property
management concerns, including that ten
to twelve "goats had extremely long
hooves that affected their mobility," one of
the goats appeared to be limping and unable
<Page 995>
to stand, the animals had to take
shelter in manure filled enclosures because
manure was allowed to accumulate in and
around the paddocks, "the animals [did]
not have adequate access to fresh water,"
and "the shelter provided in the paddocks
did not provide enough space to shelter all
of the animals and the shelters did not
provide an adequate wind break for high
winds and cold weather." The verified petition
further outlined the conditions of the
goats and the property following the seizure.
For example, it explained that,
"[d]uring the execution of the warrant,
dozens of dead goats, estimated to be between
forty ... and fifty ... were
<SPage 282>
discovered in multiple locations on the
property in various stages of decomposition"
and that dead goats were found in
plastic bags, inside trash containers, and in
a shallow pit that was covered by plywood.
Of the sixty-five goats that were seized,
the verified petition alleged that a number
of them were visibly underweight, had fur
that was missing, matted, or caked in mud
and manure, and had "extremely long
hooves that were not being maintained and
were affecting the mobility of the animals."

<P20>We conclude that the facts alleged
in the verified petition sufficiently
detailed the neglect and cruel treatment of
the goats so as to comply with the terms of
&sect; 22-329a (c). The clear and unambiguous
language of the statute requires the animal
control officer to include in the verified
petition a plain statement of the facts demonstrating
neglect and cruel treatment of
"such animal" over which custody has been
taken. In the present case, sixty-five goats
were seized from the property. The verified
petition sets forth a plain statement of
the facts pertaining to the neglect and
cruel treatment of the herd of goats that
resided on the property. There is no language
in the statute requiring that the
plain statement of facts of neglect and
cruel treatment single out "each" individual
animal seized, as argued by the defendant.
Moreover, the allegations of cruel
treatment pertaining to the goats stemmed
in large part from the defendant's management
of the property. As we have stated,
the verified petition alleged that the defendant
failed to provide adequate shelter for
the goats, failed to give them sufficient
access to fresh water, and allowed the
goats to live in manure filled shelters and
with dead goats in various stages of decomposition
strewn about the property. All
of the goats on the property were being
subjected to these unsanitary conditions.
It, thus, would be nonsensical for the statute
to require that the verified petition
assert a separate
<SPage 283>
allegation as to each
individual goat when, as here, the allegations
contained therein plainly stated the
cruel treatment to which the goats, as a
herd, were being subjected. "[A] court
must construe a statute as written....
Courts may not by construction supply
omissions ... or add exceptions merely
because it appears that good reasons exist
for adding them.... The intent of the
legislature, as this court has repeatedly
observed, is to be found not in what the
legislature meant to say, but in the meaning
of what it did say.... It is axiomatic
that the court itself cannot rewrite a statute
to accomplish a particular result. That
is a function of the legislature." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Richard
P.,</EM> 179 Conn. App. 676, 688, 181 A.3d 107,
cert. denied, 328 Conn. 924, 181 A. 3d 567
(2018). The defendant's claim, therefore, is
unavailing.

<CN>II

<P20>The defendant next challenges
the court's denial of her April 8, 2021
motion to suppress,<fnr8> which attacked the
process by which the warrant to search
her property and seize the goats was issued
<Page 996>
pursuant to &sect; 22-329a (b). In her
motion, the defendant alleged that the
warrant was "procured under false pretenses"
by DellaRocco, that his affirmations
under oath to procure the warrant
were "highly suspect," and that his affidavit
was "replete with false, fanciful and
ridiculous" assertions that were made
recklessly and that did not establish probable
cause. The defendant sought a new
probable cause hearing, the warrant
"stricken," and the goats returned. On appeal,
the defendant reiterates her assertions
that DellaRocco lacked credibility
and that the warrant failed to establish
probable cause. She now argues for the
first time that (1) DellaRocco lacked credibility
because he wilfully withheld facts,
namely, that he failed to disclose a prior
arrest on felony charges
<SPage 284>
of larceny and
forgery, and that such facts, if known,
"would have doomed the [warrant] application";
and (2) the trial judge who made the
finding of probable cause to issue the warrant
had a conflict of interest. Because
these arguments were not raised in the
defendant's motion to suppress<fnr9> and are
being raised for the first time on appeal,
we decline to review them.<fnr10> See <EM>Deutsche
Bank Trust Co. Americas</EM> v. <EM>Burke,</EM> 218
Conn.
<SPage 285>
App. 542, 546 n.4, 292 A.3d 81
(declining to review claim raised for first
time on appeal), cert. denied, 347 Conn.
904, 297 A.3d 567 (2023). Moreover, with
respect to her claim that DellaRocco's allegations
in his affidavit in support of the
warrant lacked credibility and did not establish
probable cause, the defendant
<Page 997>
makes conclusory assertions without any
citation to authority or analysis of the law
as applied to this case. "Where the parties
cite no law and provide no analysis of their
claims, we do not review such claims."

A.3d 107 (2014). "We repeatedly have stated
that [w]e are not required to review
issues that have been improperly presented
to this court through an inadequate
brief.... Analysis, rather than mere abstract
assertion, is required in order to
avoid abandoning an issue by failure to
brief the issue properly." (Internal quotation

briefed her challenge to the denial
of her motion to suppress, we decline to
review this claim.<fnr11>
<Page 998>

<CN>III
<SPage 286>

<P20>The defendant next claims that
she was "denied due process when she was
not allowed to present [her] motion to
suppress for adjudication." We disagree.

<P20>The following additional facts and procedural
history are relevant to this claim. At
the end of the day of the
<SPage 287>
hearing on
March 30, 2021, concerning the plaintiff's
verified petition, the plaintiff's counsel requested
that the court issue an order for
temporary custody, which he argued would
trigger subsection (f) of &sect; 22-329a and
allow for the remainder of the hearing to
address a permanent order for custody of
the goats. The court declined to issue any
order at that time. On April 8, 2021, at the
outset of the second day of the hearing,
the court referred to the conversation from
the previous day concerning the issue of
whether the hearing should be for a permanent
or temporary order. The court
stated that it believed that the statute
called for a two step process, that is, the
court first had to determine whether a
temporary order of custody was necessary
and then, if necessary, it could address
permanency at a separate proceeding.
Both counsel for the plaintiff and the defendant
initially agreed with the court proceeding
that way and focusing the hearing
on whether an order of temporary custody
was warranted. Thereafter, the defendant
notified the court that she had filed a
motion to suppress and requested that her
motion take priority over the proceedings
that day, as she believed that "it should be
considered first before anything else happen[ed]
further in th[e] case." The court
responded by stating that the proceedings
that day would be moving forward and
indicated that it would not be addressing
the defendant's motion to suppress at the
hearing that day, after which the defendant
objected to the way in which the
court was proceeding with the hearing,
arguing that her due process rights required
the court to consider her motion to
suppress before continuing with the hearing.
The court, nonetheless, overruled her
objection to moving forward on the issue of
a temporary order and stated: "With respect
to your motion to suppress, this
<SPage 288>
is
a civil proceeding, it's not a criminal proceeding.
Your motion will be taken up in
due course, but not right now. This is a
<EM>temporary</EM> proceeding, as I said before."
(Emphasis added.)

<P20>The defendant asserts in her appellate
brief that "[t]he motion was later marked
`off' ... sua sponte by [<EM>Hon. Jane S.
Scholl,</EM> judge trial referee], who had virtually
no other involvement in the case. The
motion was eventually denied without notice
or a hearing by Judge Bellis on April
13, 2022 ... a full year later. The defendant's
supplement to motion to suppress
... and motion in limine were also summarily
disposed of by denial. Thereby, <EM>the
defendant was denied the opportunity to
pursue her challenge to the warrant,</EM>
which, if successful, would have led to immediate
release of all the goats and termination
of this case and threats of excessive
monetary penalties. The court's refusal to
allow the defendant a hearing on the motion
to suppress and related motions was a
clear denial of due process." (Emphasis
added.)
<Page 999>

<P20>We next set forth general principles
governing due process claims.
"Whether a party was deprived of his [or
her] due process rights is a question of law
to which appellate courts grant plenary
review.... The core interests protected
by procedural due process concern the opportunity
to be heard at a meaningful time
and in a meaningful manner.... Fundamental
tenets of due process require that
all persons directly concerned in the result
of an adjudication be given reasonable notice
and opportunity to present their
claims or defenses.... Due process, unlike
some legal rules, is not a technical conception
with a fixed content unrelated to time,
place and circumstances.... Instead, due
process is a flexible principle that calls for
such procedural protections as the particular
situation demands." (Citations omitted;
internal quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Cameron</EM>
v. <EM>Santiago,</EM> 223 Conn. App. 836,
<SPage 289>
842-43, 310 A.3d 391 (2024). "Due process
does not mandate full evidentiary
hearings on all matters, and not all situations
calling for procedural safeguards call
for the same kind of procedure.... So
long as the procedure afforded adequately
protects the individual interests at stake,
there is no reason to impose substantially
greater burdens ... under the guise of
due process." (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) <EM>In re Sarah S.,</EM> 110 Conn. App.
576, 589 n.7, 955 A.2d 657 (2008).

<P20>Our Supreme Court has explained that
"[t]he extent to which procedural due process
must be afforded the recipient is influenced
by the extent to which he [or she]
may be condemned to suffer grievous
loss.... Whether the loss threatened by a
particular type of proceeding is sufficiently
grave to warrant more than average certainty
on the part of the factfinder turns
on both the nature of the private interest
threatened and the permanency of the
threatened loss." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>In re Juvenile Appeal (83-CD),</EM>
189 Conn. 276, 297, 455 A.2d 1313
(1983).

<P20>Under the statutory scheme of &sect; 22-329a,
if an animal has been seized pursuant
to a warrant finding probable cause
that such animal is neglected or is cruelly
treated under subsection (b), an animal
control officer must file a verified petition
plainly stating the facts of neglect or cruel
treatment. See General Statutes (Supp.
2022) &sect; 22-329a (b) and (c). Pursuant to
subsection (d) of &sect; 22-329a, "[i]f physical
custody of an animal has been taken pursuant
to subsection ... (b) ... and it
appears from the allegations of the petition
filed pursuant to subsection (c) of this section
and other affirmations of fact accompanying
the petition, or provided subsequent
thereto, that there is reasonable
cause to find that the animal's condition or
the circumstances surrounding its care require
that temporary care and custody be
immediately assumed to safeguard its welfare,
the court shall either (1) issue an
order to show
<SPage 290>
cause why the court
should not vest in some suitable state,
municipal or other public or private agency
or person the animal's temporary care and
custody pending a hearing on the petition,
or (2) issue an order vesting in some suitable
state, municipal or other public or
private agency or person the animal's temporary
care and custody pending a hearing
on the petition. A hearing on the order
issued by the court pursuant to subdivision
(1) or (2) of this subsection [(show cause
order)] shall be held not later than fourteen
days after the issuance of such order."
If, following a hearing on the show
cause order, a court vests temporary "care
and custody" of the animal "in some suitable
state, municipal or other public or
private agency or person," the owner
"shall either relinquish ownership of the
animal or post a surety bond or cash bond"
to pay for the reasonable expenses of the
agency having temporary care of the animal
until there is a final disposition pursuant
<Page 1000>
to subsection (g). General Statutes
(Supp. 2022) &sect; 22-329a (f).

<P20>Following an order of temporary custody,
&sect; 22-329a (g) (1) requires that a hearing
must be held at which it must be
demonstrated that the animal, in fact, is or
is not being neglected or cruelly treated.<fnr12>
Subsection (g) of &sect; 22-329a provides in
relevant part: "If, after hearing, the court
finds that the animal is neglected or cruelly
treated, it shall vest [permanent] ownership
of the animal" with the department or
"any state, municipal or other public or
private agency ... or ... person," but if
the court finds that the animal is not neglected
or cruelly treated, it may return
the animal to its owner. General Statutes
(Supp. 2022) &sect; 22-329a (g) (1) and (3). At
this hearing, the animal owner has an opportunity
to contest the seizure, which necessarily
<SPage 291>
includes challenging the validity
of the warrant. Thus, under the statute,
the deprivation of an animal owner's right
in a temporary custody adjudication is neither
final nor irrevocable; such order must
be followed by a hearing to determine
permanent ownership of the animal, including
consideration of whether such animal
must be returned to the owner. See
<EM>Cookson</EM> v. <EM>Cookson,</EM> 201 Conn. 229, 235,
514 A.2d 323 (1986) ("the deprivation of
rights in a <EM>temporary</EM> custody adjudication
is neither final nor irrevocable" (emphasis
added; internal quotation marks omitted)).

<P20>In the present case, the court made it
clear to the parties that it would be addressing
the verified petition in a two step
process: first, it would determine, following
the March 30 and April 8 hearings, whether
an order of temporary custody of the
goats was necessary. If it did so and issued
such an order, and if the defendant subsequently
paid the bond set by the statute
and did not relinquish ownership of her
goats, then a second hearing would be held
to address permanent custody of the goats.
Thus, when the defendant raised the issue
of her motion to suppress and the court
told her it would not be addressed at that
temporary proceeding but that it would be
"taken up in due course," the court was
indicating that it was not appropriate to
address the motion at that time, but that it
would be addressed at a future hearing.
Pursuant to &sect; 22-329a (g) (1), there would
have been a hearing on permanent custody,
provided the defendant paid the bond
as set forth in the court's order and the
statute. In the present case, however, the
defendant did not post the bond and, consequently,
a subsequent hearing on permanent
custody, at which she could have
raised her challenge to the validity of the
search warrant, never took place. On the
basis of this record, we cannot conclude
that the defendant was denied due process.
In light of the fact that the hearing on
April 8, 2021, resulted in an order
<SPage 292>
of
temporary custody of the goats, the defendant
was not denied due process as a
result of the court's failure to consider her
motion to suppress at that hearing.<fnr13> As
<Page 1001>
the court stated, the motion would be "taken
up in due course." The fact that the
motion was never ultimately "taken up" is
due to the defendant's failure to post the
bond as required by the statute and ordered
by the court, which obviated the
need for a permanent custody hearing. See
part VI B of this opinion. The defendant's
concerns about the validity of the warrant
could have been raised at a meaningful
time and in a meaningful manner had she
posted a bond for the goats following the
order vesting their temporary custody in
the department. The defendant's claim
that she was denied due process, therefore,
fails.

<CN>IV

<P20>The defendant's next claim is that
she was entitled to notice and a hearing
prior to the seizure of her goats pursuant
to &sect; 19a-341.<fnr14> Specifically, the defendant
asserts
<SPage 293>
that an investigation of her
property and the goats was conducted in
2017 and 2018 pursuant to &sect; 19a-341, which
resulted in a finding that the goats "appear[ed]
to be in good condition with food
and water available." That finding is set
forth in a 2018 investigation report by the
department that was admitted as a full
exhibit at the March 30, 2021 hearing. On
appeal, the defendant relies on that report
as "prima facie evidence that [her] goat
operation conforms with generally accepted
agricultural practices pursuant to &sect; 19a-341
...." She also argues that the plaintiff
was thus required to "overcome such prima
facie evidence at a hearing preceded by
notice before it could lawfully proceed with
the 2021 seizure...." We decline to review
this claim.

<P20>First, the defendant does not include
any citations in her appellate brief to the
record showing when she raised this claim
before the court or when it was addressed
or decided by the court. Indeed, the report
itself, on which the defendant relies in
making this claim, makes no reference to
&sect; 19a-341. Instead, the report was generated
in connection with a complaint of animal
cruelty filed against the defendant pursuant
<SPage 294>
to General Statutes &sect; 53-247 (a), and
<Page 1002>
it simply concludes that, at the end of the
investigation that occurred in <EM>2017</EM> and
<EM>2018,</EM> "all goats on the property appear[ed]
to be in good condition with food and
water available," without mentioning any
compliance with &sect; 19a-341. Moreover, at
the March 30, 2021 hearing, when the defendant
offered the report into evidence,
she made no reference to &sect; 19a-341 or to
her claim that it entitled her to a hearing
prior to the seizure of her goats; instead,
she questioned DellaRocco about the investigation
of the complaint of animal cruelty
that formed the basis of the report.
Also, on the basis of our review of the
record up to and through the temporary
custody hearing held on March 30 and
April 8, 2021, we could not find any motion
filed by the defendant claiming that she
was entitled to notice and a hearing under
&sect; 19a-341 prior to the seizure of her animals
in early March, 2021.

<P20>As our Supreme Court recently
has stated, it is the responsibility of parties,
not an appellate court, "to clearly
identify how and where in the record the
claim that the party is raising on appeal
was preserved for review and <EM>where in the
record the trial court's ruling on the claim
may be found</EM>...." (Emphasis added.)
<EM>Dur-A-Flex, Inc.</EM> v. <EM>Dy,</EM> 349 Conn. 513,
589-90, 321 A.3d 295 (2024). That is especially
true in a case such as the present
one, in which the pleadings are voluminous.
We, therefore, decline to review this
claim.

<CN>V

<P20>The defendant next challenges
the court's determination that the plaintiff
met its burden to establish that the goats
were subjected to neglect and cruel treatment
while in the defendant's care. In its
April 9, 2021 decision vesting temporary
custody of the goats with the department,
the court determined that the plaintiff met
its burden to establish "reasonable cause"
that the goats were neglected and cruelly
treated by the defendant.
<SPage 295>
In support of
her claim on appeal, the defendant first
argues that the court should have held the
plaintiff to the burden of proving its claim
by a fair preponderance of the evidence<fnr15>
but, instead, improperly applied a "minimal
standard" of reasonable cause.<fnr16> The
defendant further argues that there was
no evidence presented at the temporary
custody hearing to support a finding that
the goats were neglected or cruelly treated
and, thus, that even the lower standard of
reasonable cause was not met. We need
not decide which standard applies to an
order vesting temporary custody following
a show cause hearing<fnr17> because, even under
<Page 1003>
the higher standard of a fair preponderance
of the evidence, the defendant's
claim fails.

<P20>We begin by setting forth our
standard of review. "[T]he scope of our
appellate review depends upon the proper
characterization of the rulings made by the
trial
<SPage 296>
court. To the extent that the trial
court has made findings of fact, our review
is limited to deciding whether such findings
were clearly erroneous. When, however,
the trial court draws conclusions of law,
our review is plenary and we must decide
whether its conclusions are legally and logically
correct and find support in the facts
that appear in the record." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Walters</EM> v. <EM>Servidio,</EM>
227 Conn. App. 1, 29, 320 A.3d 1008 (2024).
When, as in the present case, the resolution
of a question of law "depends on underlying
facts that are in dispute, that
question becomes, in essence, a mixed
question of fact and law. Thus, we review
the subsidiary findings of historical fact
... for clear error, and engage in plenary
review of the trial court's application of
... legal standards ... to the underlying
historical facts." (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) <EM>ASPIC, LLC</EM> v. <EM>Poitier,</EM> 208
Conn. App. 731, 742, 267 A.3d 197 (2021).

<P20>In <EM>State ex rel. Gregan</EM> v. <EM>Koczur,</EM> 287
Conn. 145, 947 A.2d 282 (2008), our Supreme
Court addressed the issue of what
constitutes "neglect" for purposes of &sect; 22-329a.
In doing so, the court started "with
the relevant language of [General Statutes
(Rev. to 2005)] &sect; 22-329a (a): `The Chief
Animal Control Officer, any animal control
officer or any municipal or regional animal
control officer may lawfully take charge of
any animal found neglected or cruelly
treated, in violation of sections 22-366, 22-415
and 53-247 to 53-252, inclusive, and
shall thereupon proceed as provided in
subsection (b) of this section....' It is
clear from this language that &sect; 22-329a
does not contain an independent standard
of neglect but, instead, incorporates by
reference the standards of the specific
statutes enumerated therein.... [Section]
53-247 is the only statute listed in &sect; 22-329a
that applies to [the defendant's] conduct.
Accordingly, to determine what constitutes
neglect under &sect; 22-329a under the
circumstances of this case, we must look to
<SPage 297>
the language of &sect; 53-247. Section 53-247
provides in relevant part: `(a) Any person
who ... deprives of necessary sustenance
... any animal, or who, having impounded
or confined any animal, fails to give such
animal proper care or ... fails to supply
any such animal with wholesome air, food
and water, or ... having charge or custody
of any animal ... fails to provide it
with proper food, drink or protection from
the weather ... shall be fined not more
than one thousand dollars or imprisoned
not more than one year or both....' It is
reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the
neglect referred to in &sect; 22-329a includes
the failure to provide necessary sustenance,
proper care, wholesome air, food
and water under &sect; 53-247 (a)." <EM>State ex rel.
Gregan</EM> v. <EM>Koczur,</EM> supra, at 153-54, 947
A.2d 282; see also <EM>Bethlehem</EM> v. <EM>Acker,</EM> 153
Conn. App. 449, 463, 102 A.3d 107 ("[i]t is
reasonable to conclude that the neglect
referred to in &sect; 22-329a includes the failure
to provide necessary protection from
the weather"), cert. denied, 315 Conn. 908,
105 A.3d 235 (2014).

<P20>Applying the fair preponderance of the
evidence standard to the present case, and
on the basis of our careful review of the
record relating to the two day evidentiary
hearing held on March 30 and April 8,
2021, we conclude that the plaintiff presented
sufficient evidence to produce a
<Page 1004>
reasonable belief that it is more probable
or likely than not that the goats were
neglected or cruelly treated. DellaRocco
testified to the information in his investigative
report, which was admitted into evidence.
Specifically, he testified to the poor
conditions of the property observed during
the preseizure surveillance, including that
the shelters on the property were inadequate
to house the goats, filled with manure
and in a dilapidated condition with
the roof caving in on one of them. He also
testified to observing goats limping and
having issues with their hooves and with
walking, as well as to the large number of
empty plastic water
<SPage 298>
bottles on the property
and to the fact that he never saw the
defendant provide water to the goats during
his surveillance. He explained that
when the warrant was executed, he walked
the entire property and confirmed his prior
observations. He further testified that
there was not enough room for every goat
to be in a shelter.

<P20>State Animal Control Officer Tanya
Wescovich provided testimony as well regarding
a report she prepared following
the investigation of the property, which
was admitted as a full exhibit, and as to
her observations of the goats having extremely
long hooves, the excessive amount
of manure piled up in the shelters, which
caused her concern for the health of the
goats, and the large number of empty plastic
water bottles on the property to which
the goats had access. She further testified
that there were nine pregnant goats at the
time of the seizure, that five of them gave
birth to six kids in total, and that none of
the kids would have survived without human
intervention. Similar to DellaRocco's
testimony, Wescovich testified that she did
not see the defendant give water to the
goats during her surveillance shifts, during
which she observed ten to fifteen goats
that were either limping or could not move
properly. Wescovich explained that once
she gained access to the property during
the execution of the warrant, she became
aware that even more goats had issues.
Other witnesses who testified during the
two day hearing included Nancy Jarvis-Deluca,
a state animal control officer who
participated in the execution of the warrant;
Rosa Buonomo, the operator of an
animal rescue; and the defendant. In addition
to the exhibits entered into evidence
that were previously mentioned, the exhibits
before the court also included, inter
alia, numerous photographs taken on the
day of the seizure, which showed the condition
of the property, shelters and goats;
the search
<SPage 299>
warrant application and supporting
affidavit; a supplemental investigative
report submitted by Jarvis-Deluca;
and satellite images of the property.

<P20>The documentary and testimonial evidence
presented shows that the defendant
failed to provide the goats with adequate
shelter, both in terms of space to shelter
all the goats and for protection from high
winds and cold weather; failed to give
them sufficient access to fresh water;
failed to properly care for the goats'
hooves by letting them become overgrown,
which affected the mobility of the goats;
and allowed the goats to live in unsanitary
conditions with manure filled shelters and
with dead goats in various stages of decomposition
strewn about the property.
That evidence was sufficient to demonstrate
that it is more probable than not
that the goats were not provided with
proper care, drink and protection from the
weather to establish neglect for purposes
of &sect; 22-329a. See <EM>State ex rel. Gregan</EM> v.
<EM>Koczur,</EM> supra, 287 Conn. at 153-54, 947
A.2d 282;<fnr18> <EM>Bethlehem</EM> v. <EM>Acker,</EM> supra, 153
<Page 1005>
Conn. App. at 463, 102 A.3d 107. In her
appellate brief, the defendant focuses
much of her challenge to the court's finding
of neglect on the fact that her goats
were not identified to have any serious
medical conditions and did not appear to
be dehydrated so as to warrant their seizure.
This court has determined previously,
however,
<SPage 300>
that "[n]owhere does our
statutory, regulatory, or common-law
scheme require an animal to be suffering
from a present illness as a prerequisite to
finding that the animal is neglected." <EM>Bethlehem</EM>
v. <EM>Acker,</EM> supra, at 467 n.12, 102
A.3d 107. Moreover, this claim ignores the
court's factual findings that the goats not
only endured extreme cruelty and neglectful
conditions, but as many as forty to fifty
of them died in the defendant's care as
well.

<P20>We conclude that the plaintiff established
that it is more probable than not
that the goats were neglected or cruelly
treated.<fnr19> The defendant, therefore, has
failed to demonstrate that the court incorrectly
concluded that temporary custody of
the goats should vest with the department.

<CN>VI

<P20>The defendant's next two claims concern
the court's April 9, 2021 order that, "[o]n
or before April 16, 2021, the defendant
shall relinquish ownership of the animals
to the [plaintiff] or post a surety or cash
bond with the [department] in the amount
of [$500] per each of the sixty-four remaining
live goats seized by the [plaintiff] to
pay for the reasonable expenses in caring
and providing for such animals...." With
respect to this order, the defendant claims
that (1) she complied with the order to the
extent that it required relinquishment of
the goats by April 16, 2021, and (2) she
complied with the bond requirement of the
order. We disagree with both claims and
address them in turn.

<CN>A

<P20>The defendant first asserts that
she complied with the order regarding relinquishment
by filing a motion
<SPage 301>
on April
16, 2021, in which she sought to "relinquish
ownership of [her] goats for immediate
release to qualified animal rescue facilities
and individuals as identified by the defendant"
(motion to relinquish). In connection
with this claim, the defendant also appears
to be arguing that the court did not issue a
ruling in a timely manner and, ultimately,
improperly denied her motion. We are not
persuaded.

<P20>After the court issued its April 9, 2021
order requiring the defendant, by April 16,
2021, either to relinquish ownership of the
goats to the plaintiff or to post a surety or
cash bond in the amount ordered, the defendant,
instead, filed her motion to relinquish.
Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion
for an order requesting that the court
vest permanent custody of the goats in the
department as a result of the defendant's
failure to relinquish ownership of the goats
<Page 1006>
or to post a bond, as required by &sect; 22-329a
(f). In its written order granting the plaintiff's
motion and vesting permanent custody
of the goats with the department, the
court stated that the language of its prior
order was clear and unambiguous and "required
the defendant to either relinquish
control of the goats to the [plaintiff] or
post surety or cash bond with the [department]
in the amount of [$500] for each of
the sixty-four remaining live goats, no later
than April 16, 2021." The court further
stated that the defendant's motion to relinquish
"was <EM>not</EM> an offer to relinquish control
of the goats to the [plaintiff]. As such,
the defendant did not relinquish control of
the goats to the [plaintiff] by the April 16,
2021 court deadline." (Emphasis in original.)
The defendant's claim, therefore, appears
to be challenging the court's finding,
made in its order vesting permanent custody
of the goats with the department, that
the defendant had not complied with its
April 9, 2021 order regarding relinquishment
of the goats. That raises an issue of
fact, which we review under the clearly
erroneous standard of review. See
<SPage 302>
<EM>Meineke Bristol, LLC</EM> v. <EM>Premier Auto,
LLC,</EM> 227 Conn. App. 64, 73, 319 A.3d 826
(2024) ("A finding of fact is clearly erroneous
when there is no evidence in the record
to support it ... or when although
there is evidence to support it, the reviewing
court on the entire evidence is left with
the definite and firm conviction that a mistake
has been committed.... Our authority,
when reviewing the findings of a judge,
is circumscribed by the deference we must
give to decisions of the trier of fact, who is
usually in a superior position to appraise
and weigh the evidence.... The question
for this court ... is not whether it would
have made the findings the trial court did,
but whether in view of the evidence and
pleadings in the whole record it is left with
the definite and firm conviction that a mistake
has been committed." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.)).

<P20>The court's April 9, 2021 order,
which tracked the language of &sect; 22-329a
(f), gave the defendant the choice between
two options to be completed by April 16,
2021, namely, relinquish ownership of the
goats to the plaintiff or post a surety or
cash bond in the amount ordered. We
agree with the court that filing a motion
was not a proper response to the court's
order. Moreover, the court was correct in
finding that the motion to relinquish "was
<EM>not</EM> an offer to relinquish control of the
goats to the [<EM>plaintiff</EM>]." (Emphasis altered.)
Rather, as the defendant states in
her appellate brief, "[t]he motion [sought]
to relinquish the goats with the single
qualification that they be rehomed to facilities
and individuals selected by the defendant."
The addition of that qualification by
the defendant, however, is contrary to the
general rule that "[a]n order of the court
must be obeyed until it has been modified
or successfully challenged." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Celini</EM> v. <EM>Celini,</EM> 115
Conn. App. 371, 382, 973 A.2d 664 (2009);
see also <EM>Eldridge</EM> v. <EM>Eldridge,</EM> 244 Conn.
523, 530, 710 A.2d 757
<SPage 303>
(1998). In the
present case, the defendant is improperly
attempting, unilaterally, to modify the requirement
of the court's order that she
relinquish ownership of the goats to the
<EM>plaintiff</EM> by adding the qualification that
the goats be rehomed to a facility or individual
of her choosing, which she cannot
do, regardless of whether she believes any
particular animal rescue is a more suitable
environment for the goats. There is nothing
in the statutory scheme governing the
welfare of animals that allows the owner of
a seized animal to decide or direct where a
seized animal must go following a finding
of neglect or cruel treatment of the animal.
The court's finding that the defendant did
not relinquish ownership of the goats by
April 16, 2021, is supported by the record
and is not clearly erroneous.
<Page 1007>

<P20>To the extent that the defendant
claims on appeal that the court did
not decide her motion to relinquish in a
timely manner and then improperly denied
it, we conclude that such claims are inadequately
briefed. The defendant has not
cited any authority demonstrating that
there was a time period in which the motion
had to be decided or why the court's
ultimate denial of the motion was improper.<fnr20>
"[F]or this court judiciously and
<SPage 304>
efficiently to consider claims of error
raised on appeal ... the parties must
clearly and fully set forth their arguments
in their briefs.... The parties may not
merely cite a legal principle without analyzing
the relationship between the facts of
the case and the law cited.... <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>Buhl,</EM> 321 Conn. 688, 724, 138 A.3d 868
(2016). Claims are inadequately briefed
when they are merely mentioned and not
briefed beyond a bare assertion....
Claims are also inadequately briefed when
they ... consist of conclusory assertions
... with no mention of relevant authority

<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Roberts,</EM> 227 Conn. App. 159,
185-86, 320 A.3d 989 (2024). The defendant's
brief is devoid of citations to authority
to support her assertions. Consequently,
we decline to review these claims.

<CN>B

<P20>Next, the defendant claims that
the court improperly determined that she
failed to pay the bond ordered by the court
pursuant to &sect; 22-329a (f) within the deadline
set by the court. Specifically, she argues
that she complied with the order
regarding the bond when she submitted a
bank check to the plaintiff's counsel by the
deadline in the amount of $450 along with
a letter, which identified nine goats. The
defendant subsequently submitted payments
totaling $5070, which she claims is a
sufficient amount for ten of the goats. Our
resolution of this claim requires little discussion.

<P20>As we stated, the court's April 9, 2021
order provided the defendant with two options:
relinquish ownership of the goats or
pay a bond as set by the court. With
respect to the bond issue, the court stated:
"The total amount due, on or before April
16, 2021, pursuant to the court's order, was
$32,000. The defendant makes no claim
that the $32,000 was paid." There is no
dispute in the record that the defendant
did not pay the required
<SPage 305>
amount by the
April 16 deadline. On appeal, she argues
first that she was not required to pay the
bond because she relinquished ownership
of the goats by way of her motion to
relinquish. We already have rejected that
<Page 1008>
claim. Because the defendant did not relinquish
ownership of the goats, she was required
to pay the $32,000 bond by April 16,
2021, which she failed to do. The defendant
also makes a number of arguments about
how the deadline to pay the bond was
extended, by which point she had made
incremental deposits totaling more than
$4500, which she claimed was sufficient to
secure more than nine goats. The order,
however, did not give the defendant the
option to pay a bond in an amount that
would cover only nine goats, beyond the
deadline. Even if we were to agree, without
deciding, that the deadline had been
extended, the defendant never paid the
required amount of the bond. Her claim,
therefore, fails.<fnr21>

<CN>VII

<P20>The defendant next claims that
&sect; 22-329a is unconstitutional on its face
and as applied in this case. We decline to
review this claim due to inadequate briefing.

<P20>We begin by noting that, in her
principal appellate brief, the defendant
states that she challenged the constitutionality
of &sect; 22-329a by motion, which was
denied. She then states: "The defendant
asserts the unconstitutionality of the statute
facially and as applied to her on appeal
by incorporating the argument previously
presented and presenting additional issues
herein." Our rules of practice contain page
and word limits for appellate briefs. See
Practice Book &sect;&sect; 67-3 and 67-3A. The defendant
cannot sidestep those requirements
by directing
<SPage 306>
us in her appellate
brief to arguments in support of her claim
that are raised in another document. See
<EM>Robb</EM> v. <EM>Connecticut Board of Veterinary
Medicine,</EM> 204 Conn. App. 595, 612, 254
A.3d 915 (2021) ("The plaintiff's attempt to
incorporate by reference his amended verified
complaint into his principal appellate
brief is not procedurally proper. As is apparent
in this case, permitting legal claims
to be incorporated by reference into an
appellate brief would, among other things,
enable litigants to circumvent the page
limitations set forth in Practice Book &sect; 67-3.
See, e.g., <EM>Papic</EM> v. <EM>Burke,</EM> 113 Conn.
App. 198, 217 n.11, 965 A.2d 633 (2009) (`it
is not permissible to use [an] appendix [to
an appellate brief] either to set forth argument
or to evade the thirty-five page limitation
provided in Practice Book &sect; 67-3
and already met by the [appellant's]
brief')." (Footnote omitted.)), cert. denied,
338 Conn. 911, 259 A.3d 654 (2021).

<P20>In her principal appellate brief, the defendant
argues that &sect; 22-329a is unconstitutional
on its face, stating that "[t]he statute
suffers from constitutional defects in
addition to those cited ... in her motion"
and listing the alleged defects. According
to the defendant, the statute, on its face
and as applied, denies "fundamental freedoms
and protections from abusive conduct
by the state in violation of the first,
fourth, eighth and fourteenth amendments."

<P20>In her appellate brief, the defendant
devotes a few sentences to a short
paragraph to each of these claimed
grounds challenging the statute's constitutionality,
with no citation to authority. She
also fails to include any relevant law concerning
what must be shown to establish
that a statute is unconstitutional on its face
or as applied. In all, the defendant devotes
three pages of her appellate brief to her
challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 22-329a
on all of these grounds and pursuant
to the first, fourth, eighth and fourteenth
amendments to the federal constitution. As
<Page 1009>
our Supreme Court has
<SPage 307>
cautioned, "[a]lthough
the number of pages devoted to an
argument in a brief is not necessarily determinative,
relative sparsity weighs in favor
of concluding that the argument has
been inadequately briefed. This is especially
so with regard to first amendment and
other constitutional claims, which are often
analytically complex. See, e.g., <EM>Schleifer</EM> v.
<EM>Charlottesville,</EM> 159 F.3d 843, 871-72 (4th
Cir. 1998) (`[f]irst [a]mendment jurisprudence
is a vast and complicated body of
law that grows with each passing day' and
involves `complicated and nuanced constitutional
concepts'), cert. denied, 526 U.S.
1018, 119 S. Ct. 1252, 143 L. Ed. 2d 349
(1999); <EM>Missouri</EM> v. <EM>National Organization
for Women, Inc.,</EM> 620 F.2d 1301, 1326 (8th
Cir.) (first amendment issues are `complex'),
cert. denied, 449 U.S. 842, 101 S. Ct.
122, 66 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1980); see also <EM>In re
Melody L.,</EM> 290 Conn. 131, 154-55, 962
A.2d 81 (2009) (one and one-half page
equal protection claim was inadequate),
overruled on other grounds by <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>Elson,</EM> 311 Conn. 726, 746-47, 91 A.3d 862
(2014); <EM>Connecticut Light & Power Co.</EM> v.
<EM>Dept. of Public Utility Control,</EM> [266 Conn.
108, 120, 830 A.2d 1121 (2003)] (claim under
takings clause was inadequately
briefed when plaintiff provided `no authority
or analysis in support of its specific
claim'); <EM>In re Shyliesh H.,</EM> 56 Conn. App.
167, 181, 743 A.2d 165 (1999) (attempt to
brief two constitutional claims in two and
one-half pages was inadequate)." <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>Buhl,</EM> supra, 321 Conn. at 726, 138 A.3d
868. We conclude that the defendant has
not adequately briefed her claim challenging
the constitutionality of &sect; 22-329a, both
on its face and as applied to her. Therefore,
we decline to review this claim.

<CN>VIII

<P20>The defendant's last claim is that the
court improperly dismissed her counterclaim.
We are not persuaded.

<P20>The following additional facts are relevant
to our resolution of this claim. In her
counterclaim dated May
<SPage 308>
3, 2022, the
defendant made a number of claims, which
can be summarized as follows: (1) the defendant's
fourth amendment rights were
violated because the affidavit submitted by
DellaRocco in support of the search warrant
omitted material facts and contained
false statements and because the verified
petition did not plainly state the facts of
neglect and cruel treatment as required by
&sect; 22-329a (c); (2) the department violated
&sect; 22-329a (i) by allowing favored individuals
priority to adopt the goats; (3) the
department violated the defendant's due
process rights by providing false testimony
at the hearing before Judge Cobb held on
March 30 and April 8, 2021; (4) the defendant's
first amendment rights were violated
by the commencement of these proceedings
in retaliation for the defendant's
speech; and (5) &sect; 22-329a is unconstitutional
on its face and as applied to the defendant
and infringes on the defendant's first
amendment rights. The relief sought in the
counterclaim included the "return of the
goats, a declaratory judgment that &sect; 22-329a
is unconstitutional, and the extinguishment
of all demands for bonds or
other monetary payments." The plaintiff
moved to dismiss the counterclaim on four
grounds, namely, that the counterclaim
was (1) barred by sovereign immunity, (2)
barred by the prior pending action doctrine,
(3) untimely and (4) not properly
brought in this in rem proceeding. The
court based its decision dismissing the
counterclaim on the grounds of sovereign
immunity and the prior pending action
doctrine. We therefore limit our discussion
regarding this claim to those two grounds
and address them in turn.

<CN>A

<P20>The court granted the motion to
dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity
only with respect to three of the five
<Page 1010>
claims asserted in the counterclaim.<fnr22> The
<SPage 309>
court concluded that the three claims
did not allege sufficient facts to bypass
sovereign immunity or to show that an
exception to the state's sovereign immunity
applied, in that the claims failed to set
forth a substantial claim that the defendant's
constitutional rights were violated.

<P20>The defendant's briefing on
this issue consists of three short paragraphs.
She first appears to suggest that,
because the trial court declined to grant
the motion to dismiss on the basis of sovereign
immunity as to two of the grounds
raised in the counterclaim, sovereign immunity
did not justify dismissal of the
other three grounds in the counterclaim.
Next, the defendant asserts that dismissal
of the counterclaim should have been
raised, if at all, by way of a motion to
strike, rather than a motion to dismiss,
because, according to the defendant, the
issues raised in the motion to dismiss concerned
the sufficiency of the allegations
pursuant to Practice Book &sect; 10-39, not the
jurisdiction of the court. See Practice Book
&sect; 10-30. Aside from referencing those two
rules of practice, the defendant provided
no other citation to authority to support
her assertions, and her brief lacks any
analysis of applicable law concerning sovereign
immunity or any exceptions thereto,
including how any exception to the state's
sovereign immunity applies to her claims.<fnr23>
<Page 1011>
As we have stated
<SPage 310>
previously in this
opinion, "[c]laims are ... inadequately
briefed when they ... consist of conclusory
assertions ... with no mention of relevant
authority and minimal or no citations
from the record"; (internal quotation
marks omitted) <EM>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.</EM> v.
<EM>Caldrello,</EM> 192 Conn. App. 1, 35, 219 A.3d
858, cert. denied, 334 Conn. 905, 220 A.3d
37 (2019); and "parties may not merely cite
a legal principle without analyzing the relationship
between the facts of the case
and the law cited." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Vaccaro</EM> v. <EM>D'Angelo,</EM> 184
Conn. App. 467, 488, 195 A.3d 443 (2018).
In the present case, the defendant's brief
on this issue contains no meaningful analysis
of how the court's dismissal of a portion
of the counterclaim on the ground of sovereign
immunity was improper, nor does it
cite to relevant legal principles or analyze
how the facts of
<SPage 311>
this case relate to any
applicable law. As a result of the defendant's
inadequate briefing,<fnr24> we decline to
review her claim that the court improperly
dismissed her counterclaim, in part, on the
ground of sovereign immunity.

<CN>B

<P20>We next turn to the defendant's
claim that the court improperly dismissed
her counterclaim, in part, on the basis of
the prior pending action doctrine. Although
the defendant's briefing of this
claim also is minimal, the defendant clearly
raises two grounds for challenging the
court's decision to dismiss a portion of her
counterclaim on the basis of the prior
pending action doctrine, namely, that the
prior pending action doctrine "does not
apply because one of its key elements&mdash;
identity of parties&mdash;is not met" and because
the two actions seek different relief.
We disagree.

<P20>The following additional facts are relevant
to this claim. Prior to filing her counterclaim,
the defendant commenced an action
in the Superior Court on April 6, 2021,
against a number of parties, including the
department, alleging a variety of claims
regarding the seizure of the goats from
her property. See <EM>Burton</EM> v. <EM>Mason,</EM> Superior
Court, judicial district of Waterbury,
Complex Litigation Docket, Docket No.
CV-21-5028294-S (<EM>Mason</EM>
<SPage 312>
action). That
action is still pending in the Superior
Court. In the present case, in granting the
motion to dismiss, in part, on the basis of
the prior pending action doctrine, the
court stated: "[T]he department argues
that the counterclaim is virtually identical
to the pending claims against the department
in [the <EM>Mason</EM> action]. The remaining
claims are that the department violated
the [defendant's] fourth amendment rights
when DellaRocco lied in his affidavit to
obtain a search warrant and that the department
violated &sect; 22-329a (i) by allowing
favored individuals priority to adopt the
<Page 1012>
goats. In [the <EM>Mason</EM> action], the [defendant]
brings these exact same claims. Although
the relief sought is slightly different,
as the [defendant] seeks monetary
damages in [the <EM>Mason</EM> action] but not in
the present case, and declaratory relief in
the present case but not in [the <EM>Mason</EM>
action], the actions are still virtually identical.
In such instances, the court has discretion
to decide whether the circumstances
justify dismissal. In the present case, the
circumstances clearly justify dismissal.
The counterclaim is yet another transparent
attempt to relitigate Judge Cobb's order
of temporary care and custody. The
[defendant] has already filed a motion to
disqualify Judge Cobb, a motion to vacate,
a motion to reopen the hearing, a motion
to reargue, a motion to declare ... &sect; 22-329a
unconstitutional, a motion to suppress
and for return of property, and a motion
for immediate release of her goats, as well
as motions to reargue these motions. Given
the blatantly `oppressive and vexatious' nature
of the counterclaim, dismissal under
the prior pending action doctrine is justified.
Any claims that the [defendant] may
have against the department and its
agents can be adjudicated in the [<EM>Mason</EM>
action]."

<P20>We next set forth the legal
principles and standard of review that govern
our resolution of this claim. "[T]he
<SPage 313>
prior pending action doctrine permits
the court to dismiss a second case that
raises issues currently pending before the
court. The pendency of a prior suit of the
same character, between the same parties,
brought to obtain the same end or object,
is, at common law, good cause for abatement.
It is so, because there cannot be any
reason or necessity for bringing the second,
and, therefore, it must be oppressive
and vexatious. This is a rule of justice and
equity, generally applicable, and always,
where the two suits are virtually alike, and
in the same jurisdiction.... The policy
behind the doctrine is to prevent unnecessary
litigation that places a burden on
crowded court dockets." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Cameron</EM> v. <EM>Santiago,</EM>
supra, 223 Conn. App. at 840 n.3, 310 A.3d
391.

<P20>"Under the prior pending action
doctrine, the court must determine
whether the two actions are: (1) exactly
alike, i.e., for the same matter, cause and
thing, or seeking the same remedy, and in
the same jurisdiction; (2) virtually alike,
i.e., brought to adjudicate the same underlying
rights of the parties, but perhaps
seeking different remedies; or (3) insufficiently
similar to warrant the doctrine's
application.... If the two actions are exactly
alike or lacking in sufficient similarities,
the trial court has no discretion. In
the former case, the court must dismiss
the second action, and in the latter instance,
the court must allow both cases to
proceed unabated. Where the actions are
virtually, but not exactly alike, however,
the trial court exercises discretion in determining
whether the circumstances justify
dismissal of the second action." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Loch View,
LLC</EM> v. <EM>Windham,</EM> 211 Conn. App. 765,
772-73, 274 A.3d 140 (2022). "In order to
determine whether the actions are virtually
alike, we must examine the pleadings
... to ascertain whether the actions are
brought to adjudicate the same underlying
rights of the parties.... The trial court's
conclusion on the similarities between the
cases is subject to
<SPage 314>
our plenary review."
(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Rousseau</EM>
v. <EM>Weinstein,</EM> 204 Conn. App. 833,
844, 254 A.3d 984 (2021). We also note that
"a motion to dismiss is the proper vehicle
to raise the issue of a prior pending action";
(internal quotation marks omitted)
<EM>A1Z7, LLC</EM> v. <EM>Dombek,</EM> 188 Conn. App.
714, 722 n.2, 205 A.3d 740 (2019); and that
"[t]he prior pending action doctrine applies
equally to claims and counterclaims." <EM>Conti</EM>
v. <EM>Murphy,</EM> 23 Conn. App. 174, 178, 579
A.2d 576 (1990).
<Page 1013>

<P20>Because these claims are seeking different
remedies, we examine the pleadings in
both actions to determine whether they
have been brought to adjudicate the same
underlying rights of the parties. The two
claims in the counterclaim that were dismissed
on the basis of the prior pending
action doctrine alleged a violation of the
defendant's fourth amendment rights
stemming from the allegedly illegal search
of her property and a violation of &sect; 22-329a
(i) by the department. Our review of the
pleadings in the <EM>Mason</EM> action demonstrates
that those very same claims have
been raised against the department in that
action. Like in the counterclaim in the
present case, the defendant alleges in the
<EM>Mason</EM> action that the department violated
her fourth amendment rights because DellaRocco
lied in his testimony at the hearing
on March 30, 2021, his affidavit included
false statements and omitted facts, and
the search of her property was illegal and
was not supported by probable cause. She
also alleges in the <EM>Mason</EM> action that the
department violated &sect; 22-329a (i).

<P20>We conclude, following our review of the
record before us, that the present case and
the <EM>Mason</EM> action both stem from the same
factual circumstance&mdash;the seizure of the
goats from the defendant&mdash;and involve the
same parties and identical claims. Even
though the relief sought in both actions is
not identical, both actions seek the same
goals or objectives, namely, to
<SPage 315>
adjudicate the defendant's rights and
the propriety of the seizure of the goats
and the proceedings that followed. See
<EM>Lodmell</EM> v. <EM>LaFrance,</EM> 154 Conn. App. 329,
335, 107 A.3d 975 (2014) ("`[T]he applicability
of the doctrine does not turn on the
issue of whether the two actions seek the
same remedy.... The key question is
whether the two actions are brought to
adjudicate the same underlying rights.'"),
cert. denied, 315 Conn. 921, 107 A.3d 959
(2015). Moreover, the defendant's argument
that the doctrine does not apply to
the present case because the parties are
not identical fails in light of this court's
decision in <EM>Modzelewski</EM> v. <EM>William Raveis
Real Estate, Inc.,</EM> 65 Conn. App. 708, 783
A.2d 1074, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 948, 788
A.2d 96 (2001). In that case, the defendant
raised a similar argument, which this court
rejected, concluding that, "[w]hile the parties
are not `identical' in that there are two
additional parties to the prior action, the
identical parties to the present action are
involved in the prior one." Id., at 714, 783
A.2d 1074. The reasoning in <EM>Modzelewski</EM>
applies equally to the present case; the
parties in the present action are both involved
in the <EM>Mason</EM> action, and the fact
that there are additional defendants in the
<EM>Mason</EM> action does not preclude application
of the prior pending action doctrine to
the present case. See id. Accordingly, we
agree with the court that both actions are
virtually alike. We further conclude that
the court did not abuse its discretion in
determining that the circumstances justified
dismissal, in part, of the counterclaim
against the department in the present case
on the basis of the prior pending action
doctrine.

<P20>The judgments are affirmed.

<P20>In this opinion the other judges
concurred.
<FN>
<fnt1> Hereinafter, unless otherwise indicated, all
references to &sect; 22-329a in this opinion are to
the version of the statute set forth in the 2022
supplement to the General Statutes.

<fnt2> Although &sect; 19a-341 was amended in 2024;
see Public Acts 2024, No. 24-70, &sect; 1; that
amendment has no bearing on the merits of
this appeal. For simplicity, we refer to the
current revision of the statute.

<fnt3> As a result of the motor vehicle accident
involving the goat, the defendant was arrested
and charged with animal cruelty. That case is
pending before the Superior Court.

<fnt4> Tanya Wescovich, a state animal control
officer, was a coaffiant on the affidavit in
support of the search warrant.

<fnt5> In the verified petition, Dunn also requested
that (1) upon vesting temporary custody of the
animals in the department, the court issue an
order requiring the defendant either to relinquish
ownership of the goats or post a surety
or cash bond with the department, (2) the
court make a finding that the goats were in
imminent harm, neglected and/or cruelly
treated in violation of General Statutes &sect; 53-247,
(3) the court vest permanent ownership
and custody of the goats with the department,
and (4) the court order the defendant to pay
to the department the expenses incurred by
the department to provide proper food, shelter
and care to the goats, calculated at a rate
of $15 per goat per day until ownership of the
goats is vested in the plaintiff, as well as
veterinary costs and expenses incurred.

<fnt6> General Statutes (Supp. 2022) &sect; 22-329a (f)
provides: "If the court issues an order vesting
the animal's temporary care and custody in
some suitable state, municipal or other public
or private agency or person, the owner or
owners shall either relinquish ownership of
the animal or post a surety bond or cash bond
with the agency or person in whom the animal's
temporary care and custody was vested.
The surety bond or cash bond shall be in the
amount of five hundred dollars for each animal
placed in the temporary care or custody
of such agency or person and shall secure
payment for the reasonable expenses of the
agency or person having temporary care and
custody of the animal in caring and providing
for such animal until the court makes a finding
as to the animal's disposition under subsection
(g) of this section. The requirement
that a bond be posted may be waived if such
owner provides satisfactory evidence that
such owner is indigent and unable to pay for
such bond."

<fnt7> In her appellate briefs, the defendant cites
only to other Superior Court animal welfare
cases in which the verified petitions addressed
specific animals in support of her
claim that each of the sixty-five goats had to
be referenced individually in the verified petition
in the present case. See <EM>State ex rel. Dunn</EM>
v. <EM>Kornstein,</EM> Superior Court, judicial district
of Hartford, Docket No. CV-20-6124017-S
(February 20, 2020) (seizure of 1 cow, 137
chickens, 33 ducks, 6 dogs, and 18 cattle);
<EM>State ex rel. Connors</EM> v. <EM>Olajos,</EM> Superior
Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket
No. CV-16-6065975-S (March 8, 2016) (seizure
of 32 horses, 78 chickens, 19 rabbits and
2 dogs); <EM>State ex rel. Dunn</EM> v. <EM>Wilson,</EM> Superior
Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket
No. CV-21-6137026-S (February 4, 2021) (seizure
of eight horses). These cases, in addition
to being nonbinding authority, do not provide
support for that proposition. Although the
verified petition in each case made specific
references to some of the animals seized, each
petition did not do so with respect to the
remainder of the seized animals and, instead,
referred to them generally or as a whole by
category of animal. These cases, thus, do not
support a conclusion that the plaintiff is obligated
under the statute to identify each animal
that is part of the seizure and make
specific factual allegations regarding each animal
individually, and the defendant has not
provided any other authority demonstrating
otherwise.

<fnt8> In an order dated April 13, 2022, the court,
<EM>Bellis, J.,</EM> denied the motion summarily.

<fnt9> On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the defendant
"does not have a fourth amendment
right to suppress evidence in civil proceedings
like animal welfare actions." As the plaintiff
maintains, "[o]ur jurisprudence has long held
that one cannot exclude evidence based on an
alleged fourth amendment violation in civil
cases." Although this court recently determined
that the exclusionary rule does not
apply in the context of a civil animal welfare
action involving a warrantless search; see
<EM>State ex rel. Dunn</EM> v. <EM>Connelly,</EM> 228 Conn. App.
458, 459-60, 325 A.3d 1159 (2024); the present
case, in contrast, involves a claim that the
affidavit in support of the search warrant
contained assertions that were known to be
false and omitted material facts, thereby implicating
<EM>Franks</EM> v. <EM>Delaware,</EM> 438 U.S. 154,
155-56, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667
(1978). See footnote 10 of this opinion. We
need not decide whether the exclusionary rule
applies in such circumstances in light of the
defendant's failure to adequately brief her
claim regarding her motion to suppress.

<fnt10> We note that, in her motion to suppress,
the defendant cited to <EM>Franks</EM> v. <EM>Delaware,</EM> 438
U.S. 154, 155-56, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d
667 (1978), in support of her claim that the
warrant affidavit was premised on false statements
and omitted material facts. "In <EM>Franks</EM>
v. <EM>Delaware,</EM> supra, [438 U.S. at] 155-56 [98
S.Ct. 2674], the United States Supreme Court
held that where the defendant makes a substantial
preliminary showing that a false statement
knowingly and intentionally, or with
reckless disregard for the truth, was included
by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, <EM>and</EM> if
the allegedly false statement is necessary to
the finding of probable cause, the [f]ourth
[a]mendment requires that a hearing be held
at the defendant's request.... The court in
<EM>Franks</EM> mentioned only a false statement ...
included ... in the warrant affidavit; subsequent
cases, however, have extended <EM>Franks</EM>
to include material omissions from such an
affidavit." (Emphasis in original; internal

555 U.S. 916, 129 S. Ct. 271, 172 L. Ed.
2d 200 (2008). On appeal, the defendant has
neither cited to <EM>Franks</EM> nor argued in her
appellate briefs that she was entitled to a
<EM>Franks</EM> hearing. We, therefore, deem any such
claim abandoned. See <EM>Samelko</EM> v. <EM>Kingstone

<fnt11> We are mindful that "[i]t is the established
policy of the Connecticut courts to be solicitous
of [self-represented] litigants and when it
does not interfere with the rights of other
parties to construe the rules of practice liberally
in favor of the [self-represented] party....
Nonetheless, [a]lthough we allow [self-represented]
litigants some latitude, the right
of self-representation provides no attendant
license not to comply with relevant rules of
procedural and substantive law." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Burton</EM> v. <EM>Dept. of

... and procedure as those qualified to practice
law'"), cert. denied, 334 Conn. 905, 220

adhere to the well-founded policy to accord
leeway to self-represented parties in the appeal
process, our deference is not unlimited;
nor is a litigant on appeal relieved of the
obligation to sufficiently articulate a claim so
that it is recognizable to a reviewing court."

Moreover, although the defendant is a self-represented
party, she was a licensed attorney
prior to being disbarred in 2008; see https://www.jud.ct.gov/attorneyfirminquiry/JurisDetail.aspx
(last visited November 15, 2024);
and, therefore, has legal training that most

parties and is well versed with the
rules of appellate procedure. See <EM>Turner</EM> v.

<fnt12> We note that there is nothing in the statute
that prevents parties from agreeing to hold a
hearing in one step, as long as the hearing is
held within fourteen days of the show cause
order.

<fnt13> In <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Kane,</EM> 218 Conn. 151, 588 A.2d
179 (1991), the Supreme Court addressed a
similar issue in the context of a probable
cause hearing. Pursuant to General Statutes
&sect; 54-46a, a defendant charged with any crime
punishable by death, life imprisonment without
the possibility of release or life imprisonment
is entitled to a probable cause hearing.
In <EM>Kane,</EM> the defendant argued on appeal that
he was denied due process because the statute
governing probable cause hearings precluded
him from having a hearing on his motion to
suppress at the probable cause stage of the
proceedings. See id., at 155, 588 A.2d 179. In
rejecting the defendant's claim, the Supreme
Court explained that "[a] preliminary hearing
is not designed to be a dress rehearsal for the
trial.... [A]s long as the defendant was afforded
the opportunity to challenge the admissibility
of his statements at trial, the adjudicatory
phase of the proceeding against him,
his right to due process was preserved." (Citations
omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)
Id., at 159, 588 A.2d 179.

<fnt14> General Statutes &sect; 19a-341 is titled, "Agricultural
or farming operation not deemed a
nuisance; exceptions. Spring or well water
collection operation not deemed a nuisance,"
is located in the chapter of the General Statutes
titled, "Public Health and Well-being,"
and provides in relevant part: "(a) Notwithstanding
the provisions of any general statute
or municipal ordinance or regulation
pertaining to nuisances to the contrary, no
agricultural or farming operation, place, establishment
or facility, or any of its appurtenances,
or the operation thereof, shall be
deemed to constitute a nuisance, either public
or private, due to alleged objectionable
(1) odor from livestock, manure, fertilizer or
feed, (2) noise from livestock or farm equipment
used in normal, generally acceptable
farming procedures, (3) dust created during
plowing or cultivation operations, (4) use of
chemicals, provided such chemicals and the
method of their application conform to practices
approved by the Commissioner of Energy
and Environmental Protection or, where
applicable, the Commissioner of Public
Health, or (5) water pollution from livestock
or crop production activities, except the pollution
of public or private drinking water
supplies, provided such activities conform to
acceptable management practices for pollution
control approved by the Commissioner
of Energy and Environmental Protection;
provided such agricultural or farming operation,
place, establishment or facility has been
in operation for one year or more and has
not been substantially changed, and such operation
follows generally accepted agricultural
practices. <EM>Inspection and approval of the
agricultural or farming operation, place, establishment
or facility by the Commissioner
of Agriculture or the commissioner's designee
shall be prima facie evidence that such operation
follows generally accepted agricultural
practices</EM>...." (Emphasis added.)

<fnt15> Proof by a preponderance of the evidence
means, after a consideration of all the evidence
fairly and impartially, there is enough
evidence to produce "a reasonable belief that
what is sought to be proven is more likely
true than not true." (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Aviles,</EM> 277 Conn. 281, 317,
891 A.2d 935, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 840, 127
S. Ct. 108, 166 L. Ed. 2d 69 (2006). Thus, to
meet the fair preponderance of the evidence
standard, the evidence had to induce a reasonable
belief that it is more probable or
likely than not that the goats were neglected
or cruelly treated. See generally <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Reilly,</EM>
60 Conn. App. 716, 725, 760 A.2d 1001
(2000).

<fnt16> The reasonable cause standard is akin to
that of probable cause. See <EM>Karen</EM> v. <EM>Loftus,</EM>
228 Conn. App. 163, 193, 324 A.3d 793
(2024); <EM>Prioleau</EM> v. <EM>Commission on Human
Rights & Opportunities,</EM> 116 Conn. App. 776,
783, 977 A.2d 267 (2009). Probable cause "is
a bona fide belief in the existence of facts
essential under the law for the action and
such as would warrant a [person] of ordinary
caution, prudence and judgment, under the
circumstances, in entertaining it." (Emphasis
omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)
<EM>Adriani</EM> v. <EM>Commission on Human Rights &
Opportunities,</EM> 220 Conn. 307, 316, 596 A.2d
426 (1991).

<fnt17> We note that the defendant has not adequately
briefed her claim that the court applied
the wrong standard. In light of the inadequate
briefing, the plaintiff briefly counters
this claim by asserting that the defendant
incorrectly argues that a preponderance of
the evidence standard applies and that the
correct standard is the reasonable cause standard.
We thus leave for another day our decision
on this issue.

<fnt18> In <EM>State ex rel. Gregan</EM> v. <EM>Koczur,</EM> supra,
287 Conn. at 157-58, 947 A.2d 282, "the
defendant was keeping forty-six live cats and
one dead cat in a 950 square foot residence,
much of which was so cluttered with personal
effects, trash and bags of raw garbage that it
was unusable. The [trial] court ... found, and
the evidence amply demonstrated, that the
residence was, and had been for some time,
in a `deplorable, filthy, unsanitary [and] unhealthy'
condition, with cat feces, vomit and
urine present throughout.... [A] person of
ordinary intelligence would know that confining
forty-six cats in these unhealthy conditions
constituted a failure to provide proper
care for the cats under any reasonable standard."
Our Supreme Court thus found that
the defendant's conduct in allowing the cats
to live in unsanitary and unhealthy conditions
fell within the "`unmistakable core of prohibited
conduct'" and constituted neglect under
&sect; 22-329a. Id., at 157, 947 A.2d 282.

<fnt19> Of course, in light of our conclusion that
the plaintiff established that it is more probable
than not that the goats were neglected or
cruelly treated, it necessarily follows that the
court correctly determined that the plaintiff
proved there was reasonable cause that the
goats were neglected or cruelly treated.

<fnt20> Instead, the defendant makes one reference
to &sect; 22-329a (g) (1), arguing that it
"mandates that, once a judge has made a
finding of neglect and cruel treatment, as
Judge Cobb did in her April 9, 2021 order,
she was under obligation to immediately vest
ownership of the goats, as distinguished from
temporary custody, in a [26 U.S.C.] &sect; 501 (c)
(3) facility permitted by law to care for neglected
and cruelly treated animals, such as
[the animal rescue she had suggested], with
no prior hearing requirement, or a state, municipality
or individual." This statute does not
pertain to motions to relinquish or in any way
explain why the court's denial of the defendant's
motion was improper. Furthermore,
we do not construe the statutory language as
requiring the court to immediately vest ownership
of the goats to an animal rescue of the
defendant's choosing. The statute specifically
provides that, "[i]f, after hearing, the court
finds that the animal is neglected or cruelly
treated, it shall vest ownership of the animal
in <EM>any state, municipal or other public or
private agency which is permitted by law to
care for neglected or cruelly treated animals</EM> or
with any person found to be suitable or worthy
of such responsibility by the court." (Emphasis
added.) General Statutes (Supp. 2022)
&sect; 22-329a (g) (1). The court complied with the
statute when it exercised its discretion to vest
ownership of the goats with the department.

<fnt21> There is also no merit to the defendant's
claim that she paid a sufficient bond pursuant
to Practice Book &sect; 38-8, which pertains to
cash bail in criminal matters, as the present
case is controlled by the bond provision set
forth in &sect; 22-329a (f).

<fnt22> The court declined to grant the motion to
dismiss on the ground of sovereign immunity
as to the defendant's first two claims of violations
of the fourth amendment and &sect; 22-329a
(i). Nevertheless, as to those two claims, the
court granted the motion to dismiss on the
ground that the claims were precluded under
the prior pending action doctrine, which we
address in part VIII B of this opinion.

<fnt23> "The principle that the state cannot be
sued without its consent, or sovereign immunity,
is well established under our case
law.... It has deep roots in this state and our
legal system in general, finding its origin in
ancient common law.... Not only have we
recognized the state's immunity as an entity,
but [w]e have also recognized that because
the state can act only through its officers and
agents, a suit against a state officer concerning
a matter in which the officer represents
the state is, in effect, against the state....
Exceptions to this doctrine are few and narrowly
construed under our jurisprudence....
<EM>Chief Information Officer</EM> v. <EM>Computers Plus
Center, Inc.,</EM> 310 Conn. 60, 79-80, 74 A.3d
1242 (2013)." (Internal quotation marks omitted.)
<EM>Jakobowski</EM> v. <EM>State,</EM> 219 Conn. App. 839,
848, 296 A.3d 226 (2023). "[T]he doctrine of
sovereign immunity implicates subject matter
jurisdiction and is therefore a basis for granting
a motion to dismiss." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Spillane</EM> v. <EM>Lamont,</EM> 350
Conn. 119, 126, 323 A.3d 1007 (2024).

<P20>"It is ... well established that [t]he sovereign
immunity enjoyed by the state is not
absolute." (Internal quotation marks omitted.)
<EM>Dept. of Public Health</EM> v. <EM>Estrada,</EM> 349 Conn.
223, 237, 315 A.3d 1081 (2024). Indeed,
"[o]ur case law has identified three recognized
exceptions to sovereign immunity: `(1)
when the legislature, either expressly or by
force of a necessary implication, statutorily
waives the state's sovereign immunity ... (2)
when an action seeks declaratory or injunctive
relief on the basis of a substantial claim
that the state or one of its officers has violated
the plaintiff's constitutional rights ... and (3)
when an action seeks declaratory or injunctive
relief on the basis of a substantial allegation
of wrongful conduct to promote an illegal
purpose in excess of the officer's statutory
authority.'" <EM>Spillane</EM> v. <EM>Lamont,</EM> supra, 350
Conn. at 127, 323 A.3d 1007. Relevant to this
appeal are the second and third exceptions.
"For a claim made pursuant to the second
exception, complaining of unconstitutional
acts, [our Supreme Court] require[s] that [t]he
allegations of such a complaint and the factual
underpinnings if placed in issue, must
clearly demonstrate an incursion upon constitutionally
protected interests.... For a claim
under the third exception, the plaintiffs must
do more than allege that the defendants' conduct
was in excess of their statutory authority;
they also must allege or otherwise establish
facts that reasonably support those allegations....
In the absence of a proper factual
basis in the complaint to support the applicability
of these exceptions, the granting of a
motion to dismiss on sovereign immunity
grounds is proper." (Citations omitted; internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Columbia Air
Services, Inc.</EM> v. <EM>Dept. of Transportation,</EM> 293
Conn. 342, 350, 977 A.2d 636 (2009).

<fnt24> For similar reasons, we also decline to
review the defendant's claim that the court
should have granted her motion to open and
vacate the judgment rendered in favor of the
plaintiff on the ground of fraud. Like with
many of her other claims on appeal, the defendant
has provided no citation to authority
to support her claim, let alone an analysis of
relevant authority as it pertains to her claim.
Instead, in two short paragraphs, she makes
unfounded allegations about alleged retaliatory
conduct of the trial judge. In its order
denying the motion to open and vacate, the
court cautioned the defendant "not to assert a
claim unless there is a basis in law and fact
for doing so that is not frivolous" and that
"personal attacks on the court are inappropriate
and will not be tolerated" and may subject
the defendant to sanctions, should she continue
to assert groundless claims. We echo those
words of caution and remind the defendant
that unsupported accusations that have no
basis in fact or law cannot be properly considered
by this court and have no place in
proceedings before this court.

[MT]
<P20>The respondent mother, Jessica K.,
appeals following the trial court's judgments
terminating her parental rights with
respect to her children,
<SPage 373>
twins Jayden
and Jaelynn.<fnr1> On appeal, the respondent
claims that the trial court violated her due
process rights under the fourteenth
amendment to the federal constitution with
respect to the termination trial in (1) constructively
depriving her of her right to
counsel, (2) denying her assigned counsel's
request for a continuance, and (3) finding
that the respondent and her counsel had
adequate notice of the proceeding. We affirm
the judgments of the trial court.<fnr2>

<P20>The following facts and procedural history
are relevant to our consideration of the
respondent's appeal. Although this appeal
concerns only the respondent's parental
rights with respect to Jayden and Jaelynn,
the respondent has two older children. Prior
to the birth of Jayden and Jaelynn, the
two older children had been adjudicated
neglected due to the respondent's substance
abuse, and the respondent's parental
rights with respect to the older children
were terminated at separate proceedings
in 2021. Thereafter, Jayden and Jaelynn
were born prematurely in August, 2022.
The Department of Children and Families
(department) immediately became involved
with the children's care after a mandated
reporter at the hospital notified the department
that the children had tested positive
for cocaine and opiates at birth. Due
to their premature births and exposure to
drugs in utero, the children have medically
complex needs.

<P20>On August 30, 2022, the petitioner, the
Commissioner of Children and Families,
filed neglect petitions on behalf of the children.
On the same date, the petitioner
obtained ex parte orders of temporary custody.
The
<SPage 374>
respondent failed to appear at
both the September 7, 2022 hearing on the
orders of temporary custody and the September
28, 2022 initial plea hearing on the
neglect petitions, and, each time, the court
rendered a default judgment against the
respondent. After the respondent again
failed to appear at the October 12, 2022
dispositional hearing on the neglect petitions,
the court adjudicated the children
neglected and committed them to the care
of the petitioner.

<P20>On June 6, 2023, the court approved
permanency plans for the termination of
the respondent's parental rights. On July
11, 2023, pursuant to the approved permanency
plans, the petitioner filed a petition
for termination of parental rights on behalf
of each child. On the same day, the petitioner
also filed, and the court granted, a
<Page 1017>
motion for order of notice by publication
with respect to the respondent.<fnr3> On July
20, 2023, notice of the next hearing, which
was scheduled for August 2, 2023, was
published in the Waterbury Republican-American.<fnr4>
On the same day the notice
was published, Morgan Bell, a department
social worker assigned to the respondent's
case, spoke on the phone with the respondent,
who was at Rushford, a provider of
addiction and mental health treatment programs,
after entering an inpatient drug
detoxification treatment program
<SPage 375>
two
days earlier, and told the respondent about
the upcoming hearing.<fnr5> The respondent
also asked Bell about visitation with her
children, but a clinician at Rushford informed
Bell that the respondent could not
have visitors while in the detoxification
treatment program. On July 26, 2023, the
respondent went to the trial court clerk's
office and applied for the appointment of
counsel with respect to the termination
petitions, indicating on the application that
she was homeless and had "just got[ten]
out of detox...." She listed a homeless
shelter for her address. Thereafter, Attorney
Deborah Dombek was appointed counsel
for the respondent, and she filed her
appearance on July 31, 2023.

<P20>Two days after Dombek filed her appearance,
on August 2, 2023, the court,
<EM>Torres, J.,</EM> held a hearing on the termination
petitions. The respondent did not
appear. The court made a finding of notice
by publication to the respondent and defaulted
the respondent for failure to appear.
Dombek objected to proceeding with
the hearing without her client, explaining
to the court that she had been appointed
just days earlier and had not been able to
communicate with the respondent because
the phone number the department had
provided for her was no longer in service.
Dombek then orally requested additional
time to try to locate the respondent, stating
that she had received new information
concerning the respondent's whereabouts
from a department worker earlier that
day. The court overruled
<SPage 376>
Dombek's objection
and denied her request for a continuance.

<P20>The court proceeded to hold a termination
trial on the merits. The petitioner
presented her evidence, which consisted
only of testimony by Bell and the department's
social study, which was admitted as
a full exhibit.<fnr6> Dombek did not cross-examine
<Page 1018>
Bell, and when the court asked Dombek
whether she wished to present any
evidence, she stated that she did not and
reiterated that she had not had an opportunity
to speak with her client.

<P20>On the basis of the evidence presented,
the court rendered a decision from the
bench terminating the respondent's parental
rights, pursuant to General Statutes
&sect; 17a-112 (j),<fnr7> on the grounds that the
respondent
<SPage 377>
had abandoned her children
and had failed to rehabilitate herself.<fnr8> With
respect to the ground of abandonment, the
court found that "[the respondent] has
failed to maintain a reasonable degree of
interest, concern or responsibility. From
the birth of these children, it looks like the
[respondent] has failed to visit with them.
She hasn't provided any gifts, letters or
financial support during the time that the
case has been pending and the filing of the
termination petitions ... [a]nd she has not
inquired about the children's well-being as
of the filing of [these] termination of parental
rights petition[s]." As to the ground
of failure to rehabilitate, the court made
the following findings: "[Neglect] [p]etitions
were filed on August 30 [2022]. On
September 7, 2022, the [respondent was]
defaulted for [her] failure to appear....
On September 28, 2022, both children were
adjudicated `neglected,' based on the default
of [the respondent]. Specific steps
were issued ... and have been provided
for the [respondent] as an outline for [her]
to rehabilitate. [The respondent] has [not]
made [herself] available to the [department]
<Page 1019>
to review or engage in services, and
it is unlikely at this point in [her life] that
[she is] likely to take a responsible position
in these children's lives, who have been in
care for almost a year of time."<fnr9> The court
further concluded
<SPage 378>
that it was in the
children's best interests for the respondent's
parental rights to be terminated.

<P20>After rendering its judgments, the court
stated that the default judgments against
the respondent would remain on file for
120 days and that if Dombek were to
discover "any information that ... [would
have] precluded [the respondent] from appearing
in court today," she was "more
than welcome" to present that evidence by
November 30, 2023.<fnr10>

<P20>Thereafter, on November 8, 2023, the
respondent moved to open the August 2,
2023 default judgments pursuant to General
Statutes &sect; 52-212 (a)<fnr11> on the ground
that she "was homeless for a period of
time and was not properly served" with
the termination petitions. The petitioner
filed a written objection specifically asserting.
that the respondent did not comply
with &sect; 52-212 (a) in that she did not state a
good defense that existed at the time the
termination of parental rights judgments
were rendered.<fnr12> On January 4, 2024,<fnr13> the
<SPage 379>
court, <EM>Torres, J.,</EM> held a hearing on the
motion to open, at which both the respondent
and Dombek were present. Dombek
argued at the hearing that "[the motion to
open is] all under good cause.... [The
court] had given me the opportunity in [its
August 2, 2023] order ... that if I filed
[this motion] in a timely fashion and new
information came to light about [the respondent's]
whereabouts, that I could, in
fact, open the [August 2, 2023] judgment[s].
The other arguments are that my
client, I believe, was in a rehab facility
.... She was not served.... It's a due
process right. It's the most fundamental
right. The most precious of rights [is] to
raise your children without government
interference, and I think that [the respondent]
deserves an opportunity to have the
case heard on its merits...." Following
<Page 1020>
Dombek's argument, the court inquired
whether the respondent wished to testify,
stating: "She doesn't have to. She has the
right to remain silent. If [she is] going to
testify ... the issues she's going to have to
testify to [are] where was she, what the
defense is.... So, it's grounds [of abandonment
and failure to rehabilitate] from
the time of the birth of the children to the
time of the filing of the [termination petitions]
... there needs to be a defense. So,
if [the respondent is] able to testify as to
... a valid defense as to the grounds for
abandonment and failure to rehabilitate,
then [the court will] hear that testimony."
After a brief discussion with her counsel
off the record, the respondent declined to
testify. The court proceeded to render a
decision from the bench denying the motion
to open, finding that the respondent
failed to satisfy either requirement of &sect; 52-212
(a) because she did not present a
<SPage 380>
"good defense ... with respect to the
[termination] petition[s]" regarding either
ground for termination and because "there
[was] no information before the court that
there was something that prevented [the
respondent] from presenting [a] valid defense
at the time of the [August 2, 2023
hearing]."<fnr14>

<P20>The respondent thereafter filed an appeal
from the court's denial of her motion
to open, and, on March 25, 2024, this court
granted the respondent's motion for permission
to file a late appeal challenging the
trial court's August 2, 2023 judgments terminating
the respondent's parental rights.

<CN>I

<P20>The respondent first claims that
the trial court constructively deprived her
of her right to the effective assistance of
counsel under the fourteenth amendment
to the federal constitution "[b]y requiring
[Dombek] to represent a client she had
never met, let alone discussed the case
with, at [the August 2, 2023] termination of
parental rights trial after having been assigned
only three days earlier...." The
respondent claims that the court's constructive
denial of counsel constitutes
structural error for which prejudice is presumed
and, therefore, a rule of automatic
reversal applies. We disagree and decline
to apply such a rule in the context of child
protection cases. Accordingly, even if the
respondent was constructively deprived of
her constitutional right to the effective assistance
of counsel at the August 2, 2023
termination proceeding,<fnr15> we conclude
<SPage 381>
that the respondent fails to show resulting
<Page 1021>
prejudice and, therefore, any violation
of that right was harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt.

<P20>It is clear, and the parties do not
dispute, that the respondent had a statutory
right to counsel at the termination proceeding.<fnr16>
"Because of the substantial interests
involved, a parent in a termination
of parental rights hearing has the [statutory]
right not only to counsel but to the
effective assistance of counsel." <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>Anonymous,</EM> 179 Conn. 155, 160, 425 A.2d
939 (1979). When the right to effective
assistance of counsel is challenged, our
Supreme Court has adopted the following
standard: "The range of competence ...
requires not errorless counsel, and not
counsel judged ineffective by hindsight,
but counsel whose performance is reasonably
competent, or within the range of
competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary
training and skill in
<SPage 382>
[that particular
area of the] law." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) Id. "The defendant must,
moreover, demonstrate that the lack of
competency contributed to the termination
of parental rights." Id. Even where a parent
in a termination proceeding has a constitutional,
rather than merely statutory,
right to counsel, the parent must show
resulting prejudice to prevail on a claimed
violation of that right. "Under such circumstances,
it would be a waste of judicial
resources, and a pedantic exercise, to delve
deeply into the constitutional merits of a
claim that can appropriately be resolved in
accordance with the relevant harmless error
analysis." (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) <EM>In re Amias I.,</EM> 343 Conn. 816,
834, 276 A.3d 955 (2022); see id., at 837-38,
276 A.3d 955 (assuming that children have
constitutional right to conflict free counsel
in termination proceeding and concluding
that any violation was harmless beyond
reasonable doubt).

<P20>On appeal, the respondent claims
that the court's constructive deprivation of
counsel constitutes a structural error and,
therefore, a showing of prejudice is not
necessary to merit reversal. "Structural
[error] cases defy analysis by harmless
error standards because the entire conduct
of the trial, from beginning to end, is
obviously affected...." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Brown,</EM> 279
Conn. 493, 505, 903 A.2d 169 (2006). In
making this claim, the respondent relies
principally on <EM>United States</EM> v. <EM>Cronic,</EM> 466
U.S. 648, 104 S. Ct. 2039, 80 L. Ed. 2d 657
(1984). In <EM>Cronic,</EM> the United States Supreme
Court held that, although a defendant
claiming ineffective assistance of
counsel under the sixth amendment to the
federal constitution generally must show
resulting prejudice, "[t]here are ... circumstances
that are so likely to prejudice
the accused" in a criminal proceeding that
a presumption of prejudice applies, including,
inter alia, "when although counsel is
available to assist the accused during trial,
the likelihood that any lawyer, even a fully
competent
<SPage 383>
one, could provide effective
assistance is so small that a presumption
of prejudice is appropriate...." Id., at
658-60, 104 S.Ct. 2039. Specifically, the
respondent claims that <EM>Cronic</EM>'s presumption
of prejudice applies in this case because
the court called on Dombek "to render
<Page 1022>
assistance in a situation in which no
competent attorney could do so." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.)

<P20>We disagree with the respondent's
contention that <EM>Cronic</EM> applies in the
context of the respondent's deprivation of
counsel claim. Connecticut courts consistently
have declined to apply the structural
error doctrine in the child protection context.<fnr17>
"[T]he significant differences between
child dependency proceedings and
other judicial proceedings militate decisively
against applying a per se reversible
error rule in dependency cases." <EM>In re
Amias I.,</EM> supra, 343 Conn. at 840, 276
A.3d 955. This is because "dependent children
have a critical interest in avoiding
unnecessary delays to their long-term
placement." (Internal quotation marks
omitted.) Id., at 841, 276 A.3d 955. "[A]
sense of <EM>permanency,</EM> in and of itself, is
crucial for a child's welfare." (Emphasis in
original.) <EM>In re Ivory W.,</EM> 342 Conn. 692,
734, 271 A.3d 633 (2022). These interests
<SPage 384>
are especially critical here, where the
respondent's children have medically complex
needs that require a stable caregiver
capable of attending medical appointments,
coordinating treatment, and meeting their
ongoing medical needs. Accordingly, we
cannot agree "that prejudice is irrelevant
in a dependency proceeding when the welfare
of the child is at issue and delay in
resolution of the proceeding is inherently
prejudicial to the child.... [T]he price
that would be paid for [applying such a
rule], in the form of needless reversals of
dependency judgments, is unacceptably
high in light of the strong public interest
in prompt resolution of these cases so that
the children may receive loving and secure
home environments as soon as reasonably
possible." (Internal quotation marks omitted.)
<EM>In re Amias I.,</EM> supra, at 840-41, 276
A.3d 955.

<P20>Because we conclude that <EM>Cronic</EM>'s presumption
of prejudice does not apply in
this case, the respondent's constructive deprivation
of counsel claim is subject to
harmless error review.<fnr18> See, e.g., <EM>In re
Gabriel S.,</EM> 347 Conn. 223, 237-38, 296 A.3d
829 (2023) (noting that, even if it were to
conclude that respondent parent's due process
rights were violated at termination of
parental rights proceeding, respondent's
claim would fail under harmless error review).
On appeal, the respondent argues
that the petitioner cannot prove the harmlessness
of the alleged violation "because
without relying on impermissible speculation,
<Page 1023>
it cannot demonstrate that the result
would have been the same...." We disagree
and conclude that the record is sufficient
for us to determine that, even if the
court constructively deprived the respondent
of her right to counsel, any violation
was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
<SPage 385>

<P20>We first reiterate that, although
the court defaulted the respondent
for her failure to appear at the August 2,
2023 proceeding, the court, before rendering
its judgments, held a trial on the merits,
requiring the petitioner to prove by
clear and convincing evidence the statutory
requirements to terminate the respondent's
parental rights, including the
grounds for termination and that it was in
the minor children's best interests for the
respondent's parental rights to be terminated.
Although the respondent was not
present at the termination trial held at the
August 2, 2023 proceeding, she thereafter
moved to open the August 2, 2023 judgments
terminating her parental rights. It
is well settled that a party who has filed a
motion to open has the burden of showing
(1) "reasonable cause, or that a good cause
of action or defense in whole or in part
existed at the time of the rendition of the
judgment [he or she seeks to open]" and
(2) "that [he or she] was prevented by
mistake, accident or other reasonable
cause from ... making the defense." General
Statutes &sect; 52-212 (a). It is thus clear
that to prevail on a motion to open, two
things must occur. "There must be a showing
that (1) a good defense, the nature of
which must be set forth, existed at the
time judgment was rendered, and (2) the
party seeking to set aside the judgment
was prevented from making that defense
because of mistake, accident or other reasonable
cause.... Since the conjunctive
and meaning in addition to is employed
between the parts of the two prong test,
both tests must be met." (Citation omitted;
internal quotation marks omitted.) <EM>In re
Ilyssa G.,</EM> 105 Conn. App. 41, 45-46, 936
A.2d 674 (2007), cert. denied, 285 Conn.
918, 943 A.2d 475 (2008). "The manifest
purpose of a motion to open ... is to
provide a mechanism by which a defaulted
party has an opportunity to be heard." <EM>In
re Skylar F.,</EM> 191 Conn. App. 200, 208, 215
A.3d 750 (2019); see id. (concluding that
respondent father had opportunity to be
heard in connection
<SPage 386>
with court's judgment
adjudicating his child neglected, rendered
after respondent was defaulted for
failure to appear, because "[b]y filing the
motion to open, the respondent invoked his
right to due process, specifically, the right
to be heard as to why he failed to appear
and whether he had a good defense [to the
neglect petition]").

<P20>Accordingly, in filing the motion to open
the August 2, 2023 judgments, the respondent
had an opportunity to be heard with
respect to the judgments terminating her
parental rights. On appeal, the respondent
does not claim that she lacked adequate
representation of counsel at any point during
the pendency of her motion to open,
and the record indicates that the respondent
had ample time to prepare with counsel
for the January 4, 2024 hearing on her
motion to open.<fnr19> Nonetheless, the respondent,
both in her written motion to open
and at the January 4, 2024 hearing on the
motion, failed to present <EM>any</EM> evidence with
respect to a good defense to the termination
petitions.<fnr20> Accordingly, where the
<Page 1024>
<SPage 387>
respondent and her counsel had an opportunity
to present evidence challenging
the termination of her parental rights and
failed to do so, we cannot conclude that the
respondent would have been able to present
such evidence at the August 2 proceeding
if not for the court allegedly depriving
her of the right to counsel.

<P20>For the first time on appeal, however,
the respondent argues, "[b]y way of an
appellate offer of proof," that she "did
make efforts to visit with her children,
was taking steps to address her substance
abuse, and often did not have
notice of court proceedings." Still, the
respondent fails to assert with any specificity
what additional evidence she
would have introduced, had she not
been constructively deprived of counsel
at the termination proceeding, that
would have rebutted the petitioner's evidence
or affected the ultimate outcome
of the proceeding.<fnr21> See <EM>In re Ivory W.,</EM>
supra, 342 Conn. at 732
<SPage 388>
n.26, 271
A.3d 633 (noting that, even if trial court
unconstitutionally precluded respondent
from presenting defense to termination
of parental rights petition by improperly
denying her request for continuance, it
was incumbent on respondent to make
<Page 1025>
"proffer of the specific testimony" explaining
how her testimony could have
affected outcome of termination proceeding
had court granted continuance). The
respondent, in support of her claims on
appeal, points specifically only to her request
for visitation during the July 20,
2023 phone call with Bell and to the
fact that she had been in a detoxification
treatment program at Rushford.
Bell, however, testified to both these
points during the August 2, 2023 proceeding,
and the respondent fails to explain
how, had she been able to present
evidence that had <EM>already</EM> been presented
by the petitioner, the outcome of the
proceeding might have been different.
Additionally, the respondent fails to
point to any specific evidence to support
her claim on appeal that she often
lacked notice of court proceedings. Even
if she had, however, such evidence
would have been extraneous to the
court's finding of abandonment, which,
rather than relying on the respondent's
lack of attendance at prior proceedings,
relied only on the respondent's failure
to visit with the children, her failure to
provide any financial or emotional support,
and her lack of interest in the
children's well-being. It is thus clear
that none of the evidence the respondent
claims to proffer on appeal would
have affected the court's finding of
abandonment.<fnr22> The
<SPage 389>
respondent therefore
fails to explain on appeal what additional
evidence she would have presented,
had the court not constructively
deprived her of counsel, that could have
affected the ultimate outcome of the August
2, 2023 proceeding.

<P20>Accordingly, even if the court constructively
deprived the respondent of her constitutional
right to counsel at the August 2,
2023 proceeding, we conclude that any violation
was harmless beyond a reasonable
doubt.

<CN>II

<P20>Next, the respondent claims that
the court violated her due process rights in
denying Dombek's oral request for a continuance
at the August 2, 2023 proceeding.
Because Dombek did not frame the request
for a continuance as a matter of due
process,<fnr23> we review the respondent's unpreserved
constitutional claim pursuant to
<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Golding,</EM> 213 Conn. 233, 239-40,
567 A.2d 823 (1989), as modified by <EM>In re
Yasiel R.,</EM> 317 Conn. 773, 781, 120 A.3d
1188 (2015).<fnr24> "The test set forth in <EM>Golding</EM>
applies in civil as well as criminal
<Page 1026>
cases.... Pursuant to the <EM>Golding</EM> doctrine,
we may review an unpreserved claim
only if <EM>all</EM> of the following conditions
<SPage 390>
are
met: (1) the record is adequate to review
the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is
of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation
of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged
constitutional violation ... exists
and ... deprived the defendant of a fair
trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error
analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate
harmlessness of the alleged constitutional
violation beyond a reasonable
doubt.... The first two <EM>Golding</EM> requirements
involve whether the claim is reviewable,
and the second two involve whether
there was constitutional error requiring a
new trial." (Emphasis in original; internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>In re Na-Ki J.,</EM>
222 Conn. App. 1, 7, 303 A.3d 1206, cert.
denied, 348 Conn. 929, 304 A.3d 860 (2023).

<P20>We assume, without deciding, that
the respondent's claim satisfies the first
three prongs of <EM>Golding,</EM> and we proceed
to determine whether, under <EM>Golding</EM>'s
fourth prong, the court's denial of Dombek's
request for a continuance to locate
her client was harmless error. As set forth
previously in this opinion, Dombek subsequently
located the respondent, and the
respondent thereafter filed the motion to
open the August 2, 2023 judgments. In
doing so, the respondent had the opportunity
to be heard with respect to the termination
judgments at the January 4, 2024
hearing on her motion to open. Despite
having nearly two `months to prepare with
her counsel for the upcoming January 4,
2024 hearing, the respondent failed to
present <EM>any</EM> evidence with respect to a
good defense to the termination of her
parental rights. We therefore conclude
that the court's denial of Dombek's request
for a continuance was harmless beyond a
reasonable doubt for the same reasons set
forth in part I of this opinion. Accordingly,
the respondent's claim fails under the
fourth prong of <EM>Golding.</EM><fnr25>
<SPage 391>

<CN>III

<P20>The respondent next claims that the
court violated her due process rights in
failing to provide her and her counsel with
adequate notice of the August 2, 2023 proceeding.
Specifically, the respondent
claims that notice was constitutionally insufficient
in that the court (1) failed to
notify Dombek that the hearing would be
an evidentiary trial to terminate the respondent's
parental rights, (2) failed to
state the grounds for the termination of
parental rights petitions, and (3) improperly
relied on notice by publication. Because
the respondent did not raise these arguments
before the trial court, we review her
unpreserved constitutional claim pursuant
to <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Golding,</EM> supra, 213 Conn. at
239-40, 567 A.2d 823.<fnr26>
<Page 1027>

<P20>We assume, without deciding,
that the respondent's claim satisfies the
first three prongs of <EM>Golding,</EM> and we conclude
that her claim fails under <EM>Golding</EM>'s
fourth prong for the same reasons set
forth in parts I and II of this opinion.<fnr27>
Even if we were to assume that notice
<SPage 392>
was constitutionally insufficient, the respondent
fails to explain what additional
evidence she would have presented had
she and her counsel received proper notice
of the August 2, 2023 proceeding. See, e.g.,
<EM>In re Gabriel S.,</EM> supra, 347 Conn. at 238,
296 A.3d 829 (finding any constitutional
violation harmless beyond reasonable
doubt where respondent made "no claim
that there was additional evidence on that
issue that he would have presented if he
had received adequate notice"). The respondent
does not challenge the sufficiency
of the court's notice regarding the January
4, 2024 hearing on her motion to open, and
we reiterate that the respondent failed to
put on any evidence regarding a good defense
to the termination of her parental
rights despite having the opportunity&mdash;and
the statutory burden&mdash;to do so at that
hearing.

<P20>The judgments are affirmed.

<P20>In this opinion the other judges
concurred.
<FN>
<fnt*> In accordance with the spirit and intent of
General Statutes &sect; 46b-142 (b) and Practice
Book &sect; 79a-12, the names of the parties involved
in this appeal are not disclosed. The
records and papers of this case shall be open
for inspection only to persons having a proper
interest therein and upon order of the court.

<fnt**> November 25, 2024, the date that this decision
was released as a slip opinion, is the
operative date for all substantive and procedural
purposes.

<fnt1> The court also terminated the parental
rights of Jonathan M. and John Doe, the putative
fathers of the children. Paternity of the
children has not been established. Because
neither putative father is participating in this
appeal, we refer in this opinion to the respondent
mother as the respondent.

<fnt2> The attorney for the minor children filed a
statement taking no position regarding the
issues on appeal.

<fnt3> The petitioner included with her motion an
affidavit indicating that the respondent's
whereabouts were unknown despite the department's
diligent efforts to search for the
parent, which stated: "The following efforts
were made to locate the parent: [Department
of Correction] search; Judicial search; Lexis
Nexis; certified letters sent to the last known
address; unannounced home visits to last
known address."

<fnt4> The published notice stated: "NOTICE TO:
Jessica [K.], mother of male and female child
born [in August, 2022] to Jonathan M./John
Doe. A petition has been filed seeking: Termination
of parental rights of the above named
in minor child(ren). The petition, whereby the
court's decision can affect your parental
rights, if any, regarding minor child(ren) will
be heard on 8/2/23 at 3:00 p.m. at SCJM, 7
Kendrick Ave, Waterbury, CT, 06702....
RIGHT TO COUNSEL: Upon proof of inability
to pay for a lawyer, the court will provide
one for you at court expense. Any such request
should be made immediately at the
court office where your [h]earing is to be
held."

<fnt5> The following colloquy between the court
and Bell occurred at the August 2, 2023 proceeding:

<B22>"The Court: [D]id you ever connect with
[the respondent]?

<B22>"The Witness: Yes, I have.... I talked to
her on the phone on July 20th.

<B22>"The Court: Did you tell her about today's
hearing?

<B22>"The Witness: Yes, I did."

<P20>It is not clear from the record whether Bell
had informed the respondent of the exact
date, time, location, or purpose of the hearing.

<fnt6> Although Bell had been assigned to the respondent's
case in July, 2023, one month prior
to the hearing, she testified that, after
receiving the assignment, she familiarized
herself with the respondent's case by "briefly
look[ing] through the ... case record...."
During Bell's brief testimony, which lasted
seven minutes, she discussed her July 20,
2023 phone conversation with the respondent,
noting that the respondent had requested
visitation, but further stated that, to the
best of her knowledge, the respondent had
never visited with the children, had never
provided any gifts, letters, or financial support,
and, prior to that request, had never
inquired of the department about the children's
education, health, or well-being. Bell
also indicated that she was unsure whether
the respondent was still in treatment at the
time of the August 2, 2023 proceeding because
Bell had been unable to reach the respondent
or receive information on her treatment
in subsequent calls to Rushford.

<fnt7> General Statutes &sect; 17a-112 (j) provides in
relevant part: "The Superior Court ... may
grant a petition filed pursuant to this section
if it finds by clear and convincing evidence
that (1) the [department] has made reasonable
efforts to locate the parent and to reunify the
child with the parent ... unless the court
finds in this proceeding that the parent is
unable or unwilling to benefit from reunification
efforts ... (2) termination is in the best
interest of the child, and (3) (A) the child has
been abandoned by the parent in the sense
that the parent has failed to maintain a reasonable
degree of interest, concern or responsibility
as to the welfare of the child; [or] (B)
the child (i) has been found by the Superior
Court ... to have been neglected, abused or
uncared for in a prior proceeding ... and the
parent of such child ... has failed to achieve
such degree of personal rehabilitation as
would encourage the belief that within a reasonable
time, considering the age and needs
of the child, such parent could assume a
responsible position in the life of the child
...."

<fnt8> The termination of parental rights petitions
also asserted as grounds for termination
&sect; 17a-112 (j) (3) (D) ("there is no ongoing
parent-child relationship") and (E) ("the parent
of a child under the age of seven years
who is neglected, abused or uncared for, has
failed, is unable or is unwilling to achieve
such degree of personal rehabilitation as
would encourage the belief that within a reasonable
period of time, considering the age
and needs of the child, such parent could
assume a responsible position in the life of the
child and such parent's parental rights of
another child were previously terminated pursuant
to a petition filed by the Commissioner
of Children and Families"). In rendering its
judgments at the August 2, 2023 proceeding,
the court indicated that it was "not making
findings at this time" with respect to those
grounds.

<fnt9> The court also found, as required under
&sect; 17a-112 (j) (1), that the department had
made reasonable efforts to locate the respondent
and reunify the children with the respondent
and, additionally, that the respondent
was unwilling or unable to benefit from reunification
efforts. See <EM>In re Jorden R.,</EM> 293 Conn.
539, 552-53, 979 A.2d 469 (2009) (explaining
that either finding is sufficient to satisfy statutory
requirement).

<fnt10> The court's memorandum of the August 2,
2023 proceeding stated: "Dombek can reopen
case within the next 120 days starting today
until 11/30/23 if contact information arises for
[the respondent]."

<fnt11> To set aside a default judgment, General
Statutes &sect; 52-212 (a) provides in relevant part
that the moving party must show (1) "reasonable
cause, or that a good cause of action or
defense in whole or in part existed at the time
of the rendition of the judgment" and (2)
"that the [moving party] was prevented by
mistake, accident or other reasonable cause
from ... making the defense."

<fnt12> The petitioner's written objection further
asserted that the respondent's motion also
failed to satisfy the second prong of &sect; 52-212
(a) in that it failed to show that the respondent's
absence at the August 2, 2023 proceeding
was due to "mistake, accident or other
reasonable cause." In addition, the petitioner
argued that the respondent failed to comply
with &sect; 52-212 (c) because the motion was not
verified by an oath of the respondent or her
attorney.

<fnt13> The hearing originally was scheduled for
December 12, 2023. On that date, the court
noted that the respondent, who was incarcerated
at the time, was present in the building
but that Dombek was unable to attend the
hearing due to illness. The court continued
the hearing to January 4, 2024, over the objection
of the petitioner's counsel, stating that
"it would be fundamentally unfair for the
[respondent] to proceed [as a self-represented
party] without her counsel present...."

<fnt14> The court also denied the motion to open
on the ground that the respondent had not
verified the motion under oath, as required by
statute. See General Statutes &sect; 52-212 (c).

<fnt15> A parent facing termination of his or her
parental rights "is constitutionally entitled to
the effective assistance of counsel only if he
[or she] had a constitutional right to appointed
counsel in the termination proceeding." <EM>In
re Jonathan M.,</EM> 255 Conn. 208, 225, 764 A.2d
739 (2001). On appeal, the respondent claims
only that her constitutional right to counsel
derives from the fourteenth amendment to the
federal constitution rather than any provision
of the Connecticut constitution. In <EM>Lassiter</EM> v.
<EM>Dept. of Social Services,</EM> 452 U.S. 18, 101 S.
Ct. 2153, 68 L. Ed. 2d 640 (1981), the United
States Supreme Court "declined to hold that
due process requires the appointment of
counsel whenever a state seeks to terminate
the parental rights of an indigent parent....
Instead, the court held that whether the federal
constitution requires the appointment of
counsel is a fact specific determination that
must be made ... on a case-by-case basis."
(Citation omitted.) <EM>In re Taijha H.-B.,</EM> 333
Conn. 297, 319-20, 216 A.3d 601 (2019). This
determination must be made by applying the
due process balancing test set forth in <EM>Mathews</EM>
v. <EM>Eldridge,</EM> 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S. Ct.
893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976)&mdash;that is, by
"weighing the competing private and governmental
interests at stake and the risk of an
erroneous decision in the absence of appointed
counsel...." <EM>In re Taijha H.-B.,</EM> supra, at
319, 216 A.3d 601. We assume, without deciding,
that the respondent had a constitutional
right to the effective assistance of counsel at
the termination proceeding under this framework.
We also assume, without deciding, that
the court constructively deprived her of that
right.

<fnt16> See General Statutes &sect; 46b-135 (b) ("[a]t
the commencement of any proceeding on behalf
of a neglected, uncared-for or abused
child or youth, the parent or parents or
guardian of the child or youth shall have the
right to counsel, and ... if they are unable to
afford counsel, counsel will be provided for
them"); General Statutes &sect; 45a-717 (b) (at
hearing on petition for termination of parental
rights, "the court shall inform [the] respondent
parent of his or her right to counsel
and upon request, if he or she is unable to pay
for counsel, shall appoint counsel to represent
such respondent parent").

<fnt17> See <EM>In re Amias I.,</EM> supra, 343 Conn. at
839, 276 A.3d 955 ("[a]lthough this court has
recognized that structural error can occur
outside the criminal context ... to the best of
our knowledge, we have never applied it in
the child dependency context" (citation omitted));
see also <EM>In re Gabriel S.,</EM> 347 Conn.
223, 237-38, 296 A.3d 829 (2023) (stating
that, even if it had concluded that trial court
violated respondent parent's due process
right to adequate notice of grounds for terminating
his parental rights, respondent's claim
failed because record indicated that such violation
would be harmless beyond reasonable
doubt); <EM>In re Amias I.,</EM> supra, at 839, 276
A.3d 955 (declining to apply structural error
doctrine in context of termination proceeding
where respondent parent claimed that trial
court violated her children's constitutional
right to conflict free counsel by failing to
inquire into whether their attorney had conflict
of interest); <EM>In re Elvin G.,</EM> 310 Conn.
485, 507 n.20, 78 A.3d 797 (2013) (disagreeing
with contention that structural error doctrine
should apply where trial court failed to
provide statutorily required specific steps to
parent in termination of parental rights proceeding
when record sufficiently demonstrated
that alleged error was harmless).

<fnt18> We further note that, although other states
have applied <EM>Cronic</EM>'s presumption of prejudice
to child protection cases, our Supreme
Court precedent does not support a finding of
structural error where, as we conclude here,
"the effects of the error are quantifiable and
... [the] court can determine beyond a reasonable
doubt that the error was harmless."
<EM>In re Amias I.,</EM> supra, 343 Conn. at 839, 276
A.3d 955.

<fnt19> The respondent filed the motion to open on
November 8, 2023, roughly two months prior
to the January 4, 2024 hearing on the motion.

<fnt20> We note that, on appeal, the respondent
asserts that "[Dombek] was led to believe that
her motion to open, which did not rely on
[Practice Book] &sect; 35a-18 or &sect; 52-212, would
be granted automatically if she were able to
locate the respondent and timely moved to
open the termination judgment." Accordingly,
although the respondent concedes that the
purpose of a motion to open pursuant to &sect; 52-212
is to provide a defaulted party with the
opportunity to be heard, she nonetheless argues
that her "rights to due process could not
have been vindicated" by the motion to open
in this case because "her attorney was not
aware that the court would require" the respondent,
pursuant to her motion to open, to
present a good defense to the termination
petitions. (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

<P20>In light of the record before us, however,
we cannot agree that the respondent's failure
to avail herself of the opportunity to be heard
pursuant to her motion to open can be attributed
to her counsel's interpretation of the
requirements to prevail on that motion. Section
52-212 and the corresponding rule of
practice, Practice Book &sect; 35a-18, expressly
make clear the evidentiary requirements a
party must satisfy when filing a motion to
open. Although the court did not set forth
these requirements expressly at the August 2,
2023 proceeding or in its corresponding
memorandum of decision, we agree with the
petitioner that the court also did not indicate
that the respondent would be entitled to open
the judgments as a matter of right or that she
would otherwise be relieved of those statutory
requirements. We further note that, although
the respondent's motion to open did not reference
&sect; 52-212, the petitioner's written objection
to the motion, which it filed one day after
the respondent's motion was filed and two
months prior to the January 4, 2024 hearing,
should have put the respondent on notice of
the statutory requirements she needed to satisfy
to prevail on her motion to open. See
footnote 12 of this opinion. Moreover, at the
January 4, 2024 hearing on the motion to
open, the court, before ruling on the motion,
expressly stated that the respondent has the
burden of showing "a valid defense as to the
grounds for abandonment and failure to rehabilitate
...." We note that, in response to the
court's statement, Dombek did not claim to be
unaware of this requirement or argue that the
requirement did not apply to the respondent's
motion to open, nor did Dombek request or
indicate that she needed additional time to
present evidence of a good defense. Accordingly,
although the respondent argues on appeal
that the failure to present evidence of a
good defense was because Dombek "was not
prepared to put on [such] evidence" at the
January 4, 2024 hearing, we conclude that the
record before us does not support the respondent's
claim.

<fnt21> The respondent also argues that, "even if
[she] did not have a defense, at [the] termination
trial she would have [had] the opportunity
to challenge the testimony of the
witnesses and the evidence sought to be admitted,
which could [have] cause[d] the
court to find that the petitioner had failed
to meet her burden, despite the respondent
not putting forth a defense." We note, however,
that, although the respondent contends
that "[f]acts found in the absence of due
process are inherently unreliable," she concedes
that she has not challenged any of
the court's factual findings as clearly erroneous,
nor does she challenge the reliability,
accuracy, or admissibility of any specific
evidence the petitioner presented at the August
2, 2023 proceeding.

<fnt22> Because we conclude that the respondent's
proffered evidence would not have affected
the court's finding of abandonment as a
ground for termination, it is not necessary for
us to determine whether such evidence could
have affected the court's finding of failure to
rehabilitate as a ground for termination. See
<EM>In re Brea B.,</EM> 75 Conn. App. 466, 473, 816
A.2d 707 (2003) ("Because the statutory
grounds necessary to grant a petition for termination
of parental rights are expressed in
the disjunctive, the court need find only one
ground to grant the petition. Thus, we may
affirm the court's decision if we find that it
properly concluded that any one of the statutory
circumstances existed.").

<fnt23> Dombek stated only that she would "like a
little bit of an opportunity to try to track [the
respondent] to see where she's at."

<fnt24> The respondent claims that she "advanced
a due process argument [at trial] that can be
expanded upon on appeal to encompass the
other due process claims" she raises on appeal.
Dombek, however, did not raise a due
process claim at the August 2, 2023 termination
proceeding, and, although she stated at
the January 4, 2024 hearing on the motion to
open that the respondent has a "due process
right" to raise her children, Dombek did not
argue specifically that the denial of the continuance
violated the respondent's due process
rights. Accordingly, to the extent that the
respondent contends that her due process
claims were preserved before the trial court,
we disagree. See <EM>In re Kiara Liz V.,</EM> 203 Conn.
App. 613, 621 n.8, 248 A.3d 813, cert. denied,
337 Conn. 904, 252 A.3d 364 (2021).

<fnt25> In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful
of the compelling interests that are at
stake in proceedings to terminate parental
rights, including the strong public interest in
the prompt resolution of these cases. However,
we emphasize that a respondent in a termination
of parental rights proceeding has a
statutory right to the effective assistance of
counsel, and when assigned counsel is appointed
just days before a termination hearing
and has not had an opportunity to speak with
his or her client, and counsel makes a reasonable
request for a continuance, the trial court
ordinarily should strongly consider granting
that request. This is especially the case where,
as here, counsel had obtained new information
as to how to contact the client with
whom she previously had been unable to
communicate. In the present case, the record
reflects no compelling reason as to why the
request was denied. We conclude, however,
for the reasons stated herein, that the denial
of counsel's request for a continuance was
harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

<fnt26> Although the respondent concedes that she
did not advance a claim of inadequate notice
before the trial court, she again argues that
she "advanced a due process argument [at
trial] that can be expanded upon on appeal to
encompass" the notice claim she raises on
appeal. It is clear from the record before us,
however, that to the extent the respondent
advanced a due process argument before the
trial court, that argument never challenged
the constitutionality nor the adequacy of the
court's notice specifically. See footnote 24 of
this opinion. We therefore conclude that the
respondent did not preserve the due process
claim regarding notice that she raises on appeal.

<fnt27> We note that "[n]otice by publication, although
sometimes necessary, is not the preferred
method for assuring full participation
in so significant an impairment of constitutionally
protected parental rights." <EM>In re Baby
Girl B.,</EM> 224 Conn. 263, 295, 618 A.2d 1
(1992). Although the record indicates that the
respondent's whereabouts were unknown on
July 11, 2023, the date that the petitioner
filed, and the court granted, the motion for
notice by publication, the record also indicates
that on the date of publication, July 20,
2023, Bell spoke with the respondent on the
phone after learning that the respondent was
in a detoxification treatment program at
Rushford. Thereafter, on July 26, 2023, the
respondent applied for the appointment of
counsel, indicating that she had just been
released from the hospital and listing her
address as a homeless shelter. We note that
between the July 20, 2023 phone call and the
August 2, 2023 hearing, at which the court
found the published notice to be appropriate
and sufficient, it does not appear that the
petitioner made any efforts to serve the respondent
either at Rushford or at the homeless
shelter she listed as her address on her
application for counsel. Although we do not
reach the merits of the respondent's claim
under <EM>Golding</EM>'s third prong&mdash;that is, whether
notice was constitutionally insufficient and
deprived the respondent of a fair trial&mdash;we
emphasize that "[t]he purpose of the notice in
this case was to inform the mother of the
hearing regarding the termination of her parental
rights. Notice is not a mere perfunctory
act in order to satisfy the technicalities of a
statute, but has, as its basis, constitutional
dimensions. An elementary and fundamental
requirement of due process in any proceeding
which is to be accorded finality is notice
reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances,
to apprise interested parties of the
pendency of the action and afford them an
opportunity to present their objections." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 295-96,
618 A.2d 1.

<P20>The petitioner, Frantz Cator, appeals
from the judgment of the habeas court
denying his third amended petition for a
writ of habeas corpus (operative petition).
The petitioner claims that the court abused
its discretion by denying him certification
to appeal from its judgment (1) dismissing
the first and third counts of his operative
petition, which alleged due process violations
and ineffective assistance of trial
counsel, respectively; (2) rejecting his
<Page 1034>
claim that he was improperly excluded
from a critical stage of the proceedings
during his criminal trial; (3) concluding
that he had failed to establish that his first
habeas counsel
<SPage 395>
rendered ineffective assistance
by failing to plead and prove a
<EM>Brady</EM><fnr1> claim and that he had been excluded
from a critical stage of his criminal
trial; and (4) determining that he had
failed to demonstrate that his second and
third habeas counsel were ineffective for
failing to plead and prove the aforementioned
ineffectiveness claims against his
first habeas counsel. Although we agree
with the petitioner that the habeas court
abused its discretion in denying him certification
to appeal, we affirm the court's
judgment on its merits.

<P20>The following facts and procedural history
are relevant to this appeal. On October
21, 1997, following a jury trial, the petitioner
was convicted of felony murder in violation
of General Statutes &sect; 53a-54c,<fnr2> murder
in violation of General Statutes &sect; 53a-54a
(a), conspiracy to commit murder in violation
of General Statutes &sect;&sect; 53a-48 and 53a-54a
(a), kidnapping in the second degree in
violation of General Statutes &sect; 53a-94 (a),
conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the
second degree in violation of &sect;&sect; 53a-48 and
53a-94 (a), and his sentence was enhanced
for the commission of a class A, B or C
felony with a firearm in violation of General
Statutes &sect; 53-202k. On March 6, 1998,
the court, <EM>Ford, J.,</EM> sentenced the petitioner
to fifty-five years of incarceration, suspended
after fifty years, followed by five
years of probation. The state then moved
to correct the petitioner's sentence on the
ground that the imposition of probation
was improper and that the proper calculation
of the petitioner's total effective sentence
was sixty-five years. The court
granted the motion and, on October 8,
1999, corrected the petitioner's total effective
sentence to fifty years of incarceration
without any period
<SPage 396>
of probation. The
petitioner appealed to our Supreme Court,
which reversed the trial court's judgment
in part and remanded the case to that
court with direction to vacate the petitioner's
conviction under &sect; 53-202k, and to
merge his conspiracy convictions and to
impose a single sentence on those counts.
See <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Cator,</EM> 256 Conn. 785, 812-13,
781 A.2d 285 (2001). On May 13, 2003,
pursuant to the court's remand order, the
petitioner was resentenced to a total effective
sentence of forty-five years of incarceration.

<P20>The jury reasonably could have found
the following facts, as stated by our Supreme
Court in the petitioner's direct appeal.
"Desmond Hamilton, [the petitioner]
and the victim, Nathaniel Morris, all knew
each other and had participated in the sale
of drugs together. On May 10, 1996, on
Laurel Court, a dead-end street in Bridgeport,
[the petitioner] and Hamilton had a
discussion concerning both money that
Hamilton owed [the petitioner] and a gun
of [the petitioner's] that he had given to
Hamilton approximately two weeks earlier.
Also present during the conversation were
the victim, and McWarren St. Julien. [The
petitioner] also questioned the victim about
the whereabouts of the gun. During the
conversation, [the petitioner] became upset,
began yelling and pulled out a Glock
.40 handgun. Police officers subsequently
came to the location of the conversation,
but when they arrived [the petitioner] was
no longer there. Later that night, Hamilton
called [the petitioner] to attempt to
explain that he did not know where the
gun was located, and that he would never
<Page 1035>
steal from [the petitioner]. [The petitioner]
told Hamilton that he wanted him `to get
everything straight.'

<P20>"On the following day, May 11, 1996,
Hamilton again called [the petitioner], who
told Hamilton that he was going to meet
Hamilton at Hamilton's mother's house,
and that the two men would go together to
find the victim to learn what had happened
to the gun. Later
<SPage 397>
that evening, [the
petitioner] picked up Hamilton and they
proceeded to 244 Olive Street in Bridgeport,
where Hamilton, the victim, Tamara
Addison and Terrance Addison lived. At
244 Olive Street, [the petitioner], the victim,
St. Julien, Hamilton, Hamilton's mother,
Tamara Addison and Terrance Addison
were on the front porch of the house.
There [the petitioner] asked the victim
about the whereabouts of his gun that had
been the topic of the May 10 discussion. At
or about the same time, Rodolphe St. Victor
arrived at the house. [The petitioner]
and St. Julien then left the porch as St.
Victor forcibly pulled the victim off the
porch. As [the petitioner] and St. Julien
proceeded to enter a blue Oldsmobile
parked in the driveway of the house, St.
Victor grabbed the victim by the sleeve
and said `Come on. [The petitioner] wants
to talk to you.' St. Victor then forced the
victim into the Oldsmobile, which [the petitioner]
then drove away. People at the
house contacted the Bridgeport police out
of concern for the victim's safety. The
police came to the house and, after speaking
with the people there, left in search of
the blue Oldsmobile. Later that evening,
[the petitioner], St. Julien and St. Victor
returned to 244 Olive Street in the blue
Oldsmobile. The police arrived shortly
thereafter and arrested the three occupants
of the vehicle and recovered a gun
from it. [The petitioner], St. Julien and St.
Victor then were taken to the Bridgeport
police station. Thereafter, St. Victor and
three Bridgeport police detectives left the
Bridgeport police station and St. Victor
directed the police to Suggetts Lane,
Bridgeport, where the victim was found,
conscious but unable to speak, with a gunshot
wound to the back of his neck. The
police summoned medical personnel, who
took the victim to Bridgeport Hospital,
where he died. Tests conducted on the gun
recovered from the car revealed that the
bullet that killed the victim had been fired
from it. The murder weapon was a Mac-10
automatic pistol
<SPage 398>
modified with a shell
catcher to retain spent bullet casings and a
handle to prevent shaking when the gun
was fired rapidly. This weapon belonged to
[the petitioner], and he often carried it
with him." Id. at 789-91, 781 A.2d 285.

<P20>St. Victor and St. Julien were also
prosecuted for their involvement in the
victim's death. Following a jury trial, St.
Victor was convicted of one count of conspiracy
to commit kidnapping in the first
degree in violation of &sect;&sect; 53a-48 and 53a-92
(a) (2) (A), and acquitted on one count of
kidnapping in the first degree in violation
of &sect; 53a-92 (a) (2) (A). The day after the
petitioner's conviction, St. Julien pleaded
guilty under the <EM>Alford</EM> doctrine<fnr3> to conspiracy
to commit kidnapping in the second
degree in violation of &sect;&sect; 53a-48 and
53a-94 (a). A fourth codefendant, Peter
Johnson, was also arrested and prosecuted
for the murder of the victim but was acquitted
on all charges<fnr4> after a jury trial on
March 2, 2001.

success, litigated three other petitions

June 12, 2017, and filed the operative eight
count amended petition on September 28,
2021.

<P20>In his operative petition, the petitioner
alleged: (1) his due process rights had
been violated in his underlying criminal
prosecution as a result of, inter alia, the
prosecution's suppression of various pieces
of exculpatory evidence; (2) he had been
excluded from a critical stage of the prosecution;
(3) his trial counsel, Kevin A. Randolph,<fnr7>
had rendered ineffective assistance;
(4) he was actually innocent of the offenses
of which he had been convicted; (5) his
first habeas counsel, Robert J. McKay, had
rendered ineffective assistance by failing
to adequately plead, argue and prove the
claims set forth in counts one through
four; (6) his second habeas counsel, Thomas
P. Mullaney III, had rendered ineffective
assistance by failing to plead, argue
and prove the claims set forth in counts
one through five; (7) his third habeas counsel,
Jason C. Goddard and Freesia Waldron,
had rendered ineffective assistance
by failing to plead, argue and prove the
claims set forth in counts one through six
and in count eight; and (8) his sentence
violated his
<SPage 400>
rights to due process and to
be free from cruel and unusual punishment.<fnr8>
He requested that the habeas court
vacate the underlying criminal judgment
and sentence and order "whatever other
relief that law and justice require."

<P20>The habeas court, <EM>Newson, J.,</EM> held a
trial on the petition on October 24 and
December 19, 2022. The petitioner presented
testimony from C. Robert Satti, Jr.,
the prosecuting attorney in his underlying
criminal trial; Suzanne Zitser, who had
represented the petitioner on direct appeal;
Randolph; McKay; Mullaney; Goddard;
<Page 1037>
and two expert witnesses, Attorneys
Vishal K. Garg and Frank J. Riccio. The
petitioner also submitted more than fifty
exhibits into evidence. The respondent, the
Commissioner of Correction, submitted no
exhibits and called no witnesses.

<P20>On December 19, 2022, the court sua
sponte ordered the parties to submit memoranda
of law as to whether the court
should dismiss one or both of counts one
and four of the operative petition (which
alleged due process violations and actual
innocence, respectively) on the ground of
res judicata pursuant to Practice Book
&sect; 23-29 (3).<fnr9> The petitioner and the respondent
filed supplemental briefs on February
3, 2023, in response to the court's order.
On February 23, 2023, the court, sua
sponte, further ordered that the parties
were permitted to submit supplemental
briefs as to why it should
<SPage 401>
not dismiss
count three (which alleged ineffective assistance
of trial counsel) pursuant to &sect; 23-29
(3) and (5). On March 24, 2023, the
petitioner filed an objection to the court's
notice of its possible dismissal of his petition
in its entirety or of only count three;
the respondent did not file any further
supplemental briefing on the issue.

<P20>On March 29, 2023, the habeas court
issued a memorandum of decision dismissing
counts one, three, and four of the
operative petition. It denied the petition
with respect to the remaining counts. The
petitioner subsequently filed a petition for
certification to appeal to this court, which
the habeas court denied on April 10, 2023.
This appeal followed. Additional facts and
procedural history will be set forth as necessary.

<P20>We begin with our well established
standard for review of a denial of a
petition for certification to appeal. "Faced
with the habeas court's denial of certification
to appeal, a petitioner's first burden is
to demonstrate that the habeas court's ruling
constituted an abuse of discretion....
A petitioner may establish an abuse of
discretion by demonstrating that the issues
are debatable among jurists of reason
... [a] court could resolve the issues [in a
different manner] ... or ... the questions
are adequate to deserve encouragement to
proceed further.... The required determination
may be made on the basis of the
record before the habeas court and applicable
legal principles.... If the petitioner
succeeds in surmounting that hurdle, the
petitioner must then demonstrate that the
judgment of the habeas court should be
reversed on its merits....

<P20>"In determining whether the habeas
court abused its discretion in denying
the petitioner's request for certification,
we necessarily must consider the merits of
the petitioner's underlying [claim] to determine
whether
<SPage 402>
the habeas court reasonably
determined that the petitioner's
appeal was frivolous. In other words, we
review the petitioner's substantive [claim]
for the purpose of ascertaining whether
[that claim satisfies] one or more of the
three criteria ... adopted by [our Supreme
Court] for determining the propriety
of the habeas court's denial of the
petition for certification." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Hilton</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 225 Conn. App. 309,
332-33, 315 A.3d 1135 (2024).
<Page 1038>

<P20>As we explain in part I of this opinion,
we agree with the petitioner that the habeas
court improperly dismissed count one of
the operative petition on the ground of res
judicata. Accordingly, we necessarily conclude
that a court could resolve the issues
in a different manner and that the habeas
court thus abused its discretion in denying
certification to appeal. We therefore address
the petitioner's claims on their merits.
See, e.g., <EM>Williams</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of
Correction,</EM> 221 Conn. App. 294, 303, 301
A.3d 1136 (2023).

<CN>I

<P20>The petitioner first claims that the habeas
court erroneously dismissed counts one
and three of his operative petition and
requests a remand for a trial on the merits
of both counts.<fnr10> We agree that the habeas
court erroneously dismissed count one. We
disagree, however, that the habeas court
erroneously dismissed count three. We further
conclude that a remand for a trial on
the merits of count one is not necessary
because an alternative ground exists for
denying that count.

<P20>The following additional facts and procedural
history are relevant to this claim. In
count one of his operative
<SPage 403>
petition, the
petitioner alleged that his right to due
process under the state and federal constitutions
had been violated in his underlying
criminal prosecution. In particular, he
claimed that the state improperly had
withheld various pieces of material, exculpatory
evidence, namely: "(i) that the petitioner's
[codefendant] St. Julien, gave a
written and recorded statement to the police
that was favorable to the petitioner's
defense;<fnr11> (ii) that St. Julien testified in
[<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Johnson,</EM> Superior Court, Docket
No. CR-97-0135375-T, 1999 WL 1566479
(Conn. Super. Dec. 23, 1999)], in a manner
that was favorable to the petitioner's defense;
(iii) that William Kamper<fnr12> and Terrance
Addison testified in [<EM>Johnson</EM>] in a
manner that was inconsistent with their
testimony in [the petitioner's trial] and
favorable to the petitioner's defense;
and/or (iv) information about [Kamper],
[Hamilton], Terrance Addison, and Tamara
Addison that could have been used by the
petitioner to impeach their testimony in
[his own trial] on the basis of bias and/or
motive to fabricate...." (Footnotes added.)
He also claimed that the state had
procured his conviction "by presenting a
theory of the case that was materially
inconsistent" with the evidence it had used
in the prosecution of Johnson.

<P20>In the petitioner's first habeas petition,
which sought identical relief to that sought
in his operative petition in the present
case,<fnr13> he presented a claim of prosecutorial
<SPage 404>
impropriety,
predicated on an allegation
that Satti had made unjustified statements
and expressed personal opinions to
<Page 1039>
the jury.<fnr14> Following the close of evidence
in his first habeas trial, the petitioner withdrew
his prosecutorial impropriety claim
on the record after consulting with his
attorney. In its memorandum of decision,
the first habeas court "[found] that [the
prosecutorial impropriety claim was] withdrawn
with prejudice." <EM>Cator</EM> v. <EM>Warden,</EM>
supra, 2004 WL 503831, *1 n.1.

<P20>In the present action, the habeas court
dismissed count one of the operative petition
on the ground of res judicata. The
court characterized count one as also alleging
prosecutorial impropriety; determined
that the factual predicates of the allegations
in count one could have been discovered
by due diligence prior to the conclusion
of the first habeas trial; and concluded
that, because the first habeas court had
found that the petitioner's prosecutorial
impropriety claim was withdrawn with
prejudice, and both the first habeas petition
and the operative petition sought the
same relief, res judicata barred the petitioner
from litigating a second "prosecutorial
impropriety" claim in the present proceeding.

<P20>Despite its dismissal of count one, however,
the habeas court also considered and
rejected the petitioner's due process claims
in count one on the merits. Specifically, the
court addressed the claim regarding St.
Julien's statement to the police in the context
of the petitioner's claim of ineffective
assistance of his first habeas counsel. The
court concluded that the statement was not
material to the petitioner's guilt or innocence
and, thus, that the petitioner was not
prejudiced by his first habeas counsel's
failure to plead a claim under <EM>Brady</EM> v.
<EM>Maryland,</EM> 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194,
10
<SPage 405>
L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), predicated on
the statement's suppression. The court
also concluded that St. Julien's testimony
in Johnson's trial had not been "suppressed"
because it was given in the
course of a public proceeding. It further
determined that the petitioner had failed
to present sufficient evidence to substantiate
his claims regarding Kamper, Hamilton,
and Terrance and Tamara Addison&mdash;
in significant part because the petitioner
had not called any of these individuals to
testify at his habeas trial. Finally, it concluded
that the theories of prosecution
used against the petitioner and Johnson
were not materially inconsistent.<fnr15>

<P20>In count three of his operative petition,
the petitioner alleged that his criminal trial
counsel, Randolph, had rendered ineffective
assistance. Specifically, he claimed
that Randolph had failed to raise and argue
the claim in count two of the operative
petition (exclusion from a critical stage of
the proceedings); "failed to adequately
present and argue the claim that Attorney
[Joseph] Mirsky [the petitioner's first
criminal trial counsel] had a conflict of
interest when he represented both the petitioner
and St. Julien during pretrial proceedings
... failed to object to the trial
court's instruction to the jury that it could
find the petitioner guilty of murder based
on a theory of coconspirator vicarious liability
... failed to object to the trial
court's jury instruction ... and/or failed to
ask the court to poll the jury regarding the
theory under which it found the petitioner
guilty of murder ... failed to adequately
cross-examine or otherwise impeach the
testimony of [Terrance Addison, Tamara
Addison, Kamper, and Hamilton]....
<Page 1040>
failed to adequately investigate and/or call
the following witnesses to testify [Tyler
Bember, Patricia Bember,
<SPage 406>
Effrain Johnson
and St. Julien] ... failed to adequately
investigate the facts and circumstances of
the petitioner's whereabouts, conduct, and
interactions on May 11, 1996, prior to his
arrival at 244 Olive Street ... failed to
adequately cross-examine and/or otherwise
impeach the testimony of Edward McPhillips<fnr16>
... failed to object to the trial
court's inaccurate and/or misleading jury
instruction on the issue of specific intent
... and ... failed to move for a mistrial
and/or disqualification based on the trial
court's participation in discussions regarding
a plea offer." (Footnote added.)

<P20>The habeas court also dismissed count
three on the ground of res judicata. It
explained that, in his first habeas petition,
the petitioner had also presented an ineffective
assistance of counsel claim against
Randolph, though predicated on different
factual allegations. The first habeas court
denied that claim on the merits. See <EM>Cator</EM>
v. <EM>Warden,</EM> supra, 2004 WL 503831, *7-8.
The habeas court in the present case concluded
that "all of the matters alleged in
the current petition relate directly to information
and witnesses that were known, or
should have been known, through the exercise
of due diligence ... when the [first
habeas] petition went to trial." It further
concluded that, because the first habeas
petition had also raised a claim of ineffective
assistance of trial counsel and sought
the same relief as the operative petition in
the present case, count three was barred
by res judicata.

<P20>Before examining the merits of
the habeas court's dismissals of each
count, we set forth the principles governing
the application of res judicata in the
habeas context. "The doctrine of res judicata
provides that a former judgment
serves as an absolute bar to a subsequent
action involving any claims relating to such
cause
<SPage 407>
of action which were actually
made or which might have been made....
The doctrine ... applies to criminal as
well as civil proceedings and to state habeas
corpus proceedings.... However,
[u]nique policy considerations must be taken
into account in applying the doctrine of
res judicata to a constitutional claim raised
by a habeas petitioner.... Specifically, in
the habeas context, in the interest of ensuring
that no one is deprived of liberty in
violation of his or her constitutional rights
... the application of the doctrine of res
judicata ... [is limited] to claims that have
actually been raised and litigated in an
earlier proceeding....

<P20>"In the context of a habeas action,
a court must determine whether a petitioner
actually has raised a new legal ground
for relief or only has alleged different factual
allegations in support of a previously
litigated claim.... Identical grounds may
be proven by different factual allegations,
supported by different legal arguments or
articulated in different language.... They
raise, however, the same generic legal basis
for the same relief....

<P20>"[A] subsequent petition alleging
the same ground as a previously denied
petition will elude dismissal if it alleges
grounds not actually litigated in the
earlier petition and if it alleges new facts
or proffers new evidence not reasonably
available at the time of the earlier petition....
In this context, a ground has
been defined as sufficient legal basis for
granting the relief sought." (Citations

203 Conn. App. 752, 762-63, 250 A.3d
731, cert. denied, 336 Conn. 946, 251 A.3d
77 (2021). Whether a habeas court properly
<Page 1041>
dismissed a claim on the ground of res
judicata is a question of law over which our
review is plenary. See, e.g., <EM>Kelsey</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 343 Conn. 424,
435-36, 274 A.3d 85 (2022).
<SPage 408>

<CN>A

<P20>The petitioner argues that the habeas
court improperly concluded that
count one of the operative petition was
barred by res judicata. The respondent
does not challenge this argument in his
brief, and, at oral argument before this
court, counsel for the respondent conceded
that the habeas court had incorrectly applied
the doctrine of res judicata to count
one. We agree with the petitioner.

<P20>Contrary to the habeas court's
conclusion, count one of the operative petition
does not present a claim of "prosecutorial
impropriety," as that claim has been
defined by our courts. To prevail on a
claim of prosecutorial impropriety, a petitioner
must show that there was improper
conduct by the prosecutor and that such
conduct deprived him of his due process
right to a fair trial. See, e.g., <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>Brown,</EM> 345 Conn. 354, 384-85, 285 A.3d
367 (2022). In determining whether conduct
by the prosecutor violated the petitioner's
right to a fair trial, a court must
conduct a multifactor analysis that considers
the extent to which the improper conduct
was invited by the defense; the severity
of the improper conduct; the frequency
of the improper conduct; the centrality of
the improper conduct to the critical issues
in the case; the strength of any curative
measures adopted; and the strength of the
state's case. See, e.g., <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Warholic,</EM>
278 Conn. 354, 361, 897 A.2d 569 (2006).

<P20>In count one of the operative
petition, the petitioner claimed that the
prosecutor in the underlying criminal case
violated the petitioner's due process rights
by (1) suppressing material, exculpatory
evidence, and (2) relying on inconsistent
theories of guilt to convict the petitioner
and a codefendant. Neither of these claims
constitutes the same "ground" as prosecutorial
impropriety because each claim requires
a court to conduct
<SPage 409>
a distinct inquiry
under a distinct legal standard. See,
e.g., <EM>Diaz</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
125 Conn. App. 57, 66, 6 A.3d 213 (2010)
(claims that require separate legal analyses
are not identical for purposes of res
judicata), cert. denied, 299 Conn. 926, 11
A.3d 150 (2011); see also <EM>Thorpe</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 73 Conn. App.
773, 778, 809 A.2d 1126 (2002). To prevail
on a claim that the prosecutor suppressed
exculpatory evidence, a petitioner must
show that the prosecutor suppressed evidence,
that the evidence was favorable to
the defense and that the evidence was
material. See, e.g., <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Ouellette,</EM> 295
Conn. 173, 185, 989 A.2d 1048 (2010). In
determining whether a prosecutor violated
a defendant's right to due process by relying
on inconsistent theories of guilt across
related cases, a court must examine the
state's arguments in each case to determine
whether inconsistencies between
them&mdash;if any&mdash;are inherent to the state's
theory or whether the varying material
facts are irreconcilable. See <EM>Council</EM> v.
<EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 114 Conn.
App. 99, 111-12, 968 A.2d 483, cert. denied,
292 Conn. 918, 973 A.2d 1275 (2009).
Though, to be sure&mdash;at a high level of
generality&mdash;these claims require a court to
assess the conduct of the state in conducting
a criminal prosecution, they are not
thereby interchangeable with a prosecutorial
impropriety claim, which has a specific
meaning under Connecticut law. We therefore
conclude that the habeas court erroneously
dismissed count one of the petition
on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata.<fnr17>
<Page 1042>

<CN>B

<P20>The petitioner also argues that
the habeas court's conclusion that count
three was barred by res judicata was erroneous.
We disagree.<fnr18>
<SPage 410>

<P20>Although the petitioner acknowledges
having previously litigated a
claim of ineffective assistance against Randolph
in his first habeas action, he argues
that the ineffectiveness claim in count
three of the operative petition should not
have been dismissed on the ground of res
judicata because the specific factual allegations
that he raised in his operative petition
were not pleaded, litigated, or decided
on the merits in his first or any other
habeas petition. This court, however, has
"rejected this argument on numerous occasions."
<EM>Tatum</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
211 Conn. App. 42, 50, 272 A.3d 218
(2022), rev'd in part on other grounds, 349
Conn. 733, 322 A.3d 299 (2024). Even if a
subsequent petition sets forth different
specific factual allegations to support a
claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel,
the claim remains the same for res
judicata purposes so long as the petitioner
seeks the same relief and does not allege
newly available facts or evidence not reasonably
available at the time of the prior
petition. See id. at 51-53, 272 A.3d 218; see
also, e.g., <EM>Damato</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
156 Conn. App. 165, 174, 113 A.3d
449 ("[a]lthough we recognize that the petitioner
sets forth <EM>different allegations</EM> in
support of his claim of ineffective assistance,
the claim is still one of ineffective
assistance of counsel involving [trial counsel]"
(emphasis in original)), cert. denied,
317 Conn. 902, 114 A.3d 167 (2015). The
petitioner does not dispute that his current
habeas petition seeks the same relief as
that sought in his first petition, nor does
he challenge the habeas court's conclusion
that his allegations "relate directly to information
and witnesses that were known,
or should have been known, through the
exercise in due diligence ... when the
[first habeas] petition went to trial." As
such, we agree with the habeas court that
the petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance
against Randolph is improperly successive.
<SPage 411>

<P20>The petitioner insists that it
was nonetheless improper for the habeas
court to dismiss his ineffectiveness claim
against Randolph because, to prevail on
his claims of ineffective assistance of habeas
counsel (counts five through seven), he
necessarily had to prove that Randolph,
his trial counsel, was also ineffective. Although
it is true that a petitioner seeking
to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance
of habeas counsel must establish
both that his appointed habeas counsel and
trial counsel were ineffective; see, e.g.,
<EM>Harris</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 108
Conn. App. 201, 206, 947 A.2d 435, cert.
denied, 288 Conn. 911, 953 A.2d 652 (2008);
it does not follow that the res judicata
dismissal of a freestanding count of ineffective
assistance of trial counsel automatically
precludes a petitioner from proceeding
on, and prevailing on the merits of, a
separate claim of ineffective assistance of
habeas counsel.

<P20>This court's decision in <EM>Kearney</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 113 Conn. App.
223, 965 A.2d 608 (2009), is directly on
point. In <EM>Kearney,</EM> the petitioner brought
<Page 1043>
a second habeas petition in which he alleged
ineffective assistance of his trial
counsel and ineffective assistance of his
first habeas counsel. Id. at 226-27, 965
A.2d 608. In his first habeas petition, the
petitioner had also pleaded ineffective assistance
of trial counsel, though without all
of the same underlying factual allegations
as were contained in his second petition.
Id. at 230-31, 965 A.2d 608. The second
habeas court dismissed the petitioner's
claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel
as barred by res judicata, and this
court upheld that dismissal on appeal for
the same reason that we uphold the dismissal
of count three in the present case.
See id. at 233, 965 A.2d 608. The second
habeas court in <EM>Kearney,</EM> however, further
concluded that, because the petitioner's
claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel
was foreclosed, his claim of ineffective
assistance of habeas counsel must necessarily
be dismissed as well because the
latter claim required
<SPage 412>
the petitioner to
prove ineffective assistance of trial counsel.
See id. at 237-38, 965 A.2d 608. This
court rejected that argument, holding that,
under our Supreme Court's decision in <EM>Lozada</EM>
v. <EM>Warden,</EM> 223 Conn. 834, 844, 613
A.2d 818 (1992)&mdash;which had held that
"[t]he claim of ineffective assistance of habeas
counsel, when added to the claim of
ineffective assistance of trial counsel, results
in a different issue"&mdash;a habeas petitioner
"is entitled to make a claim that he
or she was deprived of effective habeas
counsel in a prior petition ... [and] such a
claim is not subject to dismissal on the
ground that an earlier habeas petition that
was based on the ineffectiveness of trial
counsel had been unsuccessful." <EM>Kearney</EM>
v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> supra, at
239, 965 A.2d 608. As such, the petitioner's
argument&mdash;that count three should not
have been dismissed because he was required
to separately plead ineffective assistance
of trial counsel in order to prevail
on his claims of ineffective assistance of
habeas counsel&mdash;is unavailing.

<CN>C

<P20>The petitioner argues that, because
count one was improperly dismissed,
he is entitled to a remand to the habeas
court for further proceedings on the merits
of that count. Though we agree, for the
reasons set forth in part I A of this opinion,
that the habeas court's reasoning in
dismissing count one was erroneous, we
disagree that a remand is appropriate because
the court's judgment as to count one
may be affirmed on an alternative basis.

<P20>"[If] the trial court reaches a correct
decision but on [improper] grounds,
this court has repeatedly sustained the
trial court's action if proper grounds exist
to support it.... [W]e ... may affirm the
court's judgment on a dispositive alternative
ground for which there is support in
the trial court record." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>Green Tree Servicing,
LLC</EM> v. <EM>Clark,</EM> 224 Conn.
<SPage 413>
App. 740, 748,
314 A.3d 1019, cert. denied, 349 Conn. 913,
315 A.3d 300 (2024); see also <EM>Ross</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 337 Conn. 718,
733, 256 A.3d 118 (2021) (concluding that
Appellate Court improperly determined
that ineffective assistance claim was
barred by collateral estoppel but nonetheless
affirming judgment on alternative
ground that petitioner failed to demonstrate
prejudice).

<P20>As we have explained, notwithstanding
its dismissal of count one, the
habeas court also rejected on the merits
the various due process allegations pleaded
in count one. Although a court's dismissal
of a claim on jurisdictional grounds deprives
it of jurisdiction to consider the
merits of that claim, and any further discussion
of those merits constitutes dicta;
see, e.g., <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Despres,</EM> 220 Conn. App.
<Page 1044>
612, 624 n.9, 300 A.3d 637 (2023); a conclusion
that a claim is barred by res judicata
does not implicate the court's jurisdiction.
See, e.g., <EM>M&T Bank</EM> v. <EM>Lewis,</EM> 349 Conn.
9, 19 n.6, 312 A.3d 1040 (2024). As a result,
the habeas court in this case was free to
consider the merits of count one after it
dismissed that count on res judicata
grounds, and its conclusion with respect to
the merits of count one constitutes an alternative
holding. Cf. <EM>Mulvihill</EM> v. <EM>Spinnato,</EM>
228 Conn. App. 781, 788 n.12, 326 A.3d
251, cert. denied, 350 Conn. 926, 326 A.3d
248 (2024); see <EM>Rosenthal Law Firm, LLC</EM>
v. <EM>Cohen,</EM> 190 Conn. App. 284, 293, 210
A.3d 579 (2019) (distinguishing dicta from
alternative holdings and explaining that
when court "has focused on the legal issue
presented by the case before it and made a
deliberate decision to resolve the issue,
that ruling becomes the law" (internal quotation
marks omitted)).

<P20>On appeal, the only portion of the
habeas court's ruling on the merits of
count one that the petitioner contests is its
conclusion that the state's failure to disclose
to him St. Julien's statement to the
police did not violate the petitioner's due
process rights. Because he
<SPage 414>
has not contested
or even referred in his brief to the
court's conclusions with respect to any of
the other specific due process allegations
contained in count one, he has abandoned
any challenge to those portions of its ruling.
See <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Saucier,</EM> 283 Conn. 207,
223, 926 A.2d 633 (2007) (unmentioned
claim is, by definition, inadequately briefed
and therefore abandoned); <EM>Forestier</EM> v.
<EM>Bridgeport,</EM> 223 Conn. App. 298, 314, 308
A.3d 102 (2024) ("[w]e do not reverse the
judgment of a trial court on the basis of
challenges to its rulings that have not been
adequately briefed" (internal quotation
marks omitted)). And for the reasons set
forth in part III A of this opinion, we
agree with the habeas court that the failure
to disclose St. Julien's statement to the
police did not violate the petitioner's due
process rights. Therefore, we affirm, on an
alternative basis, the habeas court's denial
of relief on count one and decline to remand
the case for further proceedings on
the merits of that count.<fnr19>
<SPage 415>

<CN>II

<P20>The petitioner next claims that
the habeas court erred in rejecting his
claim that, during his underlying criminal
prosecution, he was improperly excluded
<Page 1045>
from an in-chambers conference regarding
a possible conflict of interest on the part of
his counsel. He argues that his exclusion
from the in-chambers conference violated
his constitutional right to be present at a
critical stage of the prosecution and that
this violation constitutes structural error
for which he need not demonstrate prejudice.
We are not persuaded.

<P20>The following additional facts and procedural
history are relevant to this claim. At
the outset of his underlying criminal prosecution,
the petitioner was represented by
Mirsky.<fnr20> Mirsky also represented St. Julien,
one of the petitioner's codefendants.
On July 2, 1996, the court, <EM>Maiocco, J.,</EM>
held a joint hearing in probable cause for
the petitioner and St. Julien. At the start
of the hearing, Mirsky identified himself as
counsel for the petitioner and St. Julien,
and stated: "[A]t this time I find no conflict
of interest." The court did not further
inquire, during that hearing, as to the basis
for Mirsky's conclusion that no conflict
existed. On May 15, 1997, however, Mirsky
moved to withdraw as the petitioner's
counsel on the ground that "there may or
could possibly arise a conflict of interest
...." The court, <EM>Ronan, J.,</EM> granted the
motion on May 28, 1997, and appointed
Randolph in Mirsky's stead.

<P20>On July 15, 1997, Randolph moved to
dismiss the charges against the petitioner,
arguing that the court had violated the
petitioner's right to the effective assistance
of counsel by failing to canvass him concerning
a waiver of his right to conflict
free representation at the July 2, 1996
probable cause hearing. The court,
<SPage 416>
<EM>Ford, J.,</EM> heard argument on the motion
to dismiss on October 9, 1997. During that
hearing, Satti (the prosecuting attorney)
stated: "The claim of the [petitioner] is
that the court had an obligation to inquire,
on the record, regarding a conflict. Our
position is that that was made known to
the court, in chambers, and the response
of the defense counsel, on the record, foreclosed
any further inquiry by the court,
therefore, not necessitating an inquiry on
the record because it was done in chambers."
This statement forms the basis of
the petitioner's allegation that he was excluded
from an in-chambers conference
concerning a possible conflict of interest.

<P20>During the habeas trial, the petitioner's
counsel questioned Satti repeatedly about
his October 9, 1997 statement and whether
an in-chambers conference regarding a
potential conflict had occurred. On direct
examination, in response to counsel's
question: "Did you have an in-chambers
conversation ... about the conflict that
existed between [Mirsky] representing
[the petitioner] and St. Julien at the same
time?" Satti stated: "I have no memory of
that." Satti then reviewed the transcript
of October 9, 1997, but did not further
testify during his direct examination as to
this alleged in-chambers conference. The
petitioner's counsel renewed her inquiry
on redirect examination, leading to the following
colloquy:

<P20>"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: Do you recall
the in-chambers or judicial pretrial,
however you want to call it, conversation
that you had with [Mirsky] concerning [the
petitioner] and [St. Julien]?

<P20>"[The Witness]: For both of them?

<P20>"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: Yes.

<P20>"[The Witness]: No. That&mdash;I have no&mdash;
<EM>that did not occur.</EM>
<SPage 417>

<P20>"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: If there's
a transcript that says where you say, on
the record, that you had an in-chambers
<Page 1046>
discussion about the conflict, would that
refresh your recollection?

<P20>"[The Witness]: Is that the item you
gave me earlier today?

<P20>"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: It might
have been. I believe there were two separate
days, but it might have been....

<P20>"[The Witness]: And <EM>I do recall saying
that there was an in-chamber</EM>[<EM>s</EM>]&mdash;<EM>not that
I participated in the in-chambers conference,
but there was an in-chambers conference</EM>
between [Mirsky], and I forgot who
the&mdash;Judge Maiocco, I believe it was, did
the [probable cause hearing]. So, that
was&mdash;where I saw on that document, I was
referring to the fact that there was a
motion to dismiss filed by [Randolph]....

<P20>"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: ... Do you
recall what dates the supervised judicial
pretrials occurred?

<P20>"[The Witness]: In the beginning of October.

<P20>"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: Was that
the only one?

<P20>"[The Witness]: That was the only one
that I noted in my file, <EM>which leads me to
believe that there</EM> [<EM>were</EM>] <EM>no other ones.</EM>

<P20>"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: Do you have
in your file any other notes concerning
when judicial pretrials occurred?

<P20>"[The Witness]: In my notes, yes. And
there were no other notes of any judicial
pretrials with the other defendants, <EM>not</EM>
[<EM>the petitioner</EM>], <EM>clearly.</EM>...

<P20>"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: Okay. Now,
on [May 28], 1997, and I might have
showed you this transcript, I don't recall
... the court says to [the petitioner],
<SPage 418>
you're aware that [Mirsky] has to withdraw
because he represents one of the
codefendants, and it would be a conflict of
interest. And at the prior hearing in probable
cause, which occurred in July of 1996,
Mirsky said that he did not believe that
there was a conflict of interest.

<P20>"Now, the judicial pretrials that we've
talked about, did one of those&mdash;or do you
have any idea if a judicial pretrial or an in-chambers
conversation happened around
May of [1997]?

<P20>"[The Witness]: <EM>I don't have any independent
recollection of that.</EM>

<P20>"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: Would you
have any notes concerning that in your
file?

<P20>"[The Witness]: <EM>If they existed, I would.
And there's none in the file.</EM>...

<P20>[Satti briefly left the witness stand to
procure his file from the petitioner's criminal
prosecution.]

<P20>"[The Petitioner's Counsel]: ... Can you
look into your file and see if there were
any notes concerning judicial pretrial or
in-chamber[s] discussions in [the petitioner's]
or St. Julien's case with [Mirsky]
around&mdash;

<P20>"[The Witness]: Well, I didn't bring St.
Julien's file with me. You asked me only to
bring [the petitioner's], but I'll look in the
[petitioner's] file.... So, I reviewed my
notes, which are&mdash;<EM>I write down everything
I do.</EM> First note is appointment of counsel
and setting of a hearing in probable cause
date, the probable cause date. <EM>There is no
other note regarding</EM> [<EM>Mirsky</EM>]. The first
note is conversations with [Randolph], and
the presiding judge at that time was Judge
John Ronan....

<P20>"The Court: So, I mean, for the court's
information, counsel, I get, at some point,
lots of files get to the point where there's
supervised judicial pretrial. This case is
pending for a year, and you don't have any
notes
<SPage 419>
about any general conversations
you have with defense counsel about
what's going on with the file, where it's
moving? I mean, what goes on? I mean, I
know for a fact files don't just meander
along for a year without some discussions.
<Page 1047>

<P20>"[The Witness]: Correct. And on this
file, it was unique in that it appeared that
nobody wanted to resolve anything, and
you're right, I didn't write that specific
note down. But I have a memory of nobody
wanted to resolve it. And it basically
went from a point where there was inaction
on the file for whatever the reason
was, and then the only other action was
[Randolph] getting in the file, which would
have been [1997], which we then had the
trial." (Emphasis added.)

<P20>In its memorandum of decision,
the habeas court found that the in-chambers
conference that the petitioner
alleged had taken place never actually occurred.
The court did not mention Satti's
comments during the October 9, 1997
hearing,<fnr21> it concluded that neither the
transcript of the July 2, 1996 probable
cause hearing nor
<SPage 420>
the transcript of Mirsky's
withdrawal and Randolph's appointment
on May 28, 1997, supported the petitioner's
allegations. It further determined
that Satti had, during his habeas trial testimony,
"offered no information that would
support the petitioner's claim."

<P20>"It is well established that the
burden of establishing grounds for relief in
a habeas corpus proceeding rest[s] with
the petitioner.... The petitioner, as the
plaintiff in a habeas corpus proceeding,
bears a heavy burden of proof." (Citation

<P20>We discern no clear error in the habeas
court's finding that no in-chambers discussion
occurred. Indeed, at several points
<Page 1048>
Satti's testimony during the habeas trial
undercuts such a conclusion. In particular,
Satti explained that, although he "write[s]
down everything [he] do[es]," his file from
the petitioner's case contained
<SPage 421>
no notes
regarding Mirsky following his appointment
as trial counsel, nor did it indicate
that Satti participated in any in-chambers
conversations concerning the petitioner in
or about May, 1997, when Mirsky moved
to withdraw from representation. Furthermore,
Satti testified that, although he recalled
making his comments on October 9,
1997, he did not recall any in-chambers
conference having taken place; indeed, at
one point he stated that such a conference
"did not occur." When this testimony is
considered alongside the transcript of October
9, 1997, the record is, at best, ambiguous
as to whether the discussion from
which the petitioner alleges he was excluded
actually happened. Because the petitioner
had the burden of proof, the habeas
court was free, in light of the conflicting
evidence in the record, to conclude that the
petitioner had not established the factual
predicate of his claim. Mindful of the limited
scope of our review of the habeas
court's factual findings, we are not&mdash;on
this record&mdash;left with a "definite and firm
conviction" that the habeas court erred in
finding that no in-chambers discussion occurred.
Accordingly, the petitioner's claim
fails, and we therefore do not reach the
question of whether the petitioner's alleged
exclusion from such a discussion violated
his constitutional rights.

<CN>III

<P20>The petitioner next claims that the habeas
court erred when it concluded that his
first habeas counsel, McKay, did not render
ineffective assistance by failing. (1) to
raise a <EM>Brady</EM> claim pertaining to an undisclosed
statement given by the petitioner's
codefendant, St. Julien, to the Bridgeport
Police Department, and (2) to raise the
claim that the petitioner had been excluded
from a critical stage of his underlying
criminal proceeding, which we have discussed
in part II of this opinion. We disagree.
<SPage 422>

<P20>The following additional facts and
procedural history are relevant to this
claim. In his underlying criminal proceeding,
the petitioner was charged with, inter
alia, kidnapping in the second degree in
violation of &sect; 53a-94 (a), conspiracy to commit
kidnapping in the second degree in
violation of &sect;&sect; 53a-48 and 53a-94 (a), and
felony murder in violation of &sect; 53a-54c. At
the time of the petitioner's trial in 1997, as
is the case today, &sect; 53a-94 (a) provided: "A
person is guilty of kidnapping in the second
degree when he abducts another person."
At the petitioner's trial, the court
instructed the jury that it could not find
the petitioner guilty of kidnapping unless
it "first [found] it established that there
was ... a restriction of [the victim's]
movement, that it [had] been done intentionally
... and it [had] the effect of interfering
substantially with the victim's liberty."
Kidnapping in the second degree was
also the predicate felony for the felony
murder charge. The state argued at trial
that the victim had been kidnapped because
he had been dragged off the porch of
244 Olive Street in Bridgeport and forced
into a car that the petitioner was driving.

<P20>The petitioner was found guilty by the
jury on October 21, 1997. The following
day, St. Julien entered an <EM>Alford</EM> plea to
conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the
second degree. That same day&mdash;October
22, 1997&mdash;St. Julien also gave a recorded
statement, in the presence of his counsel,
to Detective Robert Martin of the Bridgeport
Police Department in the office of the
state's attorney in Bridgeport. A transcript
of this statement was entered into evidence
in the habeas trial.

<P20>In his statement, St. Julien stated in
relevant part that, on May 11, 1996&mdash;the
<Page 1049>
day of the incident at issue&mdash;he and the
petitioner had traveled to 244 Olive Street
to ask Hamilton, who resided at that address,
for some money that he owed St.
Julien. When St. Julien and the petitioner
arrived at Hamilton's residence, the victim
<SPage 423>
was already there. After St. Julien and
the petitioner arrived, St. Victor also arrived
at the residence separately and also
asked Hamilton for money that he owed
him.<fnr22> An argument ensued between St.
Victor and Hamilton. While the argument
between St. Victor and Hamilton was ongoing,
the petitioner told St. Julien, "let's
go," and the petitioner and St. Julien went
to sit in the petitioner's car. The petitioner
sat in the driver's seat and St. Julien sat in
the front passenger seat. The petitioner
started the car and began trying to fix its
tape player. As he was doing so, St. Julien
saw St. Victor and the victim walking toward
the car. St. Victor and the victim got
into the car and asked, "what was doing?"
St. Julien stated that, at that time, he, the
petitioner, St. Victor and the victim were
"just chilling...." When Martin asked St.
Julien if the victim had "indicate[d] to you
or anybody else that you heard that he
didn't want to go in the car," St. Julien
responded: "No. I just [saw] him and [St.
Victor] coming [toward] the car." St. Julien
likewise denied hearing "any discussion of,
asking or telling [the victim] to come
along" with him, the petitioner, and St.
Victor.

<P20>St. Julien further stated that, after St.
Victor and the victim got into the car, the
four of them drove to Johnson's residence
to pick him up and "[go] chilling" with him
before St. Julien and the petitioner went to
a movie. They picked up Johnson, who got
into the backseat next to the victim. Johnson
and the victim then got into an argument
in which Johnson stated: "I need to
know where my shit at...." St. Julien did
not know to what Johnson was referring.
Johnson and the victim began hitting each
other in the backseat, at which point the
petitioner, who was driving, stated: "[Y]o,
chill, you can't be doing that shit, you have
to stop." Johnson
<SPage 424>
then told the petitioner
to drive him to an area near Bishop
Avenue in Bridgeport. Johnson did not say
why he wanted to go to that location, but
St. Julien assumed that it was because
Johnson "[sold] drugs in that side of town
...." Once they arrived, Johnson and the
victim got out of the car, at which point
they began arguing again. As the argument
escalated, Johnson pulled out a gun.
The petitioner got out of the car and said:
"[W]hat [are] you doin[g] ... chill, don't
do that." Johnson then shot the victim
twice.

<P20>St. Julien did not testify in the petitioner's
criminal trial, nor did he testify in the
habeas trial in this matter. At the habeas
trial, Satti testified that, although St. Julien
gave his statement to Martin in the
state's attorney's office, he (Satti) was not
present. The transcript of St. Julien's
statement does not indicate that anyone
was present apart from St. Julien, Mirsky
(his attorney), and Martin. Satti further
testified that the police would "routinely"
use a room at the state's attorney's office
to conduct interviews and that, in St. Julien's
case, because he was incarcerated,
the police decided to take his statement at
the state's attorney's office because "they
couldn't take it at the police station...."
Though he did not recall the precise procedure
by which the police could arrange to
use the room for an interview, Satti confirmed
that the police would have had to
arrange the interview with someone in the
state's attorney's office ahead of time. Satti
<Page 1050>
had no recollection of having been personally
notified in advance that St. Julien
intended to give a statement. He also testified
that, prior to giving the statement to
Martin, St. Julien had exercised his right
to remain silent and that he (Satti) had
had no discussions with either St. Julien or
his counsel regarding a waiver of that
right before St. Julien gave the statement.
Satti admitted that, when he received a
copy of St. Julien's statement, he did not
provide it to the petitioner's counsel.
<SPage 425>

<P20>McKay, the petitioner's first habeas
counsel, testified briefly in the habeas trial
in the present case. He testified that he
did not recall the claims he had raised in
the first habeas petition; that he did not
recall the names of the petitioner's codefendants;
that he had a "vague recollection"
of a statement from one of the petitioner's
codefendants<fnr23> but did not recall
what it said; and that he had not been able
to review any materials in preparation for
his testimony, in part because he had previously
turned over his file to another attorney
after his representation of the petitioner
concluded. After reviewing a portion
of the transcript from the first habeas
trial, McKay testified that his recollection
had not been refreshed.

<P20>In her closing argument before the habeas
court in the present case, the petitioner's
counsel argued that St. Julien's
statement was material and exculpatory
within the meaning of <EM>Brady</EM> because it
undercut the state's claim that the victim
had been kidnapped and demonstrated
that he had in fact gotten into the petitioner's
car "o[f] [his] own accord." She also
argued that McKay as well as the petitioner's
second and third habeas counsel had
rendered ineffective assistance by failing
to conduct an adequate investigation into
the statement's existence and to plead a
<EM>Brady</EM> claim based on the statement's suppression.

<P20>The habeas court ruled against the petitioner
on his claims of ineffective assistance
of first habeas counsel. Relevant to
this appeal, the court concluded that the
petitioner could not establish deficient performance
<SPage 426>
because McKay had testified
that he had no memory of the petitioner's
case, meaning that the petitioner was unable
to present "affirmative evidence sufficient
to overcome the presumption of competent
representation." The court further
determined that, even if the petitioner
could establish deficient performance, he
could not establish prejudice from
McKay's failure to plead and prove a <EM>Brady</EM>
claim pertaining to St. Julien's statement
because St. Julien's statement was
not "`material'" under <EM>Brady.</EM> In particular,
the court concluded that St. Julien's
statement was "fact-starved" and implausible,
such that there was no reasonable
probability that it would have changed the
outcome of the petitioner's trial. The court
also wrote, in a footnote, that, "[g]iven the
determination by the court already in analyzing
other claims that there is no credible
proof that there was an in-chambers
conversation about the petitioner's defense
counsel having a conflict of interest ...
there is no need for the court to analyze
those claims in the context of the petitioner's
claim that ... McKay was ineffective
for failing to prove these claims against
... Randolph."

<P20>"We begin with well settled legal
principles, including our standard of
<Page 1051>
review. To succeed on a claim of ineffective
assistance of counsel, a habeas petitioner
must satisfy the two-pronged test articulated
in <EM>Strickland</EM> v. <EM>Washington,</EM> [466
U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d
674 (1984)]. <EM>Strickland</EM> requires that a petitioner
satisfy both a performance prong
and a prejudice prong. To satisfy the performance
prong, a claimant must demonstrate
that counsel made errors so serious
that counsel was not functioning as the
counsel guaranteed ... by the [s]ixth
[a]mendment.... To satisfy the prejudice
prong, a claimant must demonstrate that
there is a reasonable probability that, but
for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result
of the proceeding would have been
different.... Because both prongs ...
<SPage 427>
must be established for a habeas petitioner
to prevail, a court may [deny] a
petitioner's claim if he fails to meet either
prong....

<P20>"Our Supreme Court, in <EM>Lozada</EM> v. <EM>Warden,</EM>
[supra, 223 Conn. at 843, 613 A.2d
818], established that habeas corpus is an
appropriate remedy for the ineffective assistance
of appointed habeas counsel, authorizing
... a second petition for a writ of
habeas corpus ... challenging the performance
of counsel in litigating an initial
petition for a writ of habeas corpus ...
[that] had claimed ineffective assistance of
counsel at the petitioner's underlying criminal
trial or on direct appeal.... Our Supreme
Court subsequently expanded <EM>Lozada</EM>'s
holding to encompass third habeas
petitions challenging the performance of
second habeas counsel.... Nevertheless,
the court in <EM>Lozada</EM> also emphasized that a
petitioner asserting a habeas on a habeas
faces the herculean task ... of proving in
accordance with [<EM>Strickland</EM>] both (1) that
his appointed habeas counsel was ineffective,
and (2) that his trial counsel was
ineffective....

<P20>"Simply put, a petitioner cannot
succeed ... on a claim that his habeas
counsel was ineffective by failing to raise a
claim against trial counsel or prior habeas
counsel in a prior habeas action unless the
petitioner ultimately will be able to demonstrate
that the claim against trial or prior
habeas counsel would have had a reasonable
probability of success if raised....

<P20>"The habeas court is afforded
broad discretion in making its factual findings,
and those findings will not be disturbed
[on appeal] unless they are clearly
erroneous.... Thus, the [habeas] court's
factual findings are entitled to great
weight.... The application of the habeas
court's factual findings to the pertinent
legal standard, however, presents a mixed
question of law and fact, which is subject
to plenary review....
<SPage 428>
Whether a petitioner
received constitutionally inadequate
representation is a mixed question of law
and fact that requires plenary review."

<CN>A

<P20>The petitioner argues that the habeas
court improperly determined that
McKay was not ineffective for failing to
raise a <EM>Brady</EM> claim pertaining to St. Julien's
statement. Because we agree with
the habeas court's conclusion that St. Julien's
statement was not material within
the meaning of <EM>Brady,</EM> and hence that the
petitioner was not prejudiced,<fnr24> we reject
the petitioner's claim.
<Page 1052>
<SPage 429>

<P20>"In <EM>Brady</EM> ... the United
States Supreme Court held that the suppression
by the prosecution of evidence
favorable to an accused ... violates due
process where the evidence is material either
to guilt or to punishment, irrespective
of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.
To establish a <EM>Brady</EM> violation, the
defendant must show that (1) the government
suppressed evidence, (2) the suppressed
evidence was favorable to the defendant,
and (3) it was material [either to
guilt or to punishment].... [E]vidence is
material if there is a reasonable probability
that, had the evidence been disclosed to
the defense, the result of the proceeding
would have been different." (Citations

507, cert. denied, 294 Conn. 906, 982 A.2d

as to materiality under <EM>Brady</EM> presents a
mixed question of law and fact subject to
plenary review, with the underlying historical
facts subject to review for clear error.
See, e.g., <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Ortiz,</EM> 280 Conn. 686,
720, 911 A.2d 1055 (2006).

<P20>As a threshold matter, it is unclear
whether a <EM>Brady</EM> claim pertaining to St.
Julien's statement is cognizable, given that
his statement did not come into existence
until one day after the petitioner's trial
had concluded. In <EM>District Attorney's Office</EM>
v. <EM>Osborne,</EM> 557 U.S. 52, 68-69, 129 S.
Ct. 2308, 174 L. Ed. 2d 38 (2009), the
United States Supreme Court held that
<EM>Brady</EM>'s disclosure obligation does not continue
"after [a] defendant [is] convicted
and the case [is] closed," explaining that
<EM>Brady</EM> is a "preconviction trial [right]" that
a defendant
<SPage 430>
does not retain once he has
been "proved guilty after a fair trial" and
lost the presumption of innocence.

<P20>Some courts have held that, notwithstanding
<EM>Osborne,</EM> a prosecutor's <EM>Brady</EM>
obligations continue through to the conclusion
of a defendant's direct appeal&mdash;a rule
that would mean St. Julien's statement
<EM>was</EM> subject to <EM>Brady</EM> disclosure because
our Supreme Court did not decide the
petitioner's direct appeal until 2001. See,
e.g., <EM>Fields</EM> v. <EM>Wharrie,</EM> 672 F.3d 505, 514-15
(7th Cir. 2012); <EM>Runningeagle</EM> v. <EM>Ryan,</EM>
686 F.3d 758, 772 n.6 (9th Cir. 2012), cert.
<Page 1053>
denied, 569 U.S. 1026, 133 S. Ct. 2766, 186
L. Ed. 2d 233 (2013). The United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
by contrast, appears to have concluded
that the prosecutor's <EM>Brady</EM> obligations
terminate at the moment of conviction; see,
e.g., <EM>United States</EM> v. <EM>Santos,</EM> 486 Fed.
Appx. 133, 135 n.1 (2d Cir. 2012) (summary
order); and at least one District Court
within the Second Circuit has accordingly
determined that, under <EM>Osborne,</EM> a prosecutor
had no duty to disclose allegedly
exculpatory statements by a codefendant
that were made between a habeas petitioner's
conviction and sentencing, like the
statement at issue in this case. See <EM>Dotsenko</EM>
v. <EM>Joseph,</EM> Docket No. 18-CV-1640
(WFK), 2019 WL 4917952, *4-5 (E.D.N.Y.
October 4, 2019). Neither this court nor
our Supreme Court appears to have addressed
the implications of <EM>Osborne</EM>'s holding
for <EM>Brady</EM> claims pertaining to evidence
that comes into existence between
the time of a petitioner's conviction but
before sentencing and the conclusion of a
direct appeal.

<P20>We need not decide this question today,
however, because&mdash;even if we assume arguendo
that the petitioner was entitled,
under <EM>Brady,</EM> to material exculpatory information
that only came into existence
the day after his conviction&mdash;St. Julien's
statement was not material. Although the
petitioner argues that the statement
"would have raised a reasonable doubt in
the
<SPage 431>
minds of the jury as to the petitioner's
guilt"; (internal quotation marks omitted);
this argument, which focuses on the
impact the statement would have had at
the petitioner's criminal trial, defies logic.
There is no reasonable probability that,
had the statement been disclosed to the
petitioner, the result of his trial would
have been different because the earliest
point at which the statement could conceivably
have been disclosed&mdash;the day St. Julien
gave it&mdash;was after the trial had concluded.

<P20>Nonetheless, had St. Julien's statement
been promptly disclosed, the petitioner
could have filed a motion for a new trial on
the basis of newly discovered evidence
pursuant to General Statutes &sect; 52-270.<fnr25>
See <EM>Reyes</EM> v. <EM>State,</EM> 222 Conn. App. 510,
529, 306 A.3d 5 (2023), cert. denied, 348
Conn. 944, 307 A.3d 910 (2024). As such,
for purposes of the materiality analysis, we
consider whether there was a reasonable
probability that St. Julien's statement, had
it been presented in support of such a
motion, would have resulted in a new trial
for the petitioner.<fnr26>
<Page 1054>
<SPage 432>

<P20>For a petitioner to be entitled
to a new trial on the basis of newly discovered
evidence, he must establish (1) that
the proffered evidence is newly discovered,
such that it could not have been discovered
earlier by the exercise of due diligence; (2)
that it would be material in a new trial; (3)
it is not merely cumulative; and (4) it is
likely produce a new result in a different
trial. See, e.g., <EM>Asherman</EM> v. <EM>State,</EM> 202
Conn. 429, 434, 521 A.2d 578 (1987). In
<EM>Shabazz</EM> v. <EM>State,</EM> 259 Conn. 811, 827, 792
A.2d 797 (2002), our Supreme Court held
that a trial court considering whether newly
discovered evidence satisfies <EM>Asherman</EM>'s
fourth prong must evaluate whether
that evidence "passes a minimum credibility
threshold." As the court made clear in
<EM>Shabazz,</EM> this holding broke no new
ground; rather, it was simply a crystallization
of prior Connecticut case law, dating
to the nineteenth century, on the granting
of new trials. See id. at 822-23, 792 A.2d
797 (collecting cases). In <EM>Adams</EM> v. <EM>State,</EM>
259 Conn. 831, 841, 792 A.2d 809 (2002),
decided on the same day as <EM>Shabazz,</EM> the
court further explained that, "absent extraordinary
or extenuating circumstances,
the court [considering a motion for a new
trial] should make its credibility assessments
... on the basis of the presentation
of live testimony, rather than on the basis
of a printed record." This holding, too, is
consistent with long established principles
for determining the credibility of evidence.
See, e.g., <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Synakorn,</EM> 239 Conn.
427, 436, 685 A.2d 1123 (1996) (trier of
fact's "firsthand observation of [witnesses']
conduct, demeanor and attitude" renders it
better judge of witness credibility than
reviewing court, which is limited to "cold
printed
<SPage 433>
record" (internal quotation
marks omitted)); <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Henning,</EM> 220
Conn. 417, 420, 599 A.2d 1065 (1991)
(same); <EM>Wieler</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
47 Conn. App. 59, 61, 702 A.2d 1195
(same), cert. denied, 243 Conn. 957, 704
A.2d 806 (1997).

<P20>In light of the bedrock legal principles
articulated in <EM>Shabazz</EM> and <EM>Adams,</EM> we do
not believe that there is a reasonable probability
that St. Julien's statement would
have satisfied <EM>Asherman</EM>'s fourth prong,
thereby entitling the petitioner to a new
trial. St. Julien's statement is a written
document&mdash;precisely the kind of "printed
record" that our courts have long held to
be an insufficient basis on which to make a
credibility determination. It is, of course,
theoretically <EM>possible</EM> that St. Julien may
have supplemented his statement with live
testimony had the petitioner filed and litigated
a motion for a new trial, but St.
Julien did not testify during the habeas
trial and the habeas court made no findings
as to whether St. Julien would have
testified had the petitioner moved for a
new trial, or whether his testimony would
have been credible and consistent with his
statement, and we may not and will not
speculate on the subject. See, e.g., <EM>Priest</EM>
v. <EM>Edmonds,</EM> 295 Conn. 132, 138, 989 A.2d
588 (2010) (role of reviewing court "is not
to guess at possibilities ... but to review
claims based on a complete factual record
developed by a trial court" (internal quotation
marks omitted)). Presented with St.
Julien's written statement, standing alone,
we do not think that there is a reasonable
probability that a court would have found
that evidence sufficiently credible to grant
the petitioner a new trial.<fnr27>
<Page 1055>

<P20>We thus conclude that, even if the prosecutor
had an obligation under <EM>Brady</EM> to
disclose material exculpatory
<SPage 434>
evidence
that came into existence after the jury
returned its verdict in the petitioner's
criminal trial, the petitioner's claim predicated
on St. Julien's statement would not
have been viable because it was not material
within the meaning of <EM>Brady.</EM> Therefore,
McKay's failure to raise such a claim
in the petitioner's first habeas case did not
prejudice the petitioner.

<CN>B

<P20>The petitioner also claims that the
habeas court improperly concluded that
McKay did not render ineffective assistance
by failing to plead and prove that the
petitioner was excluded from a critical
stage of his criminal prosecution&mdash;namely,
the alleged in-chambers conference pertaining
to Mirsky's conflict of interest. We
disagree.

<P20>In light of our analysis in part II
of this opinion, this claim merits only a
brief discussion. When reviewing a claim of
ineffective assistance of counsel, we are
bound by the habeas court's factual findings
unless they are clearly erroneous.
See, e.g., <EM>Crocker</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM>
supra, 220 Conn. App. at 586, 300
A.3d 607. As we have discussed, the habeas
court found that no in-chambers conference
regarding a conflict of interest had
occurred, and that factual finding is not
clearly erroneous. Therefore, the petitioner
cannot have been prejudiced by
McKay's failure to plead and prove a claim
predicated on the petitioner's exclusion
from that alleged conference.

<CN>IV

<P20>The petitioner also claims that the
habeas court erred when it concluded that
his second habeas counsel, Mullaney, and
his third habeas counsel, Goddard and
Waldron, had not rendered ineffective assistance<fnr28>
by failing
<SPage 435>
to plead and prove
the ineffectiveness claims discussed in part
III of this opinion against McKay. We
disagree.

<P20>The habeas court concluded in relevant
part that, because the petitioner had failed
to prove his ineffectiveness claims against
McKay, he could not establish that Mullaney,
Goddard, or Waldron were ineffective
for failing to raise those claims against
McKay in the petitioner's second and third
habeas petitions. For the reasons we set
forth in part III of this opinion, we agree
that the petitioner's ineffectiveness claims
against McKay lack merit. Therefore,
there is no reasonable probability that, had
the petitioner's second or third habeas
counsel raised those claims, the petitioner
<Page 1056>
would have prevailed in those prior habeas
proceedings.

<P20>The judgment is affirmed.

<P20>In this opinion the other judges
concurred.
<FN>
<fnt1> See <EM>Brady</EM> v. <EM>Maryland,</EM> 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83
S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963).

<fnt2> General Statutes &sect; 53a-54c was amended by
No. 15-211, &sect; 3, of the 2015 Public Acts,
which made technical changes to the statute
that are not relevant to this appeal. In the
interest of simplicity, we refer to the current
revision of &sect; 53a-54c.

<fnt3> See <EM>North Carolina</EM> v. <EM>Alford,</EM> 400 U.S. 25,
37, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970). "A
defendant who pleads guilty under the <EM>Alford</EM>
doctrine does not admit guilt but acknowledges
that the state's evidence against him is
so strong that he is prepared to accept the
entry of a guilty plea." (Internal quotation
marks omitted.) <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Webb,</EM> 62 Conn. App.
805, 807 n.1, 772 A.2d 690 (2001).

<fnt4> Johnson had been charged with murder in
violation of &sect; 53a-54a (a), kidnapping in the
second degree in violation of &sect; 53a-94 (a),
felony murder in violation of &sect; 53a-54c, capital
felony in violation of General Statutes
(Rev. to 1995) &sect; 53a-54b (5) and conspiracy to
commit murder in violation of &sect;&sect; 53a-48 and
53a-54a.

<fnt5> The petitioner also filed a petition for a writ
of habeas corpus in 2010 but withdrew it
prior to trial. See <EM>Cator</EM> v. <EM>Warden,</EM> Superior
Court, judicial district of Tolland, Docket No.
CV-10-4003845-S (March 21, 2013). In the
interest of clarity, when discussing the petitioner's
first, second, and third habeas proceedings
and habeas counsel in this opinion,
we refer only to those three prior habeas
petitions that were decided after trials on the
merits.

<fnt6> Judge Nazzaro rendered an oral decision
denying the petitioner's habeas petition on
November 21, 2008. A copy of the decision
was transmitted to the Office of the Reporter
of Judicial Decisions on February 19, 2009. In
the Westlaw database for unreported Connecticut
cases, Judge Nazzaro's decision is
dated February 19, 2009.

<fnt7> Randolph is currently a senior judge of the
Superior Court.

<fnt8> The numbering of this list corresponds to
the numbering of the counts in the operative
petition. The petitioner withdrew count eight
on the record after the close of evidence.

<fnt9> Practice Book &sect; 23-29 provides in relevant
part: "The judicial authority may, at any time,
upon its own motion or upon motion of the
respondent, dismiss the petition, or any count
thereof, if it determines that ...

<P20>"(3) the petition presents the same ground
as a prior petition previously denied and fails
to state new facts or to proffer new evidence
not reasonably available at the time of the
prior petition ...

<P20>"(5) any other legally sufficient ground for
dismissal of the petition exists."

<fnt10> The petitioner does not challenge the habeas
court's dismissal of count four, which alleged
actual innocence.

<fnt11> We discuss the details of this statement in
part III of this opinion.

<fnt12> At the petitioner's criminal trial, the state
called Kamper to testify as an eyewitness to
the kidnapping.

<fnt13> Specifically, in his first habeas petition, the
petitioner requested the following relief: "[1]
Order a writ of habeas corpus be issued to
bring [the petitioner] before this court in order
that justice may be done. [2] That the
convictions and sentence described herein be
ordered vacated and the matter be returned
to the trial court dockets for further proceedings
according to law. [3] Such other relief as
law and justice require." The operative petition
in the present case requested that the
court "issue a writ of habeas corpus: (1) vacating
the judgments in [the petitioner's underlying
criminal case]; (2) directing the sentencing
courts to vacate the judgment in [the
petitioner's underlying criminal case] within
ninety days or some other certain and reasonable
period of time; and (3) ordering whatever
other relief that law and justice require."

<fnt14> Although the parties and the habeas court
referred to this claim as one of "prosecutorial
misconduct," it is more accurately characterized
as a "prosecutorial impropriety" claim.
See <EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Fauci,</EM> 282 Conn. 23, 26 n.2, 917
A.2d 978 (2007).

<fnt15> For reasons that are unclear, in its memorandum
of decision the court addressed the
remainder of the due process allegations
pleaded in count one under the subheading
"Count Two."

<fnt16> McPhillips was a firearms examiner with
the state police forensics laboratory who testified
for the state at the petitioner's criminal
trial.

<fnt17> Because we agree that the petitioner's
claims in count one are not identical to the
prosecutorial impropriety claim that he
brought in his first habeas action, we do not
address his alternative challenges to the habeas
court's dismissal of count one.

<fnt18> We note that, in the petitioner's third habeas
action, he also presented a claim of
ineffective assistance of trial counsel against
Randolph, which Judge Sferrazza also dismissed
on res judicata grounds under Practice
Book &sect; 23-29. See <EM>Cator</EM> v. <EM>Warden,</EM> supra,
2016 WL 6603685, *1.

<fnt19> We may generally affirm a lower court's
judgment on an alternative ground so long as
the appellant is not prejudiced thereby. See
<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Osuch,</EM> 124 Conn. App. 572, 580, 5
A.3d 976, cert. denied, 299 Conn. 918, 10
A.3d 1052 (2010). Under the circumstances of
this case, we conclude that the petitioner
would not be prejudiced by our decision to
affirm the habeas court's judgment on an
alternative basis. Because the habeas court
set forth two independent bases for its denial
of relief on count one in its memorandum of
decision&mdash;res judicata and its ruling on the
merits of count one&mdash;the petitioner was on
notice from the moment his petition was denied
that the alternative basis on which we
rely to sustain the habeas court's judgment
existed. Indeed, in his petition for certification
to appeal (though not in his principal
appellate brief), the petitioner raised several
challenges to other portions of the habeas
court's ruling on the merits of count one.
Moreover, in his brief, the respondent argued
that, even if the habeas court's res judicata
dismissal of count one was erroneous, the
court's ruling on the merits of the petitioner's
claim pertaining to St. Julien's statement provided
an alternative basis on which to sustain
its judgment. Accordingly, the petitioner had
a full and fair opportunity to challenge the
habeas court's ruling on the merits of count
one as and to the extent he believed appropriate.
Cf., e.g., <EM>Devine</EM> v. <EM>Fusaro,</EM> 205 Conn. App.
554, 584 n.23, 259 A.3d 655 (2021), appeal
dismissed, 346 Conn. 29, 287 A.3d 598 (2023)
(certification improvidently granted); <EM>State</EM> v.
<EM>Martin M.,</EM> 143 Conn. App. 140, 151-53, 70
A.3d 135, cert. denied, 309 Conn. 919, 70
A.3d 41 (2013).

<fnt20> According to the information provided to
the habeas court and uncontested by either
party, Mirsky is deceased.

<fnt21> Although "the trier [of fact] is bound to
consider all the evidence which has been admitted,
as far as admissible, for all the purposes
for which it was offered and claimed
... [w]e cannot assume that the court's conclusions
were reached without due weight
having been given to the evidence presented
and the facts found." (Citations omitted; internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Giamattei</EM> v.
<EM>DiCerbo,</EM> 135 Conn. 159, 162, 62 A.2d 519
(1948). Unless "[a] statement [by the court]
... suggest[s] that the court did not consider
[certain] testimony, we ... are entitled to
presume that the trial court acted properly
and considered all the evidence." (Internal
quotation marks omitted.) <EM>Moye</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner
of Correction,</EM> 168 Conn. App. 207, 229-30,
145 A.3d 362 (2016), cert. denied, 324
Conn. 905, 153 A.3d 653 (2017). We will thus
not presume, from the habeas court's failure
to mention Satti's comments during the October
9, 1997 hearing in its memorandum of
decision, that it disregarded those comments
in the course of ruling on the petitioner's
claim. Given the centrality of those comments
to the petitioner's case, however, we reiterate
that "[a] court should strive to avoid leaving
litigants with the impression that it has failed
to discharge its duty or somehow acted unlawfully
... [and should not] abrogate [its]
duty to review the evidence admitted at trial
or ... give litigants the erroneous impression
that [it has] done so." Id. at 235, 145 A.3d
362.

<fnt22> In his statement, St. Julien referred to St.
Victor and Hamilton as "Sammy" and "Bushwick,"
respectively. St. Victor was routinely
referred to as "Sammy" throughout the petitioner's
criminal proceedings.

<fnt23> The record reflects that St. Victor also
gave a statement to Martin. St. Victor gave
his statement one day after the incident at
issue, on May 12, 1996, and it is part of the
petitioner's criminal file. The petitioner did
not allege that McKay or any of the petitioner's
prior habeas counsel had actual knowledge
of St. Julien's October 22, 1997 statement;
the petitioner represented to the habeas
court that St. Julien's statement was not discovered
until 2022.

<fnt24> Although we decide the petitioner's claim
under <EM>Strickland</EM>'s prejudice prong, we note
that the habeas court's reasoning in concluding
that the petitioner had failed to establish
deficient performance runs contrary to precedent
from our Supreme Court. The habeas
court gave great weight to the fact that
McKay was unable to recall any details of the
petitioner's case and concluded that the petitioner
had accordingly failed to present sufficient
evidence of deficient performance. In
particular, the habeas court stated: "[B]eing
unable to elicit direct evidence on the information
counsel possessed <EM>at the time</EM> of the
representation and why he made certain decisions
<EM>at that time</EM> raises a hurdle making it
impossible for the petitioner to establish the
deficient performance prong of the <EM>Strickland</EM>
test." (Citations omitted; emphasis in original.)
The court further stated that "McKay's
lack of memory cannot be claimed as the
equivalent of presenting affirmative evidence
sufficient to overcome the presumption of
competent representation." However, in <EM>Jordan</EM>
v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 341 Conn.
279, 267 A.3d 120 (2021), which was decided
prior to the petitioner's habeas trial in the
present case, our Supreme Court expressly
disapproved of such reasoning, holding that,
when trial counsel is unavailable to testify at
a habeas trial, "requiring [a] habeas petitioner
... to [nonetheless] provide evidence of
counsel's subjective state of mind would undoubtedly
and impermissibly heighten the petitioner's
burden under <EM>Strickland.</EM>" (Emphasis
omitted.) Id. at 291, 267 A.3d 120. Our
Supreme Court further held that, "[i]n that
circumstance, as always, the court must contemplate
the possible strategic reasons that
might have supported the challenged action
and then consider whether those reasons
were <EM>objectively</EM> reasonable." (Emphasis added.)
Id. at 290, 267 A.3d 120. As the court in
<EM>Jordan</EM> has made clear, it was improper for
the habeas court to rely on McKay's unavailability
&mdash;that is, on his lack of memory; see
<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Schiappa,</EM> 248 Conn. 132, 140-41,
728 A.2d 466, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 862, 120
S. Ct. 152, 145 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1999)&mdash;in concluding
that the petitioner had failed to establish
deficient performance, without considering
whether there were any objectively
reasonable strategic reasons for counsel's actions
or inactions.

<fnt25> General Statutes &sect; 52-270 (a) provides in
relevant part: "The Superior Court may grant
a new trial of any action that may come
before it, for ... the discovery of new evidence
... or for other reasonable cause, according
to the usual rules in such cases...."

<P20>Section 52-270 is not the only mechanism
by which a defendant may move for a new
trial. Under Practice Book &sect; 42-53, formerly
&sect; 902, a defendant may also move for a new
trial "if it is required in the interests of justice."
However, the disclosure of St. Julien's
statement would not have provided the petitioner
a ground on which to seek a new trial
under this latter provision because a motion
under Practice Book &sect; 42-53 may not be
based on newly discovered evidence. See
<EM>State</EM> v. <EM>Legrande,</EM> 60 Conn. App. 408, 419, 759
A.2d 1027 (2000), cert. denied, 255 Conn.
925, 767 A.2d 99 (2001).

<fnt26> Because the petitioner does not argue on
appeal that he could have used St. Julien's
statement to secure a more favorable sentence,
we do not consider the impact, if any,
that St. Julien's statement might have had on
the petitioner's punishment. Although the petitioner
does not <EM>explicitly</EM> argue on appeal
that he could have used St. Julien's statement
as the predicate for a new trial motion, we
think it is nonetheless appropriate to consider
the statement's materiality for that purpose
because the petitioner's brief focuses on the
statement's materiality as to his guilt of the
crimes charged. Because a motion for a new
trial based on newly discovered evidence also
evaluates whether that evidence might have
resulted in a not guilty verdict (albeit using a
slightly less lenient standard of probability
than that used for <EM>Brady</EM> claims), the petitioner's
arguments as to materiality are adequate
for us to evaluate whether St. Julien's statement
would have resulted in a new trial. See
<EM>Jones</EM> v. <EM>State,</EM> 328 Conn. 84, 102-103, 177
A.3d 534 (2018) (comparing standard for materiality
under <EM>Brady</EM> with standard for ruling
on motion for new trial).

<fnt27> Indeed, although the habeas court at times
purported to evaluate the statement's credibility
without the benefit of live testimony from
St. Julien, it also wrote that "it is not possible
to assess the substance and impact of that
statement without the ability to evaluate St.
Julien's demeanor and credibility, and to see
how he would hold up under cross-examination."

<fnt28> When our Supreme Court decided <EM>Kaddah</EM>
v. <EM>Commissioner of Correction,</EM> 324 Conn. 548,
570-71, 153 A.3d 1233 (2017), holding that a
petitioner may bring a habeas petition predicated
on ineffective assistance of <EM>second</EM> habeas
counsel, it expressed no view as to the
availability of a claim of ineffective assistance
against third habeas counsel and beyond. See
id. at 570 n.19, 153 A.3d 1233. Nevertheless,
since <EM>Kaddah,</EM> this court has on at least one
occasion ruled on the merits of a claim of
ineffective assistance of a petitioner's third
habeas counsel; see <EM>Tatum</EM> v. <EM>Commissioner of
Correction,</EM> supra, 211 Conn. App. at 75-76,
272 A.3d 218; and for the purposes of this
appeal, we assume without deciding that the
petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance
against Goddard and Waldron is one for
which habeas corpus relief is available.

<P20>This case returns to us following the
remand ordered in <EM>GMAT Legal Title
Trust 2014-1, U.S. Bank, National Assn.</EM>
v. <EM>Catale,</EM> 221 Conn. App. 90, 300 A.3d
1218, cert. denied, 348 Conn. 928, 305 A.3d
265 (2023), in which this court, inter alia,
affirmed the trial court's judgment of
strict foreclosure and remanded the case
to that court for the purpose of setting
new law days. See id., at 113, 300 A.3d
1218. Upon remand, on December 21, 2023,
the substitute plaintiff, RMS Series Trust
2020-1,<fnr1> filed a motion to reset the law
days. On January 8, 2024, the defendants
Vito Catale and Maria Catale<fnr2> objected to
<Page 1057>
the motion to reset the law days, arguing
that the plaintiff had not filed a new appraisal
<SPage 708>
report within 120 days of the
new judgment or an updated foreclosure
worksheet. On January 8, 2024, the trial
court granted the plaintiff's motion&mdash;after
"reviewing the plaintiff's motion, the court
file and [there being] no objection thereto"
&mdash;and set the law days to commence on
February 6, 2024. On January 12, 2024, the
defendants filed a motion to reargue, requesting
that the court reconsider its decision
because the language in the order
indicating that there was "no objection
thereto" was incorrect. The plaintiff filed
an objection; the defendants' reply and the
plaintiff's surreply followed. On January
26, 2024, the court denied the motion to
reargue, quoting this court's remand order;
see <EM>GMAT Legal Title Trust 2014-1,
U.S. Bank, National Assn.</EM> v. <EM>Catale,</EM> supra,
at 113, 300 A.3d 1218; and stating that
"[t]he only issue before the court was to
reset the law day, which it did." This appeal
followed.

<P20>On July 17, 2024, this court ordered, sua
sponte, the parties to file memoranda addressing
"whether the January 8, 2024
judgment resetting the law day should be
summarily reversed and the case remanded
for the purpose of making new findings
as to the amount of the debt and the fair
market value of the property, for the setting
of new law days or a sale date, and for
other proceedings according to law pursuant
to <EM>Wahba</EM> v. <EM>JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A.,</EM> 349 Conn. 483, [316 A.3d 338]
(2024)." The parties subsequently filed
memoranda in accordance with our order.
Although the parties agree that the case
must be remanded, they disagree as to the
parameters of the remand.

<P20>In <EM>Wahba</EM> v. <EM>JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A.,</EM> supra, 349 Conn. 483, 316 A.3d 338,
our Supreme Court concluded: "[A] judgment
of strict foreclosure is uniquely susceptible
to becoming ineffective and stale
over the course of time. Law days pass,
the amount of the debt changes, and the
property's value fluctuates. It is also axiomatic
that foreclosure is peculiarly an equitable
action....
<SPage 709>
Thus, when an appellate
court has affirmed a judgment of
strict foreclosure and remanded the case
to the trial court with direction to set new
law days&mdash;perhaps years after the original
judgment&mdash;we deem it necessary, unless
expressly prohibited for some reason by
the reviewing court's remand order, for
the trial court to make a new finding as to
the amount of the debt so that the parties
know what the mortgagor must pay to
redeem the property.... That being the
case, we see no reason why, if the mortgagor
makes an adequate proffer, equity
would not also demand that the court determine
the property's current value so
that the court knows whether a strict foreclosure
would result in potential windfall to
the mortgagee. And, if a windfall to the
mortgagee would result, we also see no
reason why, in an appropriate case, equity
would not demand that the court exercise
its discretion and determine whether to
modify the form of the judgment and to
order a foreclosure by sale." (Citations
omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)
Id., at 498-99, 316 A.3d 338.

<P20>Applying these principles to the present
action, we summarily reverse the January
8, 2024 judgment resetting the law day and
remand the case for further proceedings
pursuant to <EM>Wahba</EM> v. <EM>JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A.,</EM> supra, 349 Conn. 483, 316 A.3d
338, and in accordance with the rescript
herein.

<P20>The January 8, 2024 judgment resetting
the law day is summarily reversed and the
case is remanded for the purpose of making
updated findings as to the amount of
the debt and the fair market value of the
property, to set new law days or a sale
date, and for other proceedings according
<Page 1058>
to law pursuant to <EM>Wahba</EM> v. <EM>JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.,</EM> supra, 349 Conn. 483,
316 A.3d 338; the indebtedness established
in the initial judgment of strict foreclosure
shall be treated as proven and established
and any calculations changing the amount
of the debt shall be based solely on additional
debt incurred or payments made by
the defendants after the initial judgment.
<FN>
<fnt1> On August 4, 2021, RMS Series Trust 2020-1
filed a motion to substitute itself for the
original plaintiff, GMAT Legal Title Trust
2014-1, U.S. Bank National Association, as
Legal Title Trustee, after the subject note and
mortgage were assigned to it. The trial court
granted the motion to substitute on August
23, 2021. Accordingly, all references to the
plaintiff in this order are to RMS Series Trust
2020-1.

<fnt2> Because Vito Catale and Maria Catale are
the only defendants appealing, we refer to
them as the defendants.

<CN><EM>INTRODUCTION</EM>

<P20>This appeal follows a half-day trial on a
paper record where the Court of Chancery
determined, pursuant to 8 <EM>Del. C.</EM> &sect; 225,
that Timothy R. Pohl ("Pohl") was the sole
director and officer of Byju's Alpha, Inc.
("Byju's Alpha"). Byju's Alpha is a wholly-owned
Delaware subsidiary of Think and
Learn Private Ltd. ("T&L"), a company
founded by Byju Ravindran and organized
under Indian law. On November 24, 2021,
Byju's Alpha and its guarantors, including
T&L, entered into a credit and guaranty
agreement to govern the terms of a loan
facility providing an aggregate principal
amount of $1.2 billion (the "Term Loans")
to Byju's Alpha. The counterparties were
GLAS Trust Company LLC ("GLAS"), in
its capacity as administrative and collateral
agent, and following the loan's syndication,
thirty-seven other lenders (the "Lenders").
The Lenders believed an event of default
had occurred. They had their agent,
GLAS, take control and install Pohl as the
<Page 1064>
sole director and officer. T&L's subsidiaries
&mdash; Byju's Alpha and Tangible Play, Inc.
("Tangible") &mdash; claim that there was no
event of default. Therefore, they argue
that fellow Appellant, Riju Ravindran, who
served as Byju's Alpha's sole director and
officer from its formation, remains the sole
director and officer of Byju's Alpha &mdash; not
Pohl.

<P20>This case requires us to address three
main issues. <EM>First,</EM> is the application of the
credit agreement's forum selection clause
properly before this court? <EM>Second,</EM> did an
agreement between the parties require
Whitehat Education Technology Private
Ltd. ("Whitehat") &mdash; a subsidiary of T&L &mdash;
to become a guarantor and, if so, was
GLAS justified in exercising its default
rights? And <EM>third,</EM> can Appellants successfully
assert an impossibility defense on the
grounds that it was unforeseeable that the
Reserve Bank of India (the "RBI") &mdash; which
sets the regulations for large overseas
lending agreements and approves who may
serve as a guarantor under those agreements
&mdash; would remove the exception that
allowed Whitehat to serve as a guarantor?
For the reasons set forth herein, we AFFIRM
the decision of the Court of Chancery.

<CN><EM>I. RELEVANT FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL
BACKGROUND</EM>

<HN24><EM>A. The Parties</EM>

<P20>Defendants Below-Appellants are Riju
Ravindran, Byju's Alpha, and Tangible
(collectively, "Appellants"). Byju's Alpha is
incorporated in Delaware and has its principal
place of business in Illinois.<fnr1> Byju's
Alpha was formed for financing purposes
and never had any active business operations.<fnr2>
Byju's Alpha was incorporated two
months prior to the execution of the credit
and guaranty agreement (the "Credit
Agreement"). On September 27, 2021, Ravindran
was appointed as the sole director
and officer of Byju's Alpha.<fnr3> Tangible is a
Delaware corporation with its principal
place of business in California.<fnr4> Non-party
T&L is an education technology company
formed under Indian law.<fnr5> Biju's Alpha
and Tangible are wholly-owned subsidiaries
of T&L. T&L was founded by Byju
Ravindran &mdash; the older brother of Appellant
Ravindran.<fnr6> Byju's Alpha, Tangible, and
Whitehat,<fnr7> are all subsidiaries of T&L.<fnr8>

<P20>Plaintiffs Below-Appellees are GLAS
and Timothy R. Pohl (collectively, "Appellees").
GLAS is a New Hampshire LLC
<Page 1065>
with its principal place of business in New
Jersey.<fnr9>

<HN24><EM>B. The Credit Agreement</EM>

<P20>On November 24, 2021, T&L, Byju's Alpha,
GLAS, and others entered into the
Credit Agreement.<fnr10> T&L served as the
Parent Guarantor, Byju's Alpha as the
borrower, and GLAS as the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent.<fnr11> The
Credit Agreement set forth the terms for a
loan providing an aggregate principal
amount of $1.2 billion to Byju's Alpha (the
"Term Loans").<fnr12> Byju's Alpha was expected
to pay back the Term Loans in quarterly
installments of .25% of the aggregate
principal, with the remainder of the principal
due, absent an acceleration, on the
Term Loans' maturity date.<fnr13> A syndicate
of thirty-seven financial institutions bought
the Term Loans providing the $1.2 billion.<fnr14>
The Lenders were given the ability
to buy and sell the loans and loan commitments.<fnr15>
Lenders who represented more
than fifty percent of the total outstanding
loan commitments under the Credit Agreement
were defined as "Required Lenders."<fnr16>

<P20>In the event of default, GLAS, at the
request of the Required Lenders, could act
to enforce the Lenders' rights.<fnr17> The loan
documents included a pledge agreement
and a security agreement. The pledge
agreement was entered into between
GLAS and Byju's Alpha's affiliate and
pledged 100% of Byju's Alpha's common
stock as collateral for the Term Loans.<fnr18> It
entitled GLAS to take control of those
shares upon the occurrence of a "trigger
event." GLAS's service of a default notice
constitutes a "trigger event" as defined by
the pledge agreement.<fnr19>

<P20>At the time of the Credit Agreement's
execution, three subsidiaries of T&L, consisting
of Tangible and two non-parties,
entered into the agreement and were referred
to as the "Initial Guarantor[s]."<fnr20>
The Credit Agreement contains language
discussing Whitehat acceding to the Credit
Agreement as a guarantor after receiving
approval from the RBI.<fnr21>

<HN24><EM>C. Overseas Direct Investment Regulations</EM>

<P20>The RBI sets the regulations for Overseas
Direct Investment ("ODI"). The ODI
<Page 1066>
regulations, which are revised periodically,
determine who can serve as a guarantor
with the RBI's approval. When the Credit
Agreement was negotiated and executed,
the RBI had been operating under the
same ODI regulations since 2004 (the
"Former ODI Regulations").<fnr22> ODI regulations
require the approval of the RBI before
an Indian entity can provide an overseas
guarantee when the loan exceeds $1
billion in any financial year (the "Amount
Test"), or the loan exceeds 400% of the net
worth of the guarantor (the "Net Worth
Test").<fnr23> Because the loans exceeded $1
billion, Whitehat and T&L were required
to receive RBI approval prior to becoming
guarantors.<fnr24> Because Whitehat's calculated
net worth at the time of the negotiations
was negative,<fnr25> it failed to satisfy the
Net Worth Test. However, the Former
ODI Regulations allowed a subsidiary to
rely on &mdash; and in effect "borrow" from &mdash; its
parent entity's net worth to satisfy the Net
Worth Test (the "Borrowing Exception").<fnr26>
T&L then acquired Whitehat in August
2020 for $300 million.<fnr27>

<P20>The Credit Agreement contains multiple
covenants concerning the approval from
the RBI. The key covenants are: (i) Section
5.9(c), which addresses Whitehat acceding
to the Credit Agreement; (ii) Section
5.17(d), which addresses T&L's role in
helping Whitehat accede; and (iii) Section
5.1, which requires the regular submission
of financial reports. Section 5.9(c) provides
that "[o]n and from the earlier of (i) April
1, 2022 and (ii) within five Business Days
of the date RBI approval is received,
Whitehat ... shall accede to [the Credit
Agreement] and the Onshore Guarantee
Deed as a Guarantor[.]"<fnr28> Section 5.17(d)
requires that T&L use commercially reasonable
efforts to secure RBI approval on
or before April 1, 2022:

<B22>[T&L] will use its <EM>reasonable commercial
efforts</EM> to procure the RBI approval
on or prior to April 1, 2022 in order that
it and Whitehat India may guarantee
the Covered Obligations in an amount
not less than the Guarantee Maintenance
Amount and if so obtained, shall
ensure that it and Whitehat India guarantee
... the Covered Obligations up to
the maximum amount permitted by the
RBI Approval. For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) any failure to obtain the RBI
approval prior to April 1, 2022 (whether
in whole or in part) <EM>shall not cause a
breach</EM> of the Guarantee Maintenance
Requirement or require any mandatory
prepayment of the Term Loans....<fnr29>

<HN24><EM>D. Events of Default</EM>

<P20>Section 8.1 of the Credit Agreement defines
the "Events of Default."<fnr30> Section
8.1(e), recognizes that an event of default
occurs when:

<B22>[A]ny Loan Party shall fail to observe or
perform any covenant, condition or
agreement contained in any of the Loan
<Page 1067>
Documents ... and such failure shall
continue unremedied for a period of 45
days after notice thereof from [GLAS]
to [Byju's Alpha] (which notice will be
given at the request of any Lender.)<fnr31>

<P00>Thus, in the event of default, GLAS may,
upon the request of the Lenders, deliver to
Byju's Alpha a notice of acceleration and
default.<fnr32> GLAS would then inform Byju's
Alpha that it is exercising its contractual
remedies on the Lenders' behalf, including:
"[e]nforc[ing] any and all Liens and security
interests created pursuant to the Collateral
Documents in addition to any other
remedies available under the Loan Documents
or applicable law."<fnr33>

<P20>These additional remedies include exercising
the Pledge Agreement entered into
by GLAS and Byju's Alpha's affiliates.<fnr34>
One thousand shares of common stock,
accounting for 100% of Byju's Alpha's equity,
was pledged as collateral under the
Credit Agreement.<fnr35> If a "trigger event"
occurs, GLAS is entitled to take control of
Byju's Alpha's equity.<fnr36> The service of a
default notice by GLAS to Byju's Alpha
constitutes a "trigger event" under the
Pledge Agreement.<fnr37> In addition, a "trigger
event" grants GLAS a power of attorney
under Security Agreement Section
19.1.<fnr38> This allows GLAS "to exercise any
of the rights conferred on [GLAS] in relation
to the Collateral Assets or under any
Loan Document or under any law."<fnr39>

<P20>For instance, Section 5.1 of the Credit
Agreement requires T&L to provide both
unaudited quarterly financial statements
and audited financial statements at specific
intervals.<fnr40> Failing to deliver these statements
constitutes an "event of default" if
the failure would "continue unremedied for
a period of 45 days."<fnr41> However, the failure
may be cured at any time prior to the
delivery of a default notice.<fnr42> When an
event of default occurs, the Required
Lenders may request the delivery of a
default notice. Upon GLAS's delivery of
the notice, the outstanding loan balance
becomes immediately due and payable.<fnr43>

<HN24><EM>E. Attempted Approval and First
Limited Waiver</EM>

<P20>At the time of executing the Credit
Agreement on November 24, 2021, the
RBI had not approved either party to
serve as a guarantor. Three months earlier,
<Page 1068>
on August 9, 2021, the RBI posted for
feedback two proposed drafts that amended
the Former ODI Regulations (the "Proposed
ODI Regulations").<fnr44> The Borrowing
Exception was absent from the Proposed
ODI Regulations.<fnr45>

<P20>On February 11, 2022, DBS Bank, an
authorized dealer on behalf of T&L, drafted
an application seeking the RBI's approval
for T&L and Whitehat to serve as
guarantors.<fnr46> While waiting for approval,
on March 16, 2022, T&L failed to provide
its third-quarter financial statements to
Lenders pursuant to Section 5.1 of the
Credit Agreement.<fnr47> On March 29, 2022,
T&L received approval from the RBI to
serve as a guarantor, while Whitehat did
not.<fnr48> In response, the parties modified the
contract around Whitehat's lack of approval.
That same day, T&L circulated to
Lenders, via GLAS, a proposed waiver
(the "First Limited Waiver").<fnr49> The Lenders
agreed to the waiver and executed it
on April 5, 2022.<fnr50>

<P20>The First Limited Waiver delayed the
date for Whitehat to accede to the Credit
Agreement as a guarantor to "October 8,
2022 and such later date as is agreed in
writing by the [Required Lenders]...."<fnr51>
Although Whitehat failed to accede to the
Credit Agreement, the First Limited
Waiver acknowledged that T&L had "used
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such RBI Approval on or prior to April 1,
2022," and had exerted "significant efforts
(including but not limited to commercially
reasonable efforts) ... to obtain the RBI's
approval on or prior to April 1, 2022 to
permit Whitehat India to guarantee the
Covered Obligations[.]"<fnr52>

<HN24><EM>F. The Second, Third, and Seventh
Amendments</EM>

<P20>The First Limited Waiver was not the
end of the changes to the Credit Agreement.
Before the new deadline of October
8, 2022, the RBI adopted new ODI regulations
on August 22, 2022 that discontinued
the Borrowing Exception (the "New ODI
Regulations").<fnr53> During this time, T&L
failed, once again, to provide the required
financial statements pursuant to Section
5.1. This included failing to provide the
financial statements for its first fiscal
quarter on August 14, 2022.<fnr54> As of October
8, Whitehat still had not become a
guarantor.<fnr55> In response, on October 12,
<Page 1069>
2022, the parties executed the second
amendment to the Credit Agreement (the
"Second Amendment").<fnr56> The date for
Whitehat to accede to the Credit Agreement
would be moved to November 24,
2022. The Second Amendment to the Credit
Agreement amended Section 1.1 to include
the following definition of "Specified
Defaults":<fnr57>

<P20>"Specified Defaults" means any or all of
the following:

<B24>(a) the failure to deliver to [GLAS], as
required under Section 5.1(a), the
audited financials and other information
for the fiscal year of the
Parent Guarantor ended March 31,
2022.

<B24>(b) the failure to deliver to [GLAS], as
required under Section 5.1(b), the
full and complete unaudited financials
and other information (including
the comparative figures for the
relevant corresponding fiscal quarter
in the relevant previous fiscal
year) for each of the fiscal quarters
of the Parent Guarantor ended December
31, 2021, and June 30, 2022;
and/or

<B24>(c) the failure of Whitehat India to accede
to this Agreement and the Onshore
Guarantee Deed as a Guarantor,
as required under Section
5.9(c), and to otherwise comply with
the other requirements under Section
5.9(c).<fnr58>

<P00>The Second Amendment also amended
Section 8.1(e) by providing that the Specified
Defaults would have a 45-day cure
period, expiring November 24, 2022, at
which point any uncured Specified Default
would mature into an Event of Default
permitting GLAS to enforce remedies.<fnr59>

<P20>The first anniversary of the Credit
Agreement, November 24, 2022, arrived
and the Specified Defaults had not been
cured.<fnr60> This led to the creation of the
third amendment (the "Third Amendment")
in which T&L, along with the rest
of the Guarantors and the Required Lenders,
agreed not to deliver the Specified
Notice of Acceleration before December 2,
2022.<fnr61> However, the Third Amendment
acknowledged that:

<B22>[T]he Cure Period for each of the Specified
Defaults referred to in the Amendment
No. 2 will expire or has expired on
November 24, 2022, without any of the
Specified Defaults being cured by the
Loan Parties, and (ii) the Required
Lenders will be or are therefore entitled
to, on and from November 25, 2022,
request [GLAS] to deliver to the Loan
Parties the Specified Notice of Default
and Acceleration.<fnr62>

<P00>Following more amendments, the Credit
Agreement was amended for the seventh
time on January 6, 2023 (the "Seventh
Amendment").<fnr63> The amendment acknowledged
that the Cure Period had expired on
November 24, 2022.<fnr64> The only way to
<Page 1070>
cure now was through a waiver by the
Required Lenders. However, the Lenders
agreed to delay GLAS's delivery of a default
notice until at least February 10,
2023.<fnr65> Three weeks later, on March 3,
2023, the Required Lenders requested that
GLAS deliver to T&L a default notice.<fnr66>
That same day on March 3, 2023, GLAS
delivered the notice to T&L.

<HN24><EM>G. GLAS and Pohl's Actions After the
Default Notice</EM>

<P20>After the notice had been delivered,
GLAS took a series of actions on behalf of
the Lenders with the goal of obtaining
control over Byju's Alpha. GLAS started
by exercising its rights under the Pledge
Agreement and the Security Agreement to
take control of Byju's Alpha's outstanding
common stock. GLAS transferred 1,000
common shares of Byju's Alpha &mdash; representing
100% of Byju's Alpha's equity &mdash; to
GLAS's name. In addition, GLAS executed
"an Irrevocable Proxy memorializing its
power to serve as [Byju's Alpha's parent
company's] `attorney-in-fact' and voted the
pledged shares on [Byju's Alpha's parent
company's behalf]...."<fnr67>

<P20>After GLAS believed that it had secured
control over Byju's Alpha, GLAS and Pohl
executed written consents to secure Pohl's
position as sole director and officer of
Byju's Alpha. GLAS, in its capacity as sole
stockholder, acted by written consent to
amend the company's bylaws to grant its
stockholders the power to fix the size of
the company's board of directors.<fnr68> Then,
GLAS in its capacity as sole stockholder,
acted by written consent to give the company's
stockholders the power to fill board
vacancies by written consent. GLAS again,
as sole stockholder, acted by written consent
to remove Ravindran as Byju's Alpha's
sole director. It also acted by written
consent to appoint Pohl to fill the board
vacancy. On March 3, after GLAS took the
foregoing actions, Pohl acted by written
consent, as Byju's Alpha's sole director, to
remove all of the company's officers.<fnr69> Two
months later, on May 3, 2023, GLAS and
Pohl filed a complaint in the Court of
Chancery, pursuant to Section 225, seeking
a declaration that their actions taken by
written consent were valid.

<HN24><EM>H. Proceedings in the Court of Chancery</EM>

<CN><EM>1. Pre-trial Motions and Proceedings</EM>

<P20>GLAS and Pohl filed a motion for expedited
proceedings and for entry of a <EM>status
quo</EM> order. After a telephonic hearing, the
Court of Chancery, on May 18, 2023,
granted the motion for expedited proceedings
and a <EM>status quo</EM> order.<fnr70> The <EM>status
quo</EM> order provided that Pohl would continue
to serve as sole officer and director of
the Company.<fnr71>

<P20>On May 30, 2023, Appellants filed their
Answer to the Verified Complaint.<fnr72> The
<Page 1071>
following week on June 5, 2023, T&L and
Tangible, along with other non-parties,
filed a complaint in a New York state court
against GLAS (the "New York Action").<fnr73>
They sought a declaratory judgment that
there was no event of default.<fnr74> They also
alleged damages related to various breaches
and interference with business relations.

<CN><EM>2. Findings on Forum and Standing</EM>

<P20>The Court of Chancery held a trial on
August 4, 2023 and delivered a thoughtful
Bench Ruling in favor of GLAS and Pohl
on November 2, 2023. Pohl sought to validate
six actions taken by himself and
GLAS.<fnr75> However, acknowledging Section
225's summary nature, the trial court
deemed five of the six within the scope of
Section 225 but deemed GLAS's written
consent amending Byju's Alpha's bylaws to
be beyond the scope of the proceeding.
The trial court first held that Appellants'
pre-trial brief did not adequately address
the issue of whether non-signatory Pohl
was bound by the forum selection clause of
the Credit Agreement, and that the issue,
therefore, had been waived.

<CN><EM>3. Findings on the Whitehat Guarantee</EM>

<P20>The Court of Chancery considered the
substantive challenges involving the Credit
Agreement next.

<CN><EM>a. The Plain Language Interpretation
of the Covenants</EM>

<P20>The Credit Agreement contains a New
York choice-of-law provision.<fnr76> In keeping
with this provision, the Vice Chancellor
cited New York case law in interpreting
the agreement.<fnr77> The case law cited by the
Vice Chancellor favored an interpretation
of a contract that "does not render any
part of the agreement superfluous or
meaningless."<fnr78> The court analyzed Article
V of the Credit Agreement and focused on
Section 5.9(c)'s plain language. It concluded
that Article V contained affirmative
covenants that bind the loan parties. To
illustrate, Article V, entitled "Affirmative
Covenants," and Section 5.9, together,
state in relevant part:

<B22>Until the Term Commitments have expired
or been terminated and all Obligations
... shall have been paid in full
in cash, each Loan Party covenants and
agrees with the lenders that:

<B22>....

<B22>On and from the earlier of (i) April 1,
2022 and (ii) within five Business Days
of the date RBI Approval is received,
Whitehat ... shall accede to this Agreement
and the Onshore Guarantee Deed
as a Guarantor[.]<fnr79>

<P00>The Vice Chancellor interpreted Section
5.9(c) to require Whitehat to accede as a
guarantor on or before April 1, 2022.<fnr80>
<Page 1072>
Further, the April 1 deadline was "a hard
deadline" that was not conditioned on the
receipt of RBI approval.<fnr81>

<P20>The trial court agreed with Appellants
that Section 5.9(c) is different from other
covenants in the Credit Agreement because
breach of that covenant is the result
of a nonparty's action or inaction.<fnr82> The
trial court relied on the notion that a contract
that is conditioned on events outside
of one's control does not affect its validity
or the consequences of its breach. The
Vice Chancellor found support for this position
in Justice Holmes' <EM>The Common
Law,</EM><fnr83> and Justice Souter's opinion in
<EM>United States v. Winstar Corp.</EM><fnr84> The Vice
Chancellor relied upon the following reference
by Justice Souter in <EM>Winstar</EM> to an
illustration of this point by Justice Holmes:

<B22>We read th[e] promise [at issue] as the
law of contracts has always treated
promises to provide something beyond
the promisor's absolute control, that is,
as a promise to insure the promisee
against loss arising from the promised
condition's nonoccurrence. Holmes's example
is famous: `[i]n the case of a binding
promise that it shall rain tomorrow,
the immediate legal effect of what the
promisor does is, that he takes the risk
of the event, within certain defined limits,
as between himself and the promissee.'
Holmes, The Common Law (1881),
in 3 The Collected of Justice Holmes 268
(S. Novick ed. 1995). Contracts like this
are especially appropriate in the world
of regulated industries, where the risk
that legal change will prevent the bargained-for
performance is always lurking
in the shadows.<fnr85>

<P00>The Vice Chancellor found further support
in Court of Chancery precedent that has
applied this principle. She cited to the
Court of Chancery's decisions in <EM>Symbiont.io,
Inc. v. Ipreo Holdings, LLC,</EM><fnr86> and
<EM>Alliance Data Systems Corp. v. Blackstone
Capital Partners V L.P.</EM><fnr87> The court in
<EM>Symbiont.io, Inc.</EM> observed that "`[a] party
can accept contractual consequences for
events beyond its control, including the
actions of entities that are not parties to
the contract,' and that `[t]he insurance industry
exists because of that basic proposition.'"<fnr88>
Even though these cases applied
Delaware law, the court found them to be
persuasive in interpreting the Credit
Agreement under the lens of New York
law.<fnr89>

<P20>Next, the Court of Chancery determined
that Section 5.17(d) and Section 5.9(c), did
not conflict with each other but, instead,
worked together.<fnr90> It interpreted Section
5.17(d) to require T&L use reasonable
commercial efforts to procure RBI approval
<EM>on or prior</EM> to April 1, 2022.<fnr91> The court
held that Section 5.17(d) made clear that
failure to do so would not require mandatory
prepayment of the loan under the
<Page 1073>
Credit Agreement.<fnr92> By contrast, the court
interpreted Section 5.9(c) to govern "only
on April 1, or after RBI approval is obtained."<fnr93>
Moreover, the efforts clause
"does not change, weaken, or nullify the
fact that the loan parties covenanted that
Whitehat would, in fact, accede and accept
the consequences if it did not."<fnr94> The Vice
Chancellor turned to two sources to support
this conclusion. The first was a treatise
&mdash; <EM>New York Contract Law</EM> &mdash; which the
Vice Chancellor quoted for the proposition
that "[a] best efforts requirement should
not be read as negating other clauses of
the contract but should be reconciled with
the other provisions."<fnr95> The second source
was <EM>Vestron, Inc. v. National Geographic
Society,</EM> which states that a "best efforts
requirement must be reconciled with other
clauses in the contract to the extent possible,
not used as a basis for negating
them."<fnr96>

<P20>The Court of Chancery highlighted other
support that required Whitehat to accede
under the Credit Agreement. For
example, it pointed to the provision that
"Whitehat's failure to accede to the onshore
guarantee deal by April 1 will <EMBI>not</EMBI>
give rise to a default if the guarantee
maintenance amount is satisfied absent
Whitehat's guarantee and other conditions
are met."<fnr97> The court reasoned that in
order for the provision to have a purpose
and not be superfluous, Whitehat's failure
to accede must have created a default under
the Credit Agreement.<fnr98> Because
Whitehat had not acceded, the loan parties
were in breach of an Article V covenant,
which could then mature into an event of
default under Section 8.1(e).<fnr99>

<CN><EM>b. Amendments and "Specified Default"</EM>

<P20>The court next determined that the Second,
Third and Seventh Amendments reinforced
that Whitehat's failure to obtain
RBI approval was an event of default.<fnr100>
<EM>First,</EM> the Second Amendment, executed
on October 12, 2022, added Specified Defaults
to Section 8.1(e).<fnr101> That amendment
gave T&L until November 24 to cure the
Specified Defaults. Thus, the Second
Amendment ensured that a failure to obtain
the Whitehat guarantee would be an
event of default.<fnr102>

<P20>The Third Amendment's recitals acknowledged
that T&L's failure to cure the
Specified Defaults entitled the Required
Lenders, on and from November 25, 2022,
to request GLAS to deliver to the Loan
Parties a default notice. The recitals also
reflected the Required Lenders' agreement
to refrain from requesting that
GLAS deliver a default notice before December
2, 2022, notwithstanding the expiration
of the cure period on November 24,
2022.<fnr103>
<Page 1074>

<P20><EM>Third,</EM> the Seventh Amendment, executed
on January 6, 2023, likewise made clear
that Whitehat's failure to accede was an
event of default. It provided that the Specified
Defaults could no longer be cured
unless the Required Lenders consented. It
stated in relevant part:

<P20>It is hereby acknowledged and agreed
by the parties hereto that:

<B22>(i) the Cure Period for any Specified
Defaults referred to in the Amendment
No. 2 expired on November 24, 2022,
without any of the Specified Defaults
being cured by the Loan Parties; and

<B22>(ii) none of the Specified Defaults as
referred to in the Amendment No. 2 can
be cured or remedied (or deemed to be
cured or remedied) following the date of
this Agreement other than by waiver by
the Required Lenders in accordance
with Section 10.2 of the Credit Agreement.<fnr104>

<P00>The Vice Chancellor concluded that the
Seventh Amendment was "a contractual
stipulation that Whitehat's failure as a
guarantor by November 24 to accede was
an event of default."<fnr105> The Vice Chancellor
also held that the amendment's lack of
curability and the reassertion of the right
to send a default notice to Byju's Alpha
supported her conclusion.<fnr106>

<P20>Thus, the Vice Chancellor determined
that Appellants' interpretation of the
Credit Agreement covenants as exclusively
requiring T&L use commercially reasonable
efforts to procure RBI approval, was
fatally flawed by "the credit agreement's
plain language <EM>and</EM> its subsequent amendments."<fnr107>
The trial court determined that
GLAS's and Pohl's actions were valid, unless
Appellants could successfully raise any
potential defenses.<fnr108>

<CN><EM>4. Findings on the Defenses</EM>

<CN><EM>a. Impossibility</EM>

<P20>The parties did not dispute that the New
ODI Regulations had removed the Borrowing
Exception which, in turn, made it
impossible for Whitehat to obtain RBI approval.
However, the parties disputed
whether the risk of the ODI regulations
changing was foreseeable.<fnr109> The Vice
Chancellor held that "[u]nder New York
law, a party may be relieved of its obligation
to perform where performance becomes
objectively impossible."<fnr110> The Vice
Chancellor also noted that this defense is
tightly constrained.<fnr111> The court cited the
standard set forth by the New York Court
of Appeals in <EM>Kel Kim Corp. v. Central
Markets, Inc.,</EM><fnr112> stating that "[i]mpossibility
will relieve a party of its obligations
only where, at the time of contracting, the
risk at issue was both unforeseeable and
<Page 1075>
unable to be guarded against in the contract."<fnr113>
The Vice Chancellor articulated
three principles of contract law that she
would apply in her analysis. <EM>First,</EM> the
burden is on the defendant to demonstrate
that performance is impossible.<fnr114> <EM>Second,</EM>
a change in law can render performance
impossible.<fnr115> <EM>Third,</EM> changes in law are
generally foreseeable.<fnr116>

<P20>To determine foreseeability, the court
examined the chronology of events, beginning
with August 22, 2021 &mdash; months before
the parties signed the Credit Agreement &mdash;
when the Proposed ODI Regulations were
posted for public comment.<fnr117> The Proposed
ODI Regulations were adopted a
year later on August 22, 2022. The Borrowing
Exception, which Whitehat relied
upon, was absent in both the proposed and
the subsequently enacted ODI regulations.
Pohl's expert witness stated that it was
reasonably foreseeable that the New ODI
Regulations would not contain the Borrowing
Exception because of its absence in the
Proposed ODI Regulations.<fnr118> By contrast,
the court determined that Appellants' expert
witness's opinion only supported the
notion that the change was not <EM>explicitly</EM>
noted in the Proposed ODI Regulations
and that this lack of a specific mention did
not render it unforeseeable.<fnr119>

<P20>In determining that the change in regulations
was foreseeable, the Vice Chancellor
relied upon <EM>Red Tree Investments,
LLC v. Petr&oacute;leos de Venezuela, S.A.,</EM><fnr120> a
decision applying a New York law. There,
the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York considered
an argument that an executive order imposing
sanctions on certain Venezuelan-related
entities, issued two weeks before
the contracting parties entered into certain
note and credit agreements, made a future
expansion of the order foreseeable. Later,
after the order was expanded to include
state-owned businesses, defendants (who
were instrumentalities of the Venezuelan
government) argued that the change in the
law rendered their performance impossible.

<P20>The federal court explained that under
New York law, "`[i]mpossibility excuses a
party's performance only when the destruction
of the subject matter of the contract
or the means of performance makes
performance objectively impossible.'"<fnr121>
Further, the impossibility must be the
product of "`an unanticipated event that
<Page 1076>
could not have been foreseen or guarded
against in the contract[.]'"<fnr122> It observed
that New York's highest state court, the
Court of Appeals, "has cautioned that the
impossibility defense should be `applied
narrowly, due in part to judicial recognition
that the purpose of contract law is to
allocate the risks that might affect performance
and that performance should be
excused only in extreme circumstances.'"<fnr123>
The federal court held that
because the expansion of the pre-existing
Venezuelan sanctions to include a state-owned
business and the risk-adverse reaction
of some members of the banking community
could have been foreseen and
guarded against in the contract, defendants
could not meet their burden of proof
on the affirmative defense of impossibility.

<P20>Guided by this precedent, the Court of
Chancery held that Appellants had failed
to establish that the change in Indian regulations
was unable to be guarded
against.<fnr124> In the court's view, the parties
had expressly allocated the risk that RBI
might not approve Whitehat by imposing
the April 1 deadline. The parties provided
that a default would occur if they failed to
get RBI approval. The court weighed the
fact that even after the New ODI Regulations
were in place (<EM>i.e.,</EM> when the parties
were aware that it would be impossible for
Whitehat to receive approval from the
RBI), the parties amended the contract
but still did not move the risk away from
the "loan parties."<fnr125> Accordingly, the Vice
Chancellor held that Appellants had failed
to carry their burden in establishing an
impossibility defense.

<CN><EM>b. Unclean Hands</EM>

<P20>In response to Appellants' unclean
hands defense, the Court of Chancery
questioned whether unclean hands, an equitable
defense, was available in a Section
225 action as a defense to a legal claim.
Regardless, the court reviewed the merits
of the defense, ultimately rejecting it.
<EM>First,</EM> the court determined that the case
was not an "end-run" around New York's
jurisdiction, as the court saw no evidence
that the action under the Delaware General
Corporation Law was filed "for any
nefarious purpose."<fnr126> <EM>Second,</EM> the willingness
of the Lenders to patiently wait and
forbear on the loans numerous times, even
after they had become entitled to sending
a default notice, cut against a finding of
unclean hands. <EM>Third,</EM> the court rejected
Appellants' argument that GLAS threatened
to violate an NDA and release Byju's
Alpha's confidential information. Specifically,
the court determined that the evidence
offered by Appellants, consisting of two
emails and testimony, was not adequate to
support Appellants' claims.<fnr127> <EM>Fourth,</EM> the
court held that Pohl did not violate the
<EM>status quo</EM> order by entering into a director
agreement with Byju's Alpha which
provided a monthly salary of $75,000 for
his services as sole director and officer.<fnr128>
<Page 1077>
This was because the director agreement
was executed before entry of the <EM>status
quo</EM> order. Therefore, Pohl, by accepting
those payments, operated consistently with
the <EM>status quo</EM> order.<fnr129>

<P20>Accordingly, the court held that Pohl's
and GLAS's actions were valid although it
held the issue of GLAS's written consent
determining the size of Byju's Alpha's
board was outside the scope of the action.
The Vice Chancellor then entered a final
order and judgment on November 13,
2023, granting relief for Appellees.

<HN24><EM>I. Contentions on Appeal</EM>

<P20>Following the Vice Chancellor's bench
ruling, Appellants filed an appeal to this
Court. They raise several contentions on
appeal. <EM>First,</EM> they argue that the trial
court erred by failing to address Appellants'
arguments that the action below
should have been dismissed in favor of the
pending New York Action &mdash; aligning with
the forum designated by the Credit Agreement's
forum selection clause. They contend
that the court erred in holding that
Appellants waived an argument that Pohl
was subject to that clause. <EM>Second,</EM> Appellants
contend that the trial court erred in
holding that the inability of T&L to procure
RBI Approval for Whitehat's additional
guarantee, notwithstanding its reasonable
commercial efforts to procure such
approval, constituted a breach of the Credit
Agreement. <EM>Third,</EM> and finally, they
maintain that the trial court erred in holding
that the inability of T&L to procure
RBI approval for Whitehat's additional
guarantee was not excused on the grounds
of legal impossibility.

<CN><EM>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</EM>

<P20>"This Court reviews a trial court's
finding of waiver under the standard of
plain error."<fnr130> "`In order for this Court to
find plain error, the error complained of
must be so clearly prejudicial to substantial
rights as to jeopardize the fairness and
integrity of the trial process.'"<fnr131>

<P20>This Court "review[s] questions
of contract interpretation <EM>de novo.</EM>"<fnr132>
"This Court reviews the Court of Chancery's
legal conclusions <EM>de novo</EM> but defers
to the Court of Chancery's factual findings
supported by the record."<fnr133>

<CN><EM>III. ANALYSIS</EM>

<HN24><EM>A. Whether Non-Signatory Pohl Was
Bound by the Forum Selection
Clause Was Not Fairly Presented
in the Proceedings Below</EM>

<P20>We first address whether the Court
of Chancery correctly held that Appellants
waived their argument that the Credit
Agreement's forum selection clause bound
Pohl &mdash; a non-signatory of the Credit
Agreement. Appellants contend that the
trial court erred by not dismissing this
action in favor of the New York action for
two reasons: <EM>First,</EM> Appellants' forum selection
clause arguments were fairly presented
in the proceedings below; and <EM>second,</EM>
the trial court failed to address any of
Appellants' forum selection clause arguments
in the Bench Ruling. The trial court
summarily dispensed with this issue in the
Bench Ruling as follows:
<Page 1078>

<B22>This Section 225 action has two plaintiffs:
Pohl, in his capacity as a purported
director and officer of BYJU's Alpha,
and GLAS as BYJU's Alpha's sole
stockholder. Defendants challenge
GLAS's ability to bring this claim in this
Court under the credit agreement's forum
selection clause.

<B22>But I need not resolve the forum selection
issue pertaining to GLAS. Defendants
have made no argument that Pohl
is bound by the forum selection clause.
He is a non-signatory, and defendants'
pretrial brief did not address whether
Pohl is bound by the credit agreement's
forum selection clause as such.

<B22><EM>Any such argument is therefore waived,
and I conclude the forum selection
clause does not bind Pohl.</EM> And as I will
explain, Pohl has standing to bring this
action. If Pohl can bring this action, then
this Court's judgment in rem will establish
the status of BYJU's Alpha's director
and officer seats to the exact
same extent as if GLAS had brought it.
I will consider the claim as presented by
Pohl.<fnr134>

<P00>Thus, according to the trial court, Appellants'
failure to specifically argue that Pohl
was bound by the forum selection clause
was dispositive.

<P20>"Under Supreme Court Rule 8
and general appellate practice, this Court
may not consider questions on appeal unless
they were first fairly presented to the
trial court for consideration."<fnr135> A "very
narrow" exception to Rule 8 allows this
Court to consider a "question for the first
time on appeal `when the interests of justice
so require.'"<fnr136> However, this exception
is "extremely limited" and invokes the
plain error standard of review.<fnr137> Under
that standard, if the error in question is
"`so clearly prejudicial to substantial
rights as to jeopardize the fairness and
integrity of the trial process,' then we may
consider that appellant's argument even
though he did not fairly present the argument
to the trial court for decision."<fnr138>
Here, the circumstances do not meet the
high threshold of the Rule 8 exception
under the plain error standard of review.
Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's
finding of waiver.

<P20>At oral argument, Appellants' counsel
stated that the "trial record" was the best
record evidence that this issue was not
waived.<fnr139> A closer review of the trial record,
however, does not support Appellants'
<Page 1079>
contention because at no point in the proceedings
below did Appellants' counsel explicitly
argue that Pohl was bound by the
forum selection clause because he was a
non-signatory. At the trial, Appellees'
counsel and the trial court engaged in a
lengthy discussion concerning whether
Pohl brought this suit in his individual
capacity or in his capacity as the director
of Byju's Alpha.<fnr140> In response to this discussion,
Appellants' attorney stated that
he would be "happy be to address [that
issue], but I think you're already there,
which is exactly right."<fnr141> This cursory
comment does not register as an argument
that is fairly presented to the trial court
for consideration as required by Rule 8.<fnr142>

<P20>Beyond the trial record, little exists
from the briefing or the <EM>status quo</EM> hearing
that supports Appellants' contention that
this issue was not waived. Appellants' brief
in opposition to Appellees' motion for a
<EM>status quo</EM> order did not address this specific
issue. Rather, it focused on the general
application of the forum selection clause,
not whether non-signatory Pohl was expressly
bound by it.<fnr143> At the subsequent
<EM>status quo</EM> hearing, the only mention of
Pohl in the context of this argument was
by Pohl's attorney.<fnr144> Appellants' attorney,
by contrast, merely repeated the general
application of the forum selection clause
arguments that were asserted in the pre-hearing
brief and did not specifically address
whether Pohl was bound by it.<fnr145>
Turning to Appellants' answer to the verified
complaint, their second affirmative defense
addressed only whether the forum
selection clause encompassed the claims in
the case, not whether Pohl was bound by
<Page 1080>
it: "[t]he Complaint should be dismissed
for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to the
exclusive New York forum selection clause
contained in the Credit Agreement."<fnr146>

<P20>The joint pre-trial order again emphasized
that the forum selection clause governed
the claims arising from the Credit
Agreement, not whether Pohl was specifically
bound by it: "Plaintiffs commenced
this action on May 3, 2023 even though the
Credit Agreement contains an exclusive
New York forum selection clause. <EM>New
York is the only jurisdiction in which the
totality of the parties' dispute concerning
these events, as well as their full legal
consequences, can be determined.</EM>"<fnr147> Although
Appellants point to a footnote in
their Pre-Trial brief, this footnote is insufficient.
It merely states that "Pohl (who
has brought the instant suit in his putative
capacity as `sole director' of Byju's Alpha)
is neither an Agent nor a Lender."<fnr148> This
point does not address the contention that
the forum provision does not apply because
Pohl is a non-signatory. Rather, it
appears to be addressed to the last sentence
of the forum selection clause which
allows any "Agent" or "Lender" to "bring
any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement ... in the courts of any jurisdiction[.]"<fnr149>

<P20>Appellants' citation to various examples
from the proceedings below where Pohl's
counsel suggested that he was not bound
by the forum selection provision does not
help them either.<fnr150> They suggest, by these
examples, that Pohl's counsel had sufficient
notice of this argument and could not
have been surprised. Yet despite Pohl's
counsel raising the argument, Appellants'
counsel never squarely responded to it.

<P20>Appellants' argument concerning the
lack of post-trial briefing fares little better.
Although the trial court did not request
any post-trial briefing,<fnr151> this does not absolve
Defendants from failing to make this
specific argument during trial or in their
pre-trial briefing. Defendants knew before
the trial that there was no post-trial briefing
unless requested by the court.<fnr152>
<Page 1081>
Therefore, they should have adequately
raised this issue before the trial's conclusion.<fnr153>

<P20>Appellants lean heavily on the unfair
surprise rationale for waiver rules but neglect
the other policies behind waiver &mdash;
namely, judicial economy and the value of
finality. Even if we assume Appellees were
not unfairly surprised by the forum selection
issue, Appellants' failure to join the
issue prevented the issue from being determined
by the trial court. Appellees and
the trial court took the time, effort, and
expense to litigate this case through extensive
briefing and a trial. We find it difficult
to see how judicial economy and finality
can square with requiring the parties to
retry the case, merely because Appellants
failed to address an issue which they now
claim is vital to this case. The narrow
exception to Rule 8 allows this Court to
consider a "question for the first time on
appeal `when the interests of justice so
require.'"<fnr154> After examining the record,
we cannot conclude that this threshold has
been met.

<HN02><EM>B. The Amendments Demonstrate That
Defendants Breached the Credit
Agreement</EM>

<P20>The next issue we address is
whether the trial court properly concluded
that Whitehat's failure to accede as a guarantor
constituted a breach of the Credit
Agreement, thereby allowing the Lenders
to seek remedies. Appellants make three
main arguments concerning this issue.
<EM>First,</EM> Section 5.9(c), by its own language,
does not obligate the Loan Parties to obtain
the accession of Whitehat; <EM>second,</EM> the
trial court misconstrued the relationship
between Sections 5.9(c) and 5.17 &mdash; rendering
the latter meaningless; and <EM>third</EM> any
breach was "trivial" in nature and the enforcement
of remedies would be "unconscionable."
We need not address these arguments,
however, because the Second,
Third, and Seventh Amendments to the
Credit Agreement foreclose Appellants'
other substantive arguments.

<P20>Read together, the Second, Third, and
Seventh Amendments to the Credit Agreement
make clear that Appellants voluntarily
conceded that Whitehat's failure to accede
as a guarantor was an explicit breach
of the Credit Agreement, thus entitling
GLAS to enforce its remedies. In the Second
Amendment, the parties defined
"Specified Defaults" to include "the failure
of Whitehat India to accede to this Agreement
and the Onshore Guarantee Deed as
a Guarantor, as required under Section
5.9(c), and to otherwise comply with the
other requirements under Section
5.9(c)."<fnr155> In the Third Amendment, the
parties acknowledged the following:

<B22>It is hereby acknowledged and agreed
by the parties hereto that (i) the Cure
Period for each of the Specified Defaults
referred to in the Amendment No. 2 will
expire or has expired on November 24,
2022, without any of the Specified Defaults
being cured by the Loan parties,
<Page 1082>
and (ii) the Required Lenders will be or
are therefore entitled to, on an from
November 25, 2022, request the Administrative
Agent to deliver to the Loan
Parties the Specified Notice of Default
and Acceleration.<fnr156>

<P00>Thus, the Third Amendment explicitly noted
that Whitehat's failure to accede to the
Credit Agreement as a guarantor had not
been cured. It emphasized further that the
Lenders were entitled to exercise remedies
through a notice of default and acceleration
with respect to that default.

<P20>Turning to the Seventh Amendment, we
agree with the trial court's conclusion that
the Seventh Amendment was a "contractual
stipulation that Whitehat's failure to
accede as a guarantor by November 24
was an event of default."<fnr157> The operative
language of the Seventh Amendment
makes this point clear:

<B42>(a) It is hereby acknowledged and
agreed by the parties hereto that:

<B22>(i) the Cure Period for any Specified
Defaults referred to in the Amendment
No. 2 expired on November 24, 2022,
without any of the Specified Defaults
being cured by the Loan Parties; and

<B22>(ii) notwithstanding any actions or otherwise
by the Parent Guarantor or any
other Person following the date of this
Agreement (including, without limitation,
the delivery to the Administrative
Agent of any relevant financial information
or statements the subject of any
Specified Default), none of the Specified
Defaults as referred to in the Amendment
No. 2 can be cured or remedied (or
deemed to be cured or remedied) following
the date of this Agreement other
than by waiver by the Required Lenders
in accordance with Section 10.2 of the
Credit Agreement.<fnr158>

<P00>The Seventh Amendment's discussion of
the inability to cure, other than by waiver
by the Required Lenders, necessarily suggests
that the Specified Defaults were
events of default that could be cured. We
agree with the trial court that the plain
language of the Second, Third, and Seventh
Amendments to the Credit Agreement
shows that Whitehat's failure to accede
as a guarantor constituted an event of
default which entitled GLAS to send a
default notice and seek remedies.

<P20>Appellants' arguments to the contrary
fall short. Appellants' main response, contained
in their reply brief, is that Appellants
never conceded that Whitehat's non-accession
constituted a "material breach"
of the Credit Agreement.<fnr159> This argument
is a stretch.<fnr160> The amendments explicitly
<Page 1083>
define Whitehat's failure to accede as a
"Specified Default."<fnr161> Moreover, the
amendments specify what will happen in
the event of a Specified Default. Thus,
although the amendments do not include
the word "material," the amendments still
specify that GLAS is entitled to exercise
its remedies.

<P20>Nor is this a situation where a sophisticated
party tricked an unsophisticated party
with fine print and legal jargon. The
amendments were contracts extensively
negotiated by sophisticated, well-counseled
parties and the several rounds of amendments
demonstrate an obvious, deliberate
effort by the parties to address this specific
issue. Accordingly, the parties are bound
by the terms of the Credit Agreement. For
these reasons, we need not address Appellants'
other substantive arguments because
they are foreclosed by the explicit language
of the Second, Third, and Seventh
Amendments to the Credit Agreement.

<HN24><EM>C. Appellants' Impossibility Defense is
Unavailing</EM>

<P20>The final issue we address is Appellants'
contention that the trial court
erred in holding that the inability of T&L
to procure RBI approval for Whitehat's
additional guarantee was not excused by
the grounds of legal impossibility. We
agree with the trial court's analysis and
conclusion.

<P20>To resolve this issue, we borrow
from the trial court's cogent analysis of
New York contract law. New York, like
Delaware,<fnr162> recognizes the defense of impossibility.
Under certain circumstances, a
party can be freed of its contractual obligations
when performance is rendered impossible.
However, as demonstrated by the
case law cited by the trial court, this defense
is tightly constrained as "[w]hile
such defenses may have been recognized
in the common law, they have been applied
narrowly, due in part to judicial recognition
that the purpose of contract law is to
allocate the risks that might affect performance
and that <EM>performance should be
excused only in extreme circumstances.</EM>"<fnr163>
<Page 1084>
In light of this narrow application, "[i]mpossibility
excuses a party's performance
only when the destruction of the subject
matter of the contract or the means of
performance makes performance objectively
impossible. Moreover, the impossibility
must be produced by <EM>an unanticipated
event that could not have been foreseen or
guarded against</EM> in the contract."<fnr164>

<P20>The trial court noted two other
aspects of the impossibility defense that
bear repeating. <EM>First,</EM> the burden is on the
party that invokes the affirmative defense
of impossibility to demonstrate that performance
is impossible.<fnr165> <EM>Second,</EM> although
a change in law can render performance
impossible, "[w]hen a change of law is
reasonably foreseeable at the time a contract
is entered into, impossibility of performance
is no defense."<fnr166>

<P20>We find it difficult to see the changes to
the ODI regulations as being unforeseeable
under this legal framework given the
sequence of events surrounding the execution
of the Credit Agreement and the
changes to the ODI regulations. The Credit
Agreement was executed on November
24, 2021, when the RBI operated under the
Former ODI Regulations.<fnr167> Because the
Former ODI Regulations allowed a subsidiary
to rely on, and in effect "borrow"
from, its parent entity's net worth to satisfy
the Net Worth Test via the Borrowing
Exception, the Former ODI Regulations
allowed Whitehat to satisfy the Net Worth
Test.<fnr168> However, three months before the
execution of the Credit Agreement, the
RBI, on August 9, 2021, publicly published
the Proposed ODI Regulations.<fnr169> The Borrowing
Exception was notably absent from
the Proposed ODI Regulations.<fnr170> The RBI
then adopted the New ODI Regulations on
August 22, 2022 &mdash; after the execution of
the Credit Agreement.<fnr171> Consistent with
the Proposed ODI Regulations, the New
ODI Regulations discontinued the Borrowing
Exception.<fnr172>

<P20>Given this sequence of events, it was
foreseeable at the time of executing the
Credit Agreement that the RBI might
eliminate the Borrowing Exception because
the RBI had already omitted it from
the publicly available Proposed ODI Regulations.
As these Proposed ODI Regulations
were released three months prior to
the execution of the Credit Agreement, we
struggle to believe that the sophisticated,
well-counseled parties for this billion-dollar
transaction could not have foreseen the
elimination of the Borrowing Exception. In
other words, the removal of the Borrowing
Exception was not an unforeseeable, "unanticipated
event that could not have been
foreseen or guarded against in the contract."<fnr173>
<Page 1085>

<P20>The declaration from GLAS and
Pohl's Indian law expert further supports
our view. The expert stated that the Proposed
ODI Regulations' omission of the
Borrowing Exception would have been understood
to mean that the Borrowing Exception
would be no longer recognized.<fnr174>
We are not convinced by Appellants' expert's
contrary view that the change was
not foreseeable because the removal of the
Borrowing Exception was not "apparent"
from the Proposed ODI Regulations because
the regulations did not "expressly
state" the change.<fnr175> Rather, we agree with
the trial court's conclusion that "[s]howing
that a change in law was not explicit does
not show that it was not foreseeable. The
change in law need not be explicitly spelled
out to be foreseeable."<fnr176>

<P20>The context of <EM>Red Tree</EM> is analogous to
the situation in this case and supports the
holding here. In <EM>Red Tree,</EM> which is summarized
earlier, the court rejected an impossibility
defense where an executive order
sanctioned certain Venezuelan persons
and entities several weeks before the parties
reached the agreement in dispute.<fnr177>
The court determined that a future expansion
of those sanctions was foreseeable and
that the defendants had failed to "guard[]
against the contingency of expansion of
sanctions."<fnr178> As a result, the <EM>Red Tree</EM>
defendants failed to meet the burden of
proof on the affirmative defense of impossibility.<fnr179>

<P20>Appellants' argument that <EM>Red Tree</EM> is
distinguishable because performance in
<EM>Red Tree</EM> was difficult, but not impossible,
falls flat. The <EM>Red Tree</EM> court mentioned
this as one rationale, but the court also
held that "[a]s alternative grounds for
granting summary judgment against
PDVSA, the Court concludes that defendants
have failed to demonstrate that the
sanctions were not reasonable foreseeable."<fnr180>
Appellants' second argument that
the Credit Agreement's silence on the issues
distinguishes the present case from
<EM>Red Tree</EM> also comes up short. Although
the <EM>Red Tree</EM> court acknowledged that the
agreement in that case expressly contemplated
the sanctions that rendered performance
impossible, the holding did not
turn on that point. Rather, the court held
that the impossibility defense failed because
the impossibility "could have been
foreseen and guarded against in the contract[.]"<fnr181>

<P20>Here, we hold that the elimination of the
borrowing exception "could have been
foreseen and guarded against."<fnr182> Although
no official law or executive order was promulgated
by the Indian government, the
RBI publicly signaled its intention to remove
the Borrowing Exception when it
<Page 1086>
published the Proposed ODI Regulations.
Accordingly, because the sophisticated,
well-counseled parties in this case failed to
guard against the very real possibility of
the Borrowing Exception's removal, Appellants
did not meet their burden of proof on
the affirmative defense of impossibility.<fnr183>

<P20>To summarize: (i) we need not decide
whether non-signatory Pohl is bound by
the forum selection clause because this
issue was not fairly presented below; (ii)
Appellees were entitled to exercise the
default remedies because Appellants conceded
the breach of the Credit Agreement
in the Second, Third, and Seventh Amendments
entitling GLAS to enforce its remedies;
and (iii) the defense of impossibility is
inapplicable because the change in the
ODI regulations was reasonably foreseeable.<fnr184>

<fnt139> In asserting that the trial record was the
best record evidence that this issue was not
waived, Appellants' counsel conceded at oral
argument that the briefing was "less strong"
evidence:

<B22><EMB>The Court:</EMB> What would you consider is
your best record evidence that this was not
waived. I know you have different things in
here, but what do you consider your strongest
evidence that it was it not [waived]?
<EMB>Appellants' Counsel:</EMB> I think the trial record.
There is probably, I want to estimate,
10 to 12, maybe 8 to 12, pages of back and
forth from the court. I think the test is
really was it fairly presented? I think the
proof is in the pudding [because] the other
side addressed the issue and so it was not a
surprise to them. It was before the court
knew the issue and the court had a discourse
about the issue, but I would say the
trial record admittedly is the strongest. The
briefing is less strong.

<P00>Oral Argument, at 7:58-8:37, <EMU>https://vimeo.com/982096660</EMU>.

<fnt140> Section 225 Trial Tr. 64:9-72:14. The following
exchange, which was highlighted in
Appellants' opening brief demonstrates that
Defendants, at trial, generally argued that
Pohl brought this suit not in his individual
capacity, but rather in his capacity as the
director of Byju's Alpha. Absent from this
exchange is any explicit argument addressing
whether Pohl was bound by the forum selection
clause despite being a non-signatory:

<B22><EMB>Defendants' Counsel:</EMB> Mr. Pohl is only here
because he claims to be a sole director and
officer of Byju's Alpha. He says so in paragraph
1 of the verified complaint. His sole
basis for acting is based on the validity of
the enforcement action, and that's an issue
to be determined in New York. He is here
as an agent of a party to the credit agreement,
a party that's bound by the exclusive
jurisdiction clause.

<B22><EMB>Court of Chancery:</EMB> Can you address the
argument that a 225 and the ability to bring
a 225 is bestowed on stockholders and directors,
it's not bestowed on the company.
<EMB>Defendants' Counsel:</EMB> Well, it's bestowed on
stockholders and directors, but he's only a
director of the company by virtue of him
exercising the pledge; otherwise, he's just a
private citizen. Either way, he's there
through the mechanics of the credit agreement
and the forum selection clause, which
said all of the parties, each of the parties,
agree to the exclusive jurisdiction. Also,
he's not really a necessary party to this
proceeding. They didn't really need to add
him. This could have been brought by
GLAS alone. And the fact that they added
him, I suspect, is so that they can make this
argument. But he's really not a necessary
party here.

<fnt160> The following exchange from oral argument
highlights Appellants' tenuous claim:

<B22><EMB>The Court:</EMB> Do we even need to go through
that analysis in view of the Second, Third,
and Seventh Amendments which make it
pretty clear there is an event of default.

<B22><EMB>Appellants' Counsel:</EMB> It is a good question
your Honor. In those amendments, I think
it is Amendment 2 has the defined term
"Specified Defaults." That is a defined
term. I think....

<B22><EMB>The Court:</EMB> Which includes the Whitehat
accession?

<B22><EMB>Appellants' Counsel:</EMB> It includes Whitehat
accession. It does not state that it is a
material breach. It says it is a "Specific
Default" and that they could send notice.
<EMB>The Court:</EMB> Is that your only argument because
it seems like a tough argument to
make when the parties go through at least
three of these amendments that deal expressly
with the Whitehat accession and say
it is a "Specified Default" entitling the
Lenders issue a notice of [acceleration of
default].

<B22><EMB>Appellants' Counsel:</EMB> Yeah, it is a tough
provision to deal with. But I would say that
the Lenders' counsel knew how to draft this
more precisely to state that this was a material
breach, and you had no defenses to it.
That was not done. It is a Specified Default
for purposes of the lender is not waving
their rights to send out notice. They were
extending, clearly from a practical standpoint.
They were trying to ... keep this
loan on the books and functioning but....
<EMB>The Court:</EMB> But the use of the word "material"
is not in here. I mean it says that, the
Seventh Amendment, for example, none of
the Specified Defaults [] referred to in
amendment number two can cured or
remedied following the date of this agreement
other than by waiver by the Required
Lenders. I mean that is pretty cut and dry,
isn't it?

<B22><EMB>Appellants' Counsel:</EMB> The language appears
to be cut and dry. I think under New York's
law about trivial breaches, I think there is
an argument that could made to the New
York courts that deal with these agreements
stating that "that's great, it can't be waived.
But was it really material which is a requirement.
Is it trivial is it non-monetary?"
The court would have to deal with that, but
this is a 225 case that ... was rapid and
narrowly tailored to a corporate dispute,
not this large credit agreement dispute that
was supposed to be in New York as we
argue.

[MJ]
<P20><author>HORTON</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>
[MT]
<P20>[&para;1] The Town of Kennebunkport appeals
from a judgment of the Superior
Court (York County, <EM>Mulhern, J.</EM>) vacating
the Town's denial of applications by 15
Langsford Owner LLC (15 Langsford) for
licenses under the Town's Short-Term
Rental Ordinance (STRO). In enacting the
STRO, the Town did not include any provision
allowing an appeal from the denial of
a license application, <EM>see</EM> Kennebunkport,
Me., Code ch. 129 (current through June 6,
2022), so we must determine whether the
denial of 15 Langsford's applications is
subject to direct review under Rule 80B of
the Maine Rules of Civil Procedure, which
ordinarily provides the "exclusive process"
<Page 1095>
for judicial review of municipal permitting
and licensing decisions, <EM>Gorham v. Androscoggin
Cnty.,</EM> 2011 ME 63, &para; 22, 21
A.3d 115. We conclude both that the
Town's decision is reviewable pursuant to
Rule 80B and that 15 Langsford was entitled
to the permits based on the undisputed
facts and the terms of the STRO. We
therefore affirm the judgment of the Superior
Court.

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<P20>[&para;2] "The following facts are drawn from
the Superior Court's decision and are supported
by the record." <EM>Hurricane Island
Found. v. Town of Vinalhaven,</EM> 2023 ME
33, &para; 2, 295 A.3d 147. Between December
2020 and June 2021, 15 Langsford acquired
eleven condominium units in Kennebunkport.
Units one through nine are
contained within a single structure, and
units ten and eleven each occupy a freestanding
structure. Each unit has one or
more bedrooms, a kitchen, a living area,
and at least one bathroom. Before 15
Langsford acquired the units, the freestanding
units received Town approval as
residential single-family dwellings and the
structure containing units one through
nine was approved as a legally nonconforming
residential multiplex dwelling under
the Town's Land Use Ordinance
(LUO).<fnr1> <EM>See</EM> Kennebunkport, Me., Code
&sect;&sect; 240-2.2, -4.10, -7.11 (Nov. 6, 2018). The
units were governed by a Declaration of
Condominium, which required that they be
used for "residential purposes" and prohibited
rentals "for transient or hotel purposes."

<P20>[&para;3] In April 2021, 15 Langsford began
renting the units exclusively for occupancy
for periods of less than thirty consecutive
days. At that time, the Town did not regulate
short-term rentals of residential property.
The units were offered for rent on
the website of 15 Langsford's parent company,
which manages and operates the
units and other resort properties in Kennebunkport.
The parent company's website,
which describes the parent company
as offering "the best inns, resorts, and
hotels in Kennebunkport," acts as a booking
platform for 15 Langsford's units and
the parent company's other properties. In
addition to using a shared platform to book
reservations at the units, short-term rental
guests at the units receive access to amenities
offered by the parent company at its
other properties.

<P20>[&para;4] Also in April 2021, the Town contacted
15 Langsford, stating that it believed
that 15 Langsford was violating the
LUO and the Declaration of Condominium
by using the units for transient rentals.
The Town explained in May 2021 that it
viewed the rentals as "part of a larger
commercial hospitality enterprise" operating
without Planning Board approval required
by the LUO. Without issuing a
formal notice of violation, the Town recommended
that 15 Langsford seek Planning
Board approval pursuant to the LUO for
use of the units as a "commercial lodging
use" and comply with the Declaration of
Condominium prohibition on transient
rentals.

<P20>[&para;5] In response, on June 15, 2021, 15
Langsford amended the Declaration of
Condominium to eliminate the prohibition
on transient rentals and applied for Planning
Board approval for use of the units as
a hotel.

<P20>[&para;6] Also in June 2021, the Town began
regulating short-term rentals through a
licensing ordinance to "require the disclosure
and licensing of short-term rentals
operated within the Town of Kennebunkport,"
<Page 1096>
impose "modest performance standards,"
and limit the number of short-term
rentals in the Town. Kennebunkport, Me.,
Code &sect; 129-1. Under the STRO, "[l]egally
existing residential dwelling units may be
used as short-term rentals upon the issuance
of a short-term rental license," but
certain "lodging establishment uses," including
uses for hotels and inns, are not
eligible for STRO licenses. <EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 129-2(A),
(C). The STRO lacks any provision for
appeals of decisions denying STRO licenses.<fnr2>

<P20>[&para;7] In November 2021, 15 Langsford
contacted the Town's code enforcement officer
(CEO) about obtaining short-term
rental licenses for its units under the
STRO. The CEO reiterated the Town's
position that 15 Langsford was using the
units as a hotel or inn and, therefore, 15
Langsford would not be eligible to receive
short-term rental licenses. Nonetheless, 15
Langsford submitted an application for a
short-term rental license for each of its
eleven units. It also withdrew its application
for Planning Board approval for use of
the units as a hotel.

<P20>[&para;8] On May 12, 2022, the CEO issued
letters denying each of the eleven applications
because the units were not "[l]egally
existing residential dwelling units" eligible
to receive short-term rental licenses. <EM>Id.</EM>
&sect; 129-2(A). The CEO's letters reasoned
that 15 Langsford had operated, advertised,
and managed the units as "a commercial
lodging establishment (e.g., an inn)
under the unified management, control,
and/or ownership of a hospitality business,"
without Planning Board approval,
"in violation of Town ordinances."

<P20>[&para;9] On June 7, 2022, 15 Langsford filed
complaints in the Superior Court pursuant
to Rule 80B and the Uniform Declaratory
Judgments Act, 14 M.R.S. &sect;&sect; 5951-5963
(2024), seeking review of the CEO's denial
of the license applications.<fnr3> The court
(<EM>Douglas, J.</EM>) consolidated the appeals and,
following oral arguments, the court (<EM>Mulhern,
J.</EM>) entered a judgment on June 13,
2023, concluding that the CEO erred as a
matter of law by determining that units
rented by 15 Langsford were not "[l]egally
existing residential dwelling units" within
the meaning of section 129-2 of the STRO.
Citing Rule 80B, the Superior Court vacated
the decision of the CEO denying 15
Langsford's applications for short-term
rental licenses, and the Town timely appealed
to us. <EM>See</EM> M.R. Civ. P. 80B(n); M.R.
App. P. 2B(c)(1).

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<P20>[&para;10] We first explain the basis for the
trial court's jurisdiction to consider the
Town's petition and then review 15 Langsford's
eligibility for the short-term rental
licenses.

<HN02><EMB>A. The Basis for the Superior Court's
Jurisdiction</EMB>

<P20>[&para;11] We begin by identifying and examining
the jurisdictional issues presented by
<Page 1097>
the anomalous absence of a provision in
the STRO that would allow an appeal from
the denial of a license application.

<P20>[&para;12] In Maine, Rule 80B of the
Maine Rules of Civil Procedure is ordinarily
the exclusive procedural vehicle for judicial
review of municipal permitting and
licensing decisions. <EM>Gorham,</EM> 2011 ME 63,
&para; 22, 21 A.3d 115 ("[W]hen direct review is
available pursuant to Rule 80B, it provides
the exclusive process for judicial review
unless it is inadequate."). However, Rule
80B itself does not confer jurisdiction to
review a municipal action; it simply prescribes
the procedure for judicial review
when there is a separate basis for such
jurisdiction. <EM>Lyons v. Bd. of Dirs. of Sch.
Admin. Dist. No. 43,</EM> 503 A.2d 233, 235
(Me. 1986) ("Rule 80B does not create an
independent right to appeal any governmental
action to the Superior Court. It
only provides a procedural avenue for
those disputes in which the court has jurisdiction.").
Rule 80B itself defines the
sources of jurisdiction to review a decision,
stating that it applies when review "is
provided by statute or is otherwise available
by law." M.R. Civ. P. 80B(a). Review
is "otherwise available by law" under Rule
80B(a) "if it is in the nature of that formerly
available under the common law extraordinary
writs, such as certiorari, mandamus
or prohibition, adapted to current
conditions." <EM>Dowey v. Sanford Hous.
Auth.,</EM> 516 A.2d 957, 959-60 (Me. 1986)
(quotation marks omitted); <EM>see</EM> M.R. Civ.
P. 81(c) ("The writs of scire facias, mandamus,
prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto
are abolished. Review of any action
or failure or refusal to act by a governmental
agency, including any department,
board, commission, or officer, shall be in
accordance with procedure prescribed by
Rule 80B.").

<P20>[&para;13] We have not regularly had to examine
the common law writs to consider
jurisdiction over actions governed by Rule
80B because review of decisions made under
municipal ordinances is often available
by statute. For example, if an ordinance
provides for decisions by the municipality's
CEO, planning board, or other decision-maker
to be appealed to the municipal
board of appeals, judicial review of the
board of appeals's decision is available by
statute. 30-A M.R.S. &sect; 2691(1), (3)(G), (4)
(2024). A different statute provides that
"municipal land use decisions" issued pursuant
to land use ordinances are appealable
to the Superior Court pursuant to 30-A
M.R.S. &sect; 4482-A (2024).

<P20>[&para;14] The absence in the STRO of any
procedure allowing appeals to the Town
zoning board of appeals (ZBA) rules out
jurisdiction by virtue of 30-A M.R.S.
&sect; 2691. Jurisdiction under 30-A M.R.S.
&sect; 4482-A is doubtful at best because the
Town has designated a different ordinance
as its land use ordinance (LUO), Kennebunkport,
Me., Code ch. 240, and has elected
to regulate short-term rental licensing
separately under the STRO, <EM>id.</EM> ch. 129.
The Town's LUO does include provisions
for appeals to the ZBA and then to Superior
Court, <EM>id.</EM> &sect;&sect; 240-9.2(A)(1), -9.3(L),
thereby establishing jurisdiction for Rule
80B review by virtue of 30-A M.R.S. &sect; 2691
and 30-A M.R.S. &sect; 4482-A. However, the
Town did not include any provision in the
STRO incorporating the LUO's appeal
process.

<P20>[&para;15] Neither the Superior Court nor
the parties in their briefs to us addressed
the basis for the court's jurisdiction. Nevertheless,
because we cannot confirm statutory
jurisdiction for Rule 80B review, we
must consider whether Rule 80B review of
the CEO's denial is "otherwise available by
law" by virtue of the jurisdiction conferred
by any of the common law writs. <EM>Dowey,</EM>
516 A.2d at 959 ("[I]f a jurisdictional question
exists, we will not hesitate to address
it on our own motion."). After hearing oral
<Page 1098>
argument in this matter, we requested
that the parties submit supplemental briefing
regarding whether, pursuant to M.R.
Civ. P. 80B(a), judicial review of the CEO's
decision "is provided by statute or is otherwise
available by law."

<P20>[&para;16] In response to our request for
supplemental briefing, neither party advanced
a statutory argument for Rule 80B
review. The Town did not address whether
review is "otherwise available by law" and
argued that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction
because there is no statutory
basis for Rule 80B review. 15 Langsford
argued that review pursuant to Rule 80B
is "otherwise available by law" because the
CEO's denial of its applications was an
adjudicatory decision of the kind formerly
subject to judicial review by virtue of the
writ of certiorari.

<HN24><EMB>1. Judicial Review "Otherwise Available
by Law" Before Adoption of
Rule 80B</EMB>

<P20>[&para;17] Until they were abolished by an
amendment to Rule 81 of the Maine Rules
of Civil Procedure in 1967, <EM>see</EM> M.R. Civ. P.
81(c); M.R. Civ. P. 81 Advisory Committee's
Note December 31, 1967, the common
law writs of mandamus, certiorari, and
prohibition enabled judicial review of governmental
action in various contexts. "Prohibition
was issued only under extreme
necessity `to direct any inferior tribunal to
cease abusing its power or usurping judicial
functions that did not rightly belong to
it.'" <EM>Lyons,</EM> 503 A.2d at 236 n.3 (quoting
Field & McKusick, <EM>Maine Civil Practice</EM>
&sect; 81.6 at 617 (1st ed. 1959)). The two writs
under which courts usually reviewed decisions
of governmental officers and agencies
were the writ of certiorari and the
writ of mandamus, with certiorari functioning
as the vehicle for judicial review of
governmental decisions involving a discretionary
and quasi-judicial adjudication of
rights, <EM>Carter v. Wilkins,</EM> 160 Me. 290, 293-94,
203 A.2d 682, 683-84 (1964); <EM>Cunningham
v. Kittery Planning Bd.,</EM> 400 A.2d
1070, 1077 (Me. 1979), and mandamus
functioning to compel the performance of a
ministerial act, <EM>Casco N. Bank, N.A. v. Bd.
of Trustees of Van Buren Hosp. Dist.,</EM> 601
A.2d 1085, 1087 (Me. 1992); <EM>see also Carroll
v. City of Portland,</EM> 1999 ME 131, &para; 9
n.6, 736 A.2d 279 (construing "ministerial"
to mean "of or designating a mandatory
act or duty admitting of no personal judgment
or discretion in its performance" (alteration
and quotation marks omitted)).
We have summarized when mandamus is
and is not available to compel governmental
action:

<B22>When the law requires the public officer
to do a specified act, in a specified way,
upon a conceded state of facts, without
regard to his own judgment as to the
propriety of the act, and with no power
to exercise discretion, the duty is ministerial
in character and performance may
be compelled by mandamus if there is no
other remedy. When, however, the law
requires a judicial determination to be
made, such as the decision of a question
of fact, or the exercise of judgment in
deciding whether the act should be done
or not, the duty is regarded as judicial
and mandamus will not lie to compel
performance.

<P00><EM>Young v. Johnson,</EM> 161 Me. 64, 70, 207
A.2d 392 (1965) (quotation marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;18] Similarly, we have explained the
context in which review by certiorari applies:
"Whether an act is judicial or quasi-judicial
so as to be reviewable by certiorari
depends on the nature of the act performed,
rather than on the character of
the officer or body performing it. Judicial
action is an adjudication on the rights of
the parties who, in general, appear or are
brought before the tribunal by notice or
process, and on whose claims some decision
or judgment is rendered." <EM>Lyons,</EM> 503
A.2d at 236.
<Page 1099>

<HN24><EMB>2. The Common Law Basis for Review
of a Refusal to Perform the
Ministerial Act of Issuing a Permit
or License</EMB>

<P20>[&para;19] Because the nature of the
decision, rather than the identity of the
decision maker, dictated which common
law writ was the vehicle for review, we
next examine the nature of the CEO's
decision to deny 15 Langsford's permit
applications. A CEO's decisions under an
ordinance can be either discretionary or
ministerial, depending on whether the decisions
involve discretionary determinations
of fact or non-discretionary applications
of the ordinance. In situations in
which a CEO has made a discretionary
factual determination in a non-adjudicatory
manner, i.e., without affording notice and
opportunity to be heard or making findings
of fact sufficient to enable judicial
review, we have remanded the matter for
the CEO to convene a proceeding and
render findings of fact. <EM>See Mills v. Town
of Eliot,</EM> 2008 ME 134, &para; 20, 955 A.2d 258;
<EM>29 McKown LLC v. Town of Boothbay
Harbor,</EM> 2022 ME 38, &para; 13, 277 A.3d 364.
In <EM>Mills,</EM> for example, the CEO's issuance
of the disputed building permit required
factual determinations, but the CEO's
"only determination was his decision to
issue the building permit." <EM>Mills,</EM> 2008 ME
134, &para; 18, 955 A.2d 258. We therefore
"remand[ed] the case to the CEO to make
sufficient and clear findings of fact relevant
to the issuance of the building permit
at issue in th[e] case." <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 20.

<P20>[&para;20] The STRO provides, "If the Town
Clerk, or the Town Clerk's designee, in
consultation with" the CEO reviews an
application and "determines that the proposed
short-term rental application complies
with the short-term rental standards,
the Town Clerk shall issue the applicant a
short-term rental license." Kennebunkport,
Me., Code &sect; 129-5(F). Whether a proposed
rental complies with all ordinance standards
might in some cases involve issues of
fact, but here, as the court noted, there
were no disputed issues of fact that required
the CEO to find facts in an adjudicatory
capacity and make a discretionary
determination.<fnr4> The only issue before us&mdash;
whether the units meet the STRO's definition
of "[l]egally existing residential dwelling
units"&mdash;centers solely on the interpretation
of the ordinance, which the court
properly addressed de novo, without deference
to the CEO's interpretation. <EM>Id.</EM>
&sect; 129-2(A); <EM>see, e.g., Tominsky v. Town of
Ogunquit,</EM> 2023 ME 30, &para; 22, 294 A.3d 142.
The purely legal nature of the issue means
that, if the CEO's interpretation of the
STRO was incorrect, the grant of licenses
to 15 Langsford would be a ministerial,
non-discretionary act that 15 Langsford is
entitled to require the CEO to perform.

<P20>[&para;21] "It is well settled that a writ
of mandamus can issue against a public
officer or body to compel performance
when the petitioners have a clear legal
right to the performance of the specific act
sought to be compelled, and the defendants
have a clear legal duty to perform
such act, and the act is ministerial." 5
Patricia E. Salkin, <EM>American Law of Zoning</EM>
&sect; 43:1 (5th ed.), Westlaw (database
<Page 1100>
updated Nov. 2024). Accordingly, before
the advent of Rule 80B, we endorsed the
use of mandamus to compel the ministerial
issuance of a municipal building permit
after it was denied:

<B22>Mandamus is available to the landowner
to compel the administrative officer to
do his duty as required by law. Perhaps
the most frequent group of cases where
mandamus is employed by landowners is
where the building inspector <EM>refuses a
permit which he ought lawfully to grant.</EM>

<P00><EM>Casino Motor Co. v. Needham,</EM> 151 Me.
333, 339-40, 118 A.2d 781, 784 (1955) (emphasis
added and quotation marks omitted).<fnr5>

<P20>[&para;22] For these reasons, we conclude
that direct review of the CEO's denial of
15 Langsford's applications pursuant to
Rule 80B is "otherwise available by law"
by virtue of the common law writ of mandamus,
<EM>see Your Home, Inc. v. City of
Portland,</EM> 505 A.2d 488, 489 (Me. 1986)
("An action pursuant to Rule 80B may lie
where the extraordinary writ of mandamus
was formerly available.").

<HN02><EMB>B. 15 Langsford's Eligibility for Short-Term
Rental Licenses</EMB>

<P20>[&para;23] "The interpretation of a local
ordinance is a question of law, and we
review that determination de novo." <EM>Rudolph
v. Golick,</EM> 2010 ME 106, &para; 8, 8 A.3d
684 (quotation marks omitted). When construing
an ordinance, we will not redefine
terms that the ordinance expressly defines,
<EM>id.</EM> &para; 9, and we will look to the plain,
common meaning of undefined terms "unless
the context clearly indicates otherwise,"
<EM>Jade Realty Corp. v. Town of Eliot,</EM>
2008 ME 80, &para; 9, 946 A.2d 408 (quotation
marks omitted). We construe ordinance
terms "reasonably with regard to both the
objectives sought to be obtained and the
general structure of the ordinance as a
whole." <EM>Id.</EM> (quotation marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;24] The STRO's stated purposes are
"to require the disclosure and licensing of
short-term rentals" in the Town and to
"monitor and track" their proliferation to
avoid unduly burdensome effects on the
Town's neighborhoods. Kennebunkport,
Me., Code &sect; 129-1. Under the ordinance,
"[l]egally existing residential dwelling
units may be used as short-term rentals
<Page 1101>
upon the issuance of a short-term rental
license for the premises in accordance with
the requirements" of the STRO. <EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 129-2(A).
"Short-term rental" under the ordinance
is defined, circularly, as "[t]he use,
control, management or operation of a legally
existing residential dwelling unit offered
for rent for transient occupancy for
dwelling, sleeping or lodging purposes by
short-term rental guests for a tenancy of
less than 30 consecutive days, for compensation,
directly or indirectly, excluding,"
among other establishments, hotels and
inns. <EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 129-3.

<P20>[&para;25] Without a license, short-term rental
of any property is prohibited. <EM>Id.</EM> &sect;&sect; 129-2(B)(1),
-4(A). Additionally, certain "lodging
establishment uses," including uses as
hotels and inns, are exempt from the ordinance
and do not need short-term rental
licenses to operate. <EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 129-2(C).

<P20>[&para;26] The STRO contains a transitional
provision for licensing properties that were
used for short-term rentals before the
Town enacted the ordinance. <EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 129-5(E).
That provision provides, in relevant
part, that "[p]ersons or entities who operated
a legally existing residential dwelling
unit as a short-term rental" prior to the
effective date of the STRO must obtain a
short-term rental license and must demonstrate
that "the premises were previously
used for short-term rental use ... for a
period of less than 30 consecutive days per
tenancy and for at least 14 total days" in
2019, 2020, or 2021.<fnr6> <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>[&para;27] The STRO does not define "legally
existing residential dwelling unit," the
term at the crux of the parties' dispute.

<P20>[&para;28] 15 Langsford contends that
because the units had been approved as
single-family and multiplex residential
dwellings under the LUO when 15 Langsford
began offering them for transient occupancy,
and because a property must
have been used for transient occupancy for
commercial gain prior to enactment of the
STRO in order to be eligible to receive a
short-term rental license, the units were
"legally existing residential dwelling units"
during the time that 15 Langsford offered
them as short-term rentals. In addition, 15
Langsford contends that how a property is
managed or advertised is not relevant to
whether a property is eligible for a short-term
rental license under the STRO.

<P20>[&para;29] The Town argues that 15 Langsford's
units were not "legally existing residential
dwelling units" under the STRO
because when the units were offered for
short-term rental prior to enactment of the
STRO, 15 Langsford was operating as a
hotel or inn in violation of the LUO, and
the units therefore were neither "legally
existing" nor "residential." In support of
this argument, the Town emphasizes that
15 Langsford is owned by an entity that
manages resort properties, that the units
were advertised in concert with those resort
properties, and that guests renting
the units received access to the resort
properties.

<P20>[&para;30] Under the LUO, a hotel is a
"building or group of buildings having 10
or more guest rooms in which lodging or
meals and lodging are offered for compensation."
Kennebunkport, Me., Code &sect; 240-2.2.
Similarly, an inn is a "business establishment
having nine or fewer guest rooms
in which lodging is offered to guests for
compensation."<fnr7> <EM>Id.</EM> We have recognized
that hotels and similar uses under similar
definitions are characterized by transient
<Page 1102>
occupancy, and the Town has, in line with
these definitions, chosen to define hotels
and inns with reference to "guest rooms."
<EM>See Jordan v. City of Ellsworth,</EM> 2003 ME
82, &para; 10, 828 A.2d 768.<fnr8> In contrast, the
STRO defines "dwelling unit" as "[o]ne or
more rooms arranged for complete, independent
housekeeping purposes with space
for living and sleeping; space or facilities
for eating or cooking; and provisions for
sanitation." Kennebunkport, Me., Code
&sect; 129-3.<fnr9>

<P20>[&para;31] Each of 15 Langsford's units contains
a living space, a kitchen, at least one
bedroom, and at least one bathroom. They
are plainly more than "guest rooms" and
are arranged and intended for "complete,
independent housekeeping purposes," i.e.,
residential occupancy. <EM>See, e.g., Town of
Conway v. Kudrick,</EM> 175 N.H. 714, 301
A.3d 823, 829 (2023); <EM>Heef Realty & Invs.,
LLP v. City of Cedarburg Bd. of Appeals,</EM>
361 Wis.2d 185, 861 N.W.2d 797, 801-02
(Wis. Ct. App. 2015); <EM>cf. Morgan v. Townsend,</EM>
2023 ME 62, &para;&para; 21-23, 302 A.3d 30
(recognizing that "the word `residential' in
the context of deed restrictions" generally
does not preclude short-term rentals).<fnr10>
They have never been within the LUO
definitions of "hotel" and "inn" and were
not in violation of the LUO.<fnr11> Instead, they
were legally existing residential single-family
and multiplex dwellings as defined
in the LUO and the STRO, and were used
for short-term rentals during the period
required to qualify for STRO licenses. <EM>See</EM>
Kennebunkport, Me., Code &sect;&sect; 129-3, -5(E),
240-2.2. Because the Town's only reason
for denying 15 Langsford's applications for
short-term rental licenses is that the units
had supposedly been operated as a hotel or
inn in violation of the LUO, 15 Langsford
is entitled to the licenses.

<P20>The entry is:
<Page 1103>

<P20>Judgment affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt1> The multiplex is legally nonconforming because
it contains nine residential dwelling
units despite the LUO's limitation of multiplex
dwellings to eight units. Kennebunkport, Me.,
Code &sect; 240-7.11(A) (Nov. 6, 2018).

<fnt2> The ordinance provides a right of appeal
only from the <EM>suspension or revocation</EM> of a
STRO license. <EM>See</EM> Kennebunkport, Me., Code
&sect; 129-8(D) (current through June 6, 2022).

<fnt3> 15 Langsford's request for declaratory relief
and, in part, its request for Rule 80B relief
focused on alleged constitutional infirmities
regarding the STRO. 15 Langsford's facial
challenges were dismissed, and the Superior
Court concluded that its as-applied challenges
lacked merit. 15 Langsford argues these constitutional
issues only as alternative grounds
to affirm the judgment. Because we affirm the
judgment based on our construction of the
ordinances, we do not reach the constitutional
issues. <EM>See Jackson v. Inhabitants of Town
of Searsport,</EM> 456 A.2d 852, 854 n.10 (Me.
1983) ("A court should avoid expressing opinions
on constitutional law whenever a non-constitutional
resolution of the issues renders
a constitutional ruling unnecessary." (alteration
and quotation marks omitted)).

<fnt4> The STRO requires that applicants pay an
application fee and submit information regarding
the location of the property, contact
information for property owners, and documentation
that the property meets performance
standards involving building safety,
sanitary waste disposal, and parking. Kennebunkport,
Me., Code &sect;&sect; 129-5(A), (B), -6, -7.
The parties do not dispute that 15 Langsford
submitted the required materials and demonstrated
compliance with the STRO performance
standards. There is likewise no disagreement
that the units had been made
commercially available for short-term occupancy
before the STRO's enactment, the
question being whether they were being operated
at the time as a hotel or inn as those
terms are used in the LUO.

<fnt5> Mandamus was historically not available to
compel the performance of an act if the required
act had already been performed. <EM>See
State ex rel. Martin v. Greene,</EM> 156 Ohio St.3d
482, 129 N.E.3d 419, 421 (2019) ("Mandamus
will not lie to compel an act that has already
been performed." (quotation marks omitted));
<EM>State ex rel. Cassel v. Johnston,</EM> 204 Ind. 563,
185 N.E. 278, 279 (1933) ("[A]s the office of
the writ of mandate is to compel action, it will
not issue if the duty sought to be enforced has
already been done."). If the required act is a
discretionary one, "[p]ublic officers can be
directed to act, but not how to act," and once
they have acted, review through mandamus is
no longer available, although review through
certiorari may be. <EM>Rogers v. Brown,</EM> 135 Me.
117, 119, 190 A. 632, 633 (1937). However, if
the required act is "ministerial, then the mandamus
will direct <EM>the specific act</EM> to be performed."
<EM>Id.</EM> (emphasis added). Thus, if the
required ministerial act is the grant of a permit
or license, a denial or refusal of the permit
or license does not render mandamus
unavailable because the required "specific
act" has yet to be performed. <EM>See Casino
Motor Co. v. Needham,</EM> 151 Me. 333, 339-40,
118 A.2d 781, 784 (1955). Here, the act that
15 Langsford seeks to compel the CEO to
perform is not to act on its license applications,
which the CEO has already done, but to
grant the licenses, which the CEO has affirmatively
declined to do. <EM>See Kelly v. Curtis,</EM>
287 A.2d 426, 429 (Me. 1972) (indicating that
mandamus would lie to compel ministerial
action when an action <EM>had been</EM> taken but was
legally incorrect). Because there are no factual
issues requiring a discretionary determination,
the grant of the licenses would be a
ministerial act, assuming 15 Langsford's interpretation
of the STRO is correct. Accordingly,
the CEO's denial of 15 Langsford's application
does not preclude judicial review in
the nature of mandamus.

<fnt6> The record demonstrates, and the parties do
not dispute, that in 2021 15 Langsford rented
each unit for at least fourteen days but for
fewer than thirty consecutive days per tenancy.

<fnt7> At various times throughout 2021, 15
Langsford had between nine and eleven units
available for rent.

<fnt8> In <EM>Jordan v. City of Ellsworth,</EM> we affirmed a
town planning board determination that a
multi-unit property used for a mix of short-term
and long-term tenancy was not a hotel.
2003 ME 82, &para;&para; 3, 13, 828 A.2d 768. Although,
as the Town notes, we recognized in
<EM>Jordan</EM> the nuanced distinction between residential
dwelling units and hotels, that decision,
which focused in part on whether an
occupant's residence was temporary, does not
control the outcome of this appeal. <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 12.
Here, unlike in <EM>Jordan,</EM> the Town has effectively
conferred the right to short-term rental
licenses upon 15 Langsford's units by defining
the terms "hotel" and "inn" in terms of
"guest rooms," Kennebunkport, Me., Code
&sect; 240-2.2, thereby excluding 15 Langsford's
units&mdash;which are not "guest rooms"&mdash;from
those definitions, and by deeming "[l]egally
existing residential dwelling units" such as
Langsford's eligible for licenses under the
STRO, <EM>id.</EM> &sect; 129-2(A).

<fnt9> Although it is the STRO's definition that
determines eligibility for short-term rental licenses,
the LUO has a similar definition of
"dwelling unit" as "[o]ne or more habitable
rooms arranged, designed or intended to be
used, or used[,] as a complete housekeeping
unit ... with independent living, cooking
sleeping, bathing and sanitary facilities." Kennebunkport,
Me., Code &sect; 240-2.2.

<fnt10> The Town relies on <EM>Morgan v. Townsend,</EM>
2023 ME 62, 302 A.3d 30, to distinguish between
residential and commercial use. In that
case, however, we expressly declined to conclude
that short-term rentals are inconsistent
with residential use and instead held that the
use made of the property was impermissible
because a restrictive covenant prohibited
"trade or business" from being conducted on
the property. <EM>Id.</EM> &para;&para; 3, 21-23, 26, 33. In the
instant case, there is no similar blanket prohibition
on the use of residential property for a
commercial purpose; in fact, the STRO requires

<P20>[&para;1] Dylan Ketcham appeals from a
judgment of conviction for the murder of
Jordan Johnson, <EM>see</EM> 17-A M.R.S.
&sect; 201(1)(A) (2024), entered by the trial
court (Kennebec County, <EM>Murphy, J.</EM>) after
a jury found Ketcham guilty. He also
appeals convictions in that same judgment
for attempted murder (Class A), 17-A
M.R.S. &sect;&sect; 152(1)(A), 201(1)(A), 1604(5)(A)
(2024), and elevated aggravated assault
(Class A), 17-A M.R.S. &sect; 208-B(1)(A), (2),
1604(5)(A) (2024), against Caleb Trudeau.
Ketcham argues that the court erred in
limiting the jury's consideration of text
messages and a telephone conversation between
Johnson and Trudeau before the
crimes occurred and in failing to order a
competency evaluation of Ketcham during
the trial. He also challenges the sentence
imposed on him for the three crimes as
resulting from a misapplication of sentencing
principles and constituting an illegal de
facto life sentence. We affirm the judgment
and the sentence.

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<P20>[&para;2] Viewing the evidence in the light
most favorable to the State, the jury could
rationally have found the following facts
beyond a reasonable doubt. <EM>See State v.
Michaud,</EM> 1998 ME 251, &para; 11, 724 A.2d
1222.

<P20>[&para;3] On January 24, 2020, Ketcham and
Johnson exchanged hostile words in a
telephone call and in text messages. Trudeau
&mdash;a friend of both Ketcham and Johnson
&mdash;also exchanged messages with Johnson
about Ketcham. Ketcham and Johnson
agreed to meet near a baseball field in
Gardiner. Trudeau accompanied Johnson
to the arranged meeting, expecting his
two friends to have a fistfight. Neither
Trudeau nor Johnson brought a weapon.
Trudeau hid in nearby trees until he saw
Ketcham pull out a gun and aim it at
Johnson's head. Trudeau emerged in an
effort to stop Ketcham, but Ketcham fired
multiple shots before Trudeau could reach
him. One of the bullets fired from the gun
entered Johnson's brain.

<P20>[&para;4] Trudeau struggled with Ketcham to
get the gun out of Ketcham's hand. The
gun ultimately fell to the ground. Ketcham
moved to take a machete out of his coat.
After trying to prevent Ketcham from unsheathing
the machete, Trudeau fled.
While running away, he tripped and fell in
the road. Ketcham repeatedly struck him
with the machete, resulting in blood loss,
severe lacerations to both arms, the near
severing of one of Trudeau's wrists, and
lacerations to Trudeau's head, neck, and
left shoulder. Trudeau lost consciousness.
After waking, he went to the nearest house
and kicked on the door. After the occupant
opened the door and called 9-1-1, Trudeau
received medical attention from first responders.
Trudeau survived but underwent
treatment for six months at Massachusetts
General Hospital and still has only limited
use of his hands. Johnson died of his injury
several days after being shot.

<P20>[&para;5] On January 27, 2020, the State filed
a complaint charging Ketcham with elevated
aggravated assault of Trudeau. After
Johnson's death, the State filed a complaint
<Page 1107>
on January 29, 2020, charging
Ketcham with Johnson's murder. The
court ordered a mental examination of
Ketcham, which was completed in July
2020, and the court concluded that Ketcham
was competent to stand trial.

<P20>[&para;6] On July 24, 2020, a grand jury
indicted Ketcham on charges of (1) elevated
aggravated assault of Trudeau, (2) attempted
murder of Trudeau, and (3) murder
of Johnson. The court (<EM>Murphy, J.</EM>)
granted the State leave to amend the indictment
to allege Ketcham's use of a firearm,
rather than a knife, in the murder of
Johnson.

<P20>[&para;7] The court began a trial on September
20 and 21, 2022, but declared a mistrial
based on unfair prejudice after the State
played a gory video taken from a police
officer's body camera showing both victims
at the scene of the crime.

<P20>[&para;8] Before a new trial began, the State
moved in limine to limit the admission of
statements in text messages that Johnson
and Trudeau sent to each other about doing
violence to Ketcham. The State argued
that the messages could be admitted only
for limited purposes and not to establish
that either Johnson or Trudeau was violent
on a particular occasion or to justify
Ketcham's use of deadly force, given that
there was no evidence that he was aware
of the communications. Ketcham filed a
motion in limine seeking the admission of
the statements. The court ruled that the
statements exchanged between Johnson
and Trudeau before they met up with
Ketcham were relevant and admissible
only as to the relationship between them
and Ketcham, their common scheme or
plan, and their states of mind.

<P20>[&para;9] At a jury trial held on January 18
and 24-27, 2023, the State offered testimony
from law enforcement officers, Maine
State Police Crime Lab staff, individuals
who heard the argument and gunshots in
the early morning of January 25, a medical
first responder, an emergency room doctor,
the State Medical Examiner, Ketcham's
sister, Ketcham's girlfriend at the
time of the events, and Trudeau. During
Ketcham's cross-examination of Trudeau,
Ketcham elicited testimony about the messages
that Trudeau and Johnson had exchanged
leading up to the confrontation.
Trudeau testified that Johnson had said he
would "smoke" Ketcham and had asked,
"Can we really crack that kid or what?" to
which Trudeau replied, "I'm down." Trudeau
testified that Johnson also quoted at
length a song called "Murder on My
Mind." The State objected that the cross-examination
was disclosing more messages
than the parties had agreed, before trial,
would be shared. The court overruled the
State's objection.

<P20>[&para;10] Cross-examination continued and
included reference to a comment from
Johnson that he would "crack silly dilly
with his own bat," to which Trudeau responded
with laughing emojis. The bat referenced
was "a croquet club or a miniature
bat" that was at Johnson's house. The
State asked for a "moment" and consulted
with Ketcham's counsel about other messages.
The court indicated its intention to
give a limiting instruction because the
messages were not relevant to Ketcham's
self-defense justification unless he knew
about them, and there was no evidence
that he did. That ended the inquiry into
the messages.

<P20>[&para;11] On January 25, Ketcham moved
for a judgment of acquittal at the close of
the State's case, but the court denied his
motion. The court later called attention to
Ketcham's demeanor:

<B42>So off the record the Court expressed
some&mdash;not concern exactly, but just
shared some observations of the defendant's
demeanor throughout the trial.
And what I observed was that he seems
to have a flat affect. He seems to be
<Page 1108>
either medicated or shut down somewhat.
He's not sleeping at the defense
table but he is not reacting to evidence.
I see him communicating with counsel
on occasion.

<B42>So I just wanted to ask if he had been
evaluated or if the defense had any concern
about his competence.

<P00>Ketcham's counsel responded,

<B42>Your Honor, we've had a fair amount
of history with this particular individual
at this point, and he has definitely gone
up and down over the months of our
time with him. I think most recently,
from at least June or so, he has been
pretty clear. In fact there was a time in
August when I think he sort of peaked
in terms of his clarity, for lack of a
better word. And up&mdash;right up until the
eve of trial we really had very little
concern.

<B42>But we share the Court's observations,
we noticed the same things. And
it's caused us a bit of concern throughout
the trial. We've kept an eye on it.
And as the Court has noted, we made a
series of communications with him, I
have made sure he is paying attention
and understands what's happening. And
we certainly brought him in to some of
the decisions that have gone on throughout
the trial. And to my mind throughout
the trial he has been responsive and
appropriate.

<B42>And I think today we had a bit of an
increased concern because of the way&mdash;
there's something about today, he really
sort of seemed a little different. So we&mdash;
we had a very specific and lengthy conversation
with him about that. And
the&mdash;I think the take away is after a
good long discussion, both with him and
after amongst the team, we believe that
he is competent. And we're prepared to
put memos to the file to that effect.

<P00>The court accepted counsel's representations,
and the trial continued.

<P20>[&para;12] The next morning, the parties offered
several stipulations, which the Court
read to the jury. Ketcham again moved for
a judgment of acquittal, and the court
again denied his motion.

<P20>[&para;13] During deliberations, the jury
asked to see copies of the messages exchanged
between Johnson and Trudeau.
Over Ketcham's objection, the court informed
counsel that it was going to advise
the jury that the text messages could not
"be considered on the issue of self-defense"
and "were admitted for a separate
purpose.... Because the defendant was
not aware of those exchanges they cannot
be considered for the issues the jury has to
grapple with, which is whether or not the
defendant acted justifiably in self-defense."
The court explained, "I admitted them for
the limited purpose of showing plan, intent,
motive. But I think the law is still the
law that unless he knows about it, it
doesn't go to the issue of self-defense."
Ketcham argued that the jury could think
the messages were "relevant to some plan,
maybe, or scheme, just as the Court admitted
it for. And I think the Court wrongfully
assumes that they're going to use it
for some improper purpose. And the Court
has already given instructions on all of
this." The court did not alter its decision.

<P20>[&para;14] The jury found Ketcham guilty of
all three charged crimes.

<P20>[&para;15] The court held a sentencing hearing
on May 16, 2023. The State's recommendation
was for a forty-year sentence
for murder and thirty-year sentences for
the other two charges, to run concurrently
with each other and consecutively to the
murder sentence, with all but twenty-five
of the thirty years suspended and four
years of probation. Ketcham argued that
such a sentence would be excessive given
that, although he was an adult, he was a
young man who had made bad decisions.
He sought concurrent twenty-five-year
sentences.
<Page 1109>

<P20>[&para;16] The court considered each count,
beginning with the murder conviction. It
set a basic sentence of forty to forty-five
years based on the premeditated nature of
the act, as evidenced by Ketcham's theft of
a gun, use of a stolen credit card to buy
ammunition, self-fashioned holster for the
machete, and choice of the location to meet
Johnson. It also considered that Ketcham
intentionally attacked two victims on the
same night. The court proceeded to address
the mitigating factors (Ketcham's
youth (age twenty-one), immaturity, and
lack of a criminal record) and aggravating
factors (significant victim impact), treating
Ketcham's mental health as neutral given
that its ordered psychological evaluation
had revealed no identifiable mental illness.
At this second stage of sentencing, the
court found that a forty-five-year sentence
on the murder charge was appropriate.

<P20>[&para;17] The court then proceeded to address
the other charges. It considered
them to comprise one course of conduct for
which the sentences would run concurrently
with each other. As to the basic sentence,
the court determined that the "aggression
and the brutality of this merciless
attack ... is not just disproportionate, it
is, to use an old legal term, it just shocks
the conscience." Because of Ketcham's infliction
of multiple blows, his taunting of
Trudeau while Trudeau was begging for
his life, his abandonment of Trudeau to
die, and the reality that Trudeau survived
only because he found someone to help,
the court concluded that a basic sentence
of thirty years was appropriate. <EM>See</EM> 17-A
M.R.S. &sect; 1604(1)(A) (establishing a thirty-year
maximum sentence for a Class A
crime).

<P20>[&para;18] As mitigating factors, the court
considered Ketcham's young age, crediting
his argument, "to some extent, about what
the social science and the law has finally
come to recognize as the immaturity of
certain young men who live in our community
and the fact that some of them take a
very, very long time to catch up to the rest
of the other young men in the community,
and everyone else, and that they do make
terrible, terrible decisions." The court also
considered, again, Ketcham's lack of a
criminal record. The court considered
Ketcham's mental health as a neutral factor.
As aggravating factors, the court considered
the physical and emotional trauma
that Trudeau experienced and his disfigurement
and loss of physical strength and
dexterity. The court concluded that the
aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating
factors and that a thirty-year sentence
was appropriate.

<P20>[&para;19] Finally, the court determined that
Ketcham presents a threat to public safety
and must have a period of supervision
before living independently in the community.
The court ordered that the sentences
for the crimes committed against Trudeau
run consecutively to the murder sentence
because there was a change in the weapon
used and because the conduct as to each
victim was distinct, particularly given that
Ketcham was attempting to "eliminate"
Trudeau as an eyewitness to the murder of
Johnson.

<P20>[&para;20] Considering the purposes of sentencing
&mdash;particularly concerns for public
safety and the need to avoid diminishing
the gravity of an offense&mdash;the court sentenced
Ketcham to the following terms of
imprisonment:

<B24>&bull; forty-five years for the murder;

<B24>&bull; thirty years, with all but twenty
years suspended, with four years of
probation, for the attempted murder
(consecutive to the sentence for the
murder); and

<B24>&bull; fifteen years for the elevated aggravated
assault (concurrent with the
unsuspended portion of the sentence
for the attempted murder).

<P00>The court also ordered that Ketcham pay
restitution of $1,160.50 for Johnson's memorial
<Page 1110>
monument and $15,150 to the Victims'
Compensation Fund.

<P20>[&para;21] Ketcham timely appealed. <EM>See</EM> 15
M.R.S. &sect; 2115 (2024); M.R. App. P.
2B(b)(1). He filed two notices of appeal,
one designating the date of the jury's verdict
as the date of the judgment appealed
from and the other designating the date of
sentencing as the date of the order appealed
from. He did not file an application to
allow an appeal of the sentence on the
form required by M.R. App. P. 20(a)(2). He
moved for the notice of appeal designating
the date of sentencing to be treated as an
application to the Sentence Review Panel
for leave to appeal his sentence, and we
granted the motion. <EM>See</EM> 15 M.R.S. &sect; 2151
(2024); M.R. App. P. 20. The Sentence
Review Panel granted his application, and
we have considered the sentence appeal
with his appeal from the judgment of conviction.
<EM>See</EM> M.R. App. P. 20(h).

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<HN02><EMB>A. Limitations on Consideration of
Messages Exchanged by the Victims</EMB>

<P20>[&para;22] Ketcham challenges (A) the court's
limitations on how the jury could consider
the text messages exchanged between the
victims and (B) the court's refusal to provide
the jury with a copy of the messages
during deliberations.

<HN24><EMB>1. Limiting Instruction</EMB>

<P20>[&para;23] Ketcham contends that the court
should have allowed the jury to consider
the messages exchanged between the victims
as evidence relevant to Ketcham's
reasonable belief that the use of deadly
force was necessary to defend himself
from imminent deadly force by the victims.
He argues that the jury could infer from
Johnson's messages that Johnson had also
conveyed his violent intentions to Ketcham,
with whom he had argued on the
phone. He reasons that the jury should
have been allowed to infer from that evidence
that Johnson had been the initial
aggressor and that Trudeau was not credible.

<P20>[&para;24] We review for an abuse of
discretion a ruling excluding or admitting
alleged hearsay evidence. <EM>State v. Penley,</EM>
2023 ME 7, &para; 15, 288 A.3d 1183. "Hearsay
&mdash;a statement not made while testifying
at the current trial or hearing that is
offered in evidence to prove the truth of
the matter asserted in the statement&mdash;is
generally inadmissible. <EM>See</EM> M.R. Evid.
801(c), 802. Evidence is admissible notwithstanding
the hearsay rule, however, if
it is `[a] statement of the declarant's then-existing
state of mind (such as motive,
intent, or plan).'" <EM>Penley,</EM> 2023 ME 7, &para; 15,
288 A.3d 1183 (quoting M.R. Evid. 803(3)<fnr1>).
"The state of mind hearsay exception is
limited to evidence that is highly relevant
and uttered in circumstances indicating its
truthfulness above and beyond the reliability
presumed of all statements of present
mental state." <EM>Id.</EM> (alterations and quotation
marks omitted).
<Page 1111>

<P20>[&para;25] When the State offers evidence
of a victim's state of mind in a
murder case, the evidence is generally inadmissible
because both the murder statute
and the statute governing self-defense
are focused on the <EM>defendant's</EM> state of
mind, and because the victim's state of
mind is generally not relevant to any element
of a crime or defense. <EM>See id.</EM> &para;&para; 17-18.

<P20>[&para;26] The considerations are different,
however, when the <EM>defendant</EM> offers the
evidence. There are two purposes for
which a defendant charged with an assault
or other act of physical violence can offer
evidence of threats made by the victim
against the defendant. <EM>See</EM> 17-A M.R.S.
&sect; 108(1), (2) (2024); M.R. Evid. 803(3). One
such purpose is to show, for purposes of
establishing the self-defense justification,
that the victim's prior threats placed the
defendant in reasonable fear that the victim
was about to use deadly force. <EM>See</EM> 17-A
M.R.S. &sect; 108(1), (2)(A)(1). The other
purpose is to show the victim's intent or
plan to carry out the threat. <EM>See</EM> M.R.
Evid. 803(3). We discussed the differences
between the two in <EM>State v. Mitchell</EM>:

<B22>Where self defense is invoked by a defendant,
threats of violence made
against him by the person hurt or killed
by him are generally admissible, <EM>when
known to the defendant before the act,</EM> as
evidence of his apprehension for his own
safety, and the reasonableness of that
apprehension.

<B42>.... It is permissible, however, under
some circumstances, to prove that a person
on whom an assault is alleged to
have been committed had made threats
against the person charged with the assault.
<EM>The issue in such a case is not
whether the respondent knew of them,</EM>
but whether in fact the threats had been
made. The reason for the admission of
evidence of such threats ... is that [a]
threat is a declaration of purpose, and
like other declarations of purpose is evidence
that an occurrence that might be
in execution of that purpose was in fact
in execution thereof.

<P00>144 Me. 320, 323-25, 68 A.2d 387, 388-89
(1949) (emphasis added and quotation
marks omitted).<fnr2>

<P20>[&para;27] Given the evidence in this
case, the court did not abuse its discretion
in informing the jury that the messages
between Johnson and Trudeau did not "go
to the issue of self-defense." There was no
evidence that Ketcham was aware of the
exchanges before he shot Johnson and
maimed Trudeau, so they could not have
caused Ketcham to believe that Johnson or
Trudeau was about to use force or deadly
force against him. Even if Johnson did
convey the threats he discussed with Trudeau
to Ketcham during his argument on
the phone with Ketcham, there is no evidence
that Johnson or Trudeau brought
the bat described in the messages they
exchanged, or any other weapon, with
them when they met Ketcham. Because
the identity of the initial aggressor was not
in issue on this record, there was no abuse
of discretion in the court's limitation on the
purposes for which the jury could consider
the messages.<fnr3>
<Page 1112>

<HN24><EMB>2. Refusal to Supply the Jury with
an Unadmitted Printout of the
Messages</EMB>

<P20>[&para;28] Although Ketcham never offered,
and the court never admitted, a
copy of the messages exchanged between
Johnson and Trudeau, Ketcham argues
that the court should have delivered a copy
to the jury upon the jury's request because
the contents of the messages had been
admitted through testimony for proper
purposes.

<P20>[&para;29] "Whether an <EM>admitted</EM> piece
of evidence accompanies the jury into the
jury room during its deliberations is a
matter within the trial court's discretion."
<EM>State v. Corbin,</EM> 2000 ME 167, &para; 6, 759
A.2d 727 (emphasis added). Here, the
printout of the messages was not authenticated,
offered, or admitted, although some
of the contents were admitted through
Ketcham's cross-examination of Trudeau.
As in <EM>State v. Preston,</EM> 581 A.2d 404, 408
(Me. 1990), where the court refused to
allow a diary to enter the jury deliberation
room when only certain relevant passages
had been read to the jury for impeachment
purposes, the court here did not abuse its
discretion. The court properly withheld
from the jury deliberation room documents
that contained at least some information
that had not been admitted at trial. <EM>See id.</EM>

<HN02><EMB>B. Mid-Trial Question of Competency</EMB>

<P20>[&para;30] Ketcham argues that, despite
his counsel's reassurances to the trial court
that Ketcham understood what was happening
at trial, the court should have ordered
a competency evaluation given the
court's own observation that Ketcham appeared
medicated and exhibited a flat affect.
He argues that the court's failure to
order an evaluation affected his substantial
rights because he thereafter made the decision
whether to testify<fnr4>&mdash;a decision he
could make effectively only if he was competent.

<P20>[&para;31] "The initial responsibility
of raising the question of possible incompetence
to stand trial is on [a defendant's]
counsel, but if the trial court learns from
observation, reasonable claim or credible
source that there is a genuine doubt of the
accused's competency, it becomes the duty
of the trial court to order an inquiry concerning
his competence to stand trial."
<EM>State v. Hewett,</EM> 538 A.2d 268, 269 (Me.
1988) (citation omitted). "A trial court's
decision not to inquire into an accused's
competency is disturbed only for arbitrary
action or abuse of discretion." <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>[&para;32] Here, the court undertook the required
inquiry into Ketcham's competence
to stand trial and did not act arbitrarily or
abuse its discretion by relying on Ketcham's
counsel, who had noticed Ketcham's
"different" demeanor and spoken with
Ketcham to confirm that he understood
the proceedings. Although the court could
have ordered a competency evaluation on
its own initiative, it was not required to do
so, particularly when counsel had indicated
that such a measure was unnecessary. <EM>See</EM>
15 M.R.S. &sect; 101-D(1) (2024) ("The court
<EM>may</EM> for cause shown order that the defendant
<Page 1113>
be examined to evaluate the defendant's
competency to proceed as provided
in this subsection." (emphasis added)).

<HN02><EMB>C. Sentence Appeal</EMB>

<P20>[&para;33] Ketcham argues that the court
misapplied sentencing principles and that,
when viewed in their overall effect, the
sentences offend prevailing notions of decency
and constitute a de facto life sentence
for a person who was only twenty-one
years old at the time of the crime,
amounting to a violation of article I, section
9 of the Maine Constitution.

<HN24><EMB>1. Application of Sentencing Principles</EMB>

<P20>[&para;34] Courts apply a two-step process
for murder sentencing and employ an additional
third step in sentencing for crimes
other than murder. <EM>See</EM> 17-A M.R.S.
&sect; 1602(1), (2) (2024). "First, the court shall
determine a basic term of imprisonment by
considering the particular nature and seriousness
of the offense as committed by the
individual." <EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 1602(1)(A). "Second, the
court shall determine the maximum term
of imprisonment to be imposed by considering
all other relevant sentencing factors,
both aggravating and mitigating, appropriate
to the case," which may include "the
character of the individual, the individual's
criminal history, the effect of the offense
on the victim and the protection of the
public interest." <EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 1602(1)(B). Third, for
convictions of crimes other than murder,
"the court shall determine what portion, if
any, of the maximum term of imprisonment
under paragraph B should be suspended
and, if a suspension order is to be
entered, determine the appropriate period
of probation or administrative release to
accompany that suspension." <EM>Id.</EM>
&sect; 1602(1)(C).

<P20>[&para;35] We review a sentencing
court's determination of the basic sentence
at step one for misapplication of the law or
of sentencing principles, or an abuse of the
court's sentencing power. <EM>See State v.
Williams,</EM> 2020 ME 128, &para; 56, 241 A.3d
835. We review the determination of the
maximum sentence at step two for an
abuse of discretion and the final sentence
reached by the court for a disregard of
sentencing factors or an abuse of the
court's sentencing power. <EM>Id.</EM> We review
whether the court, at "each of the steps of
the sentencing process," has "articulate[d]
which sentencing goals are served by the
sentence." <EM>State v. Watson,</EM> 2024 ME 24,
&para; 22, 319 A.3d 430 (quotation marks omitted).
"Because it can be challenging in a
given case to reconcile potentially disparate
sentencing goals, the trial court is
generally afforded significant leeway in determining
which factors are considered
and the weight a factor is assigned." <EM>Id.</EM>
(quotation marks omitted). Although "a
sentencing court is not required to consider
or discuss every argument or factor the
defendant raises, it must still articulate
which sentencing goals are served by the
sentence and must not disregard significant
and relevant sentencing factors." <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>[&para;36] Although Ketcham disagrees
with the court's weighing of the social-science
research regarding some young
men's brain development, the court explicitly
considered, as mitigating factors,
Ketcham's young age and the current social
science regarding brain development
after age eighteen in some young men.
Similarly, although Ketcham contends that
the court should have afforded him rehabilitative
opportunities, it did do so&mdash;at the
pertinent final stage of sentencing for the
attempted murder count&mdash;by considering
both Ketcham's need for supervision before
living independently in the community
and the importance of having ten additional
years of potential incarceration as a
deterrent to motivate Ketcham to succeed
when he leaves prison. Ketcham does not,
<Page 1114>
in any other respects, challenge the propriety
of the sentence, and there has been no
misapplication of sentencing principles or
abuse of discretion as to any of the crimes
for which Ketcham was convicted.

<HN24><EMB>2. Illegal Imposition of a De Facto
Life Sentence</EMB>

<P20>[&para;37] "The Maine Constitution
requires that `all penalties and punishments
shall be proportioned to the offense.'"
<EM>State v. Stanislaw,</EM> 2013 ME 43,
&para; 28, 65 A.3d 1242 (quoting Me. Const. art.
I, &sect; 9). Maine "conduct[s] a proportionality
review that is broader than the proportionality
review that derives from the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition against cruel and
unusual punishment." <EM>Id.</EM> (citing sources).

<P20>[&para;38] We have adopted a two-part
test for assessing proportionality. <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 29.
First, we "compare the gravity of the offense
with the severity of the sentence."
<EM>Id.</EM> (alteration and quotation marks omitted).
Second, if that comparison creates
"an inference of gross disproportionality,"
we "compare the defendant's sentence with
the sentences received by other offenders
in the same jurisdiction." <EM>Id.</EM> (quotation

<P20>[&para;39] In comparing the gravity of the
offense with the severity of the punishment,
we consider the purposes of sentencing.
<EM>See id.</EM> &para; 30. The trial court considered
the statutory purposes in effect at the time
and concluded that the factors italicized
below were particularly relevant:

<B42><EMBI>1. Prevent crime.</EMBI> <EM>Prevent crime
through the deterrent effect of sentences,
the rehabilitation of persons and the
restraint of individuals when required
in the interest of public safety</EM>;

<B42><EMB>2. Encourage restitution.</EMB> Encourage

Minimize correctional experiences
that serve to promote further
criminality;

through correctional programs.</EMB> Promote
the development of correctional
programs that elicit the cooperation of
convicted individuals;

<B42><EMBI>8. Permit sentences based on factors
of crime committed.</EMBI> <EM>Permit sentences
that do not diminish the gravity of offenses,
with reference to the factors,
among others,</EM> of:

<B44><EMB>A.</EMB> The age of the victim, particularly
of a victim of an advanced age or of a
young age who has a reduced ability
to self-protect or who suffers more
significant harm due to age;

<B44><EMB>B.</EMB> The selection by the person of the
victim or of the property that was
damaged or otherwise affected by the
crime because of the race, color, religion,
sex, ancestry, national origin,
physical or mental disability, sexual
orientation, gender identity or homelessness
of the victim or of the owner
or occupant of that property; and

<B44><EMB>C.</EMB> The discriminatory motive of the
person in making a false public alarm
or report in violation of section 509,
subsection 1; and
<Page 1115>

<B42><EMB>9. Recognize domestic violence and
certified domestic violence intervention
programs.</EMB> Recognize domestic violence
as a serious crime against the
individual and society and to recognize
domestic violence intervention programs
certified pursuant to Title 19-A, section
4116 as the most appropriate and effective
community intervention in cases involving
domestic violence.

<P00>17-A M.R.S. &sect; 1501 (2023) (emphasis added).<fnr5>

<P20>[&para;40] Here, none of the sentences,
taken in isolation, is grossly disproportionate
to the crimes committed. A forty-five-year
sentence for the execution-style
shooting death of a young person over a
seemingly trivial argument is not grossly
disproportionate. Nor is a thirty-year sentence
grossly disproportionate in relation
to the nature of the attempted murder,
which resulted in gruesome, life-threatening,
and permanently debilitating injuries
and was committed with the intent to eliminate
a witness to a murder. As Ketcham
acknowledges, the fifteen-year concurrent
sentence for elevated aggravated assault
did not add to the unsuspended period of
incarceration. Thus, no "inference of gross
disproportionality" may be drawn from
any of the sentences, viewed independently.
<EM>Stanislaw,</EM> 2013 ME 43, &para; 29, 65 A.3d
1242 (quotation marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;41] The length of the combined sentences
results primarily from the imposition
of <EM>consecutive</EM> sentences. Ketcham
does not contend that the court erred in
determining that consecutive sentences
should be imposed, however, and the facts
amply support the court's decision to impose
consecutive sentences. <EM>See</EM> 17-A
M.R.S. &sect; 1608(1)(A) (2024) ("[T]he court
may impose the sentences consecutively
after considering" that "[t]he convictions
are for offenses based on different conduct
or arising from different criminal episodes.");
<EM>State v. Hofland,</EM> 2012 ME 129,
&para;&para; 3, 9, 27, 58 A.3d 1023 (affirming consecutive
sentencing for the defendant's criminal
conduct in a school gymnasium and his
subsequent conduct that day in a school
classroom). In sum, the consecutive sentences
are not grossly disproportionate in
relation to the nature and gravity of the
crimes committed, and the inquiry ends at
this first step of the proportionality analysis.<fnr6>

<P20>The entry is:

<P20>Judgment and sentence affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt1> The pertinent portion of Rule 803 of the
Maine Rules of Evidence provides,

<C5><EMB>RULE 803. EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE
AGAINST HEARSAY&mdash;REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER THE DECLARANT IS AVAILABLE
AS A WITNESS</EMB>

<B22>The following are not excluded by the rule
against hearsay, regardless of whether the
declarant is available as a witness:

<B22>....

<B24><EMB>(3) Then-existing mental, emotional, or
physical condition.</EMB> A statement of the
declarant's then-existing state of mind
(such as motive, intent, or plan) or
emotional, sensory, or physical condition
(such as mental feeling pain, or
bodily health), but not including a
statement of memory or belief to prove
the fact remembered or believed unless
it relates to the validity or terms of
the declarant's will.

<fnt2> Courts in other states have held that evidence
of a victim's animosity or intentions
toward the defendant may be admissible to
show "who started the fight" when the evidence
conflicts on that question, <EM>Massey v.
State,</EM> 272 Ga. 50, 525 S.E.2d 694, 695 (2000);
<EM>Jenkins v. State,</EM> 422 So. 2d 1007, 1008 (Fla.
Dist. Ct. App. 1982), <EM>vacated in part on other

695; <EM>Dixon v. State,</EM> 256 Ga. 658, 352 S.E.2d
572, 574 (1987).

<fnt3> Even were we persuaded that it was an
abuse of discretion to limit the jury's consideration
of the evidence, any error was harmless
given the lack of evidence that either
victim possessed a deadly weapon or otherwise
threatened or exerted deadly force when
they met with Ketcham. M.R.U. Crim. P.
52(a); <EM>see Dixon,</EM> 352 S.E.2d at 574 (affirming
a judgment of conviction when the error in
excluding evidence of the victim's words was
"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt due to
the overwhelming evidence of guilt, including
the evidence that the defendant purchased
and hid the gun shortly before he shot the
victim and the evidence that the victim was a
small woman, was shot from a point higher
than herself, and was highly intoxicated at the
time she was shot by the defendant, and
therefore unlikely to present a physical threat
to him").

<fnt4> Ketcham decided not to testify.

<fnt5> This statute has since been amended,
though not in a way that is relevant to the
sentencing considerations at issue in this appeal.

<fnt6> To the extent that the imposition of a
lengthy sentence upon a young adult for conduct
committed on a single night may seem
contrary to sound public policy&mdash;rather than
as a matter of constitutional law, which must
be our focus&mdash;the Legislature may consider
whether to impose statutory limitations on
such sentences.

<P20>[&para;1] This case involves a dispute between
the Government Oversight Committee
of the 131st Maine Legislature and the
Maine Department of Health and Human
Services over access to confidential Department
records relating to the deaths of
four children in 2021. When the Department
declined to produce the records in
response to a Committee subpoena on the
grounds that child protective files are confidential,
the Committee filed an action in
the Superior Court (Kennebec County)
seeking to compel obedience with its subpoena.
The court (<EM>Stokes, J.</EM>) issued a judgment
denying the Committee's request to
compel, and the Committee appealed. We
affirm the court's judgment.

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<P20>[&para;2] The Department of Health and Human
Services is a cabinet-level agency of
Maine's executive branch. 22-A M.R.S.
&sect;&sect; 201, 204 (2024). Under the Child and
Family Services and Child Protection Act,
22 M.R.S. &sect;&sect; 4001 to 4099-P (2024), the
Department is charged with the duty to

<B22>act to protect abused and neglected children
and children in circumstances that
present a substantial risk of abuse and
neglect, to prevent further abuse and
neglect, to enhance the welfare of these
children and their families and to preserve
family life wherever possible.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 4004(2). By statute, Department records
related to child protective cases are
"confidential and subject to release only
under the conditions [specified in the statute]."
<EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 4008(1).

<P20>[&para;3] The Government Oversight Committee
is a joint legislative committee established
to "oversee program evaluation
and government accountability matters." 3
M.R.S. &sect; 992(1) (2024). The Committee's
duties are set out in 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994 (2024)
(and discussed below). One of its enumerated
duties is to oversee a nonpartisan,
independent legislative office, the Office of
Program Evaluation and Government Accountability
(OPEGA). <EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 994(1)-(4).
OPEGA was created "for the purpose of
providing program evaluation of agencies
and programs of State Government." 3
M.R.S. &sect; 991 (2024).

<P20>[&para;4] In July 2021, after the high-profile
deaths of several young children, the Committee
directed OPEGA to conduct an immediate
review of the child protective services
provided by the Department. The
scope of the review was divided into three
components with staggered reporting
dates. OPEGA issued its first report in
January 2022, focusing on state and federal
oversight of child protective services.
OPEGA issued its second report in March
2022, reviewing child protective services
investigations and examining "how child
safety is protected and the risks to child
safety from the point at which alleged
child abuse or neglect is reported to [the
Department] through the completion of the
investigation."

<P20>[&para;5] Before OPEGA issued its third report
on reunification of families after a
child is removed from a custodian and
planning for children's permanency when
the family cannot be reunified, the Committee
sought to make a separate inquiry
into matters discussed in the previous reports,
specifically a "further inquiry" into
the deaths of the four children who died in
2021. On August 9, 2022, as part of its
"continued oversight of child protective
services," the Committee sent a written
request to the Department asking it to
produce the records pertaining to those
children. The letter "recognize[d] that the
requested records may contain information
<Page 1119>
directly relevant to current and ongoing
criminal proceedings" but stated:

<B22>Given our broad oversight responsibilities,
we are legislative officials to whom
child protective records must be disclosed
pursuant to [22 M.R.S.
&sect; 4008(3)(D)]. Thus, pursuant to our authority
under 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994(11) to directly
receive information, we request
that you provide us with the complete
child protective case files for the [four
children in question].

<P20>[&para;6] The Department, through its Commissioner
at the time, Jeanne Lambrew,
responded in an August 19, 2022, letter
stating that, upon advice of the Office of
the Maine Attorney General, the Department
was unable to share the requested
records directly with the Committee due to
statutory confidentiality restrictions, but
that it would provide the records to OPEGA
as authorized in Title 3. The Committee
served a subpoena to produce documents
on the Department on September
22, 2022, demanding that the records pertaining
to the four children be produced on
or before its October 19, 2022, meeting.
The Department served an objection to the
subpoena, reiterating its position that it
could not legally disclose the records to
the Committee but could, and would, furnish
the requested records to OPEGA.

<P20>[&para;7] On September 26, 2022, OPEGA
made a formal request for the same records
that the Committee had subpoenaed.
OPEGA sent the Department an executed
confidentiality agreement, which required
OPEGA, among other things, to store the
files "on a server that can be accessed only
by OPEGA staff and appropriate staff
from the Legislative Information Services
Department" and maintain working papers
containing confidential information in
locked storage cabinets. The Department
subsequently supplied the files to OPEGA
pursuant to the confidentiality agreement.

<P20>[&para;8] On October 21, 2022, the Committee
filed a complaint in the Superior Court
together with a motion, as required by
statute, seeking to compel obedience with
the subpoena. <EM>See</EM> 3 M.R.S. &sect; 430 (2024).
The Department answered and filed a responsive
pleading. The parties submitted
briefs and waived oral argument. The trial
court concluded that the Committee did
not have statutory authority to access confidential
Department records, denied the
motion to compel, and entered judgment in
favor of the Department.

<P20>[&para;9] The Committee timely appealed.
M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(1).

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<P20>[&para;10] The Committee challenges on two
grounds the trial court's denial of the motion
to compel obedience with its subpoena.<fnr1>
First, the Committee maintains that
the trial court erred in concluding that the
Committee was not authorized by its enabling
statute, 3 M.R.S. &sect;&sect; 991-1002 (2024)
(the OPEGA statute), to receive and review
confidential records and information.
Second, contrary to the trial court's determination,
the Committee argues that the
statutory exception in 22 M.R.S.
&sect; 4008(3)(D) authorizes disclosure of confidential
child protective records.

<P20>[&para;11] We review the trial court's
interpretation of the relevant statutes de
novo. <EM>Ouellette v. Saco River Corridor
Comm'n,</EM> 2022 ME 42, &para; 8, 278 A.3d 1183.
The fundamental objective in interpreting
<Page 1120>
a statute is to determine the Legislature's
intent and to give effect to that intent.
<EM>State v. Hastey,</EM> 2018 ME 147, &para; 23, 196
A.3d 432; <EM>Dickau v. Vt. Mut. Ins. Co.,</EM> 2014
ME 158, &para; 19, 107 A.3d 621; <EM>Pinkham v.
Morrill,</EM> 622 A.2d 90, 95 (Me. 1993). We
begin with the statute's language, giving
due weight to the overall design, structure,
and purpose of the statutory scheme. <EM>See
Dickau,</EM> 2014 ME 158, &para; 22, 107 A.3d 621.
If the language "is clear and unambiguous,
we construe the statute in accordance with
its plain meaning"; if the language is ambiguous,
we then look to other indicia of
legislative intent, including legislative history.
<EM>Adoption by Tamra M.,</EM> 2021 ME 29,
&para; 6, 251 A.3d 311.

<HN02><EMB>A. The OPEGA Statute</EMB>

<HN20><EMB>1. Language, Structure, and Purpose</EMB>

<P20>[&para;12] The OPEGA statute establishes
a mechanism of legislative oversight
of government agencies and programs that
is carried out by OPEGA and generally
overseen by the Committee. Each entity is
prescribed a distinct role, and their respective
roles inform the nature and scope of
access to confidential information and records
such as those at issue here.

<P20>[&para;13] OPEGA "[was] created for the
purpose of providing program evaluation
of agencies and programs of State Government."
3 M.R.S. &sect; 991. "`Program evaluation'
means an examination of any government
program that includes performance
audits, management analysis, inspections,
operations, research or examinations of efficiency,
effectiveness or economy or evaluation
of any tax expenditure required under
[chapter 37 of Title 3]." 3 M.R.S.
&sect; 992(5). Because of the nature and scope
of its charge, OPEGA requires, and is
afforded, full access to agency records,
including confidential information and records.
3 M.R.S. &sect; 997. The OPEGA statute
provides:

<B22><EMB>4. Information available to office.</EMB>
Upon request of the office<fnr2> and consistent
with the conditions and procedures
set forth in this section, <EM>state agencies
or other entities subject to program
evaluation must provide the office access
to information that is privileged or
confidential as defined by Title 1, chapter
13, which governs public records and
proceedings.</EM>

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> (emphasis added).<fnr3> "Privileged or confidential
information obtained by the office
during the course of a program evaluation
<EM>may be disclosed only as provided by law
and with the agreement of the state agency
or other entity subject to the program
evaluation that provided the information.</EM>"<fnr4>
<EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 997(4)(B) (emphasis added).
<Page 1121>

<P20>[&para;14] The Committee's statutorily
defined role is different from OPEGA's,
and so is its specified access to information.
The Committee was established as a
"joint legislative committee" to "oversee
program evaluation and government accountability
matters." <EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 992(1) The
Committee's specific duties are set out in
section 994.<fnr5> Nothing in section 994 authorizes
the Committee to conduct independent
investigations, audits, or program
evaluations directly. That is OPEGA's
function. The Committee directs and
oversees OPEGA's work. Although the
Committee is authorized to conduct hearings
&mdash;and to examine witnesses and to
order the appearance of persons to testify
or produce documents&mdash;the hearings are
expressly "for the purpose of receiving
reports from the office and questioning
public officials about office findings and
recommendations." 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994(4)-(5).

<P20>[&para;15] Consistent with the duties it prescribes,
the OPEGA statute defines&mdash;and
limits&mdash;the information available to the
Committee:

<B22><EMB>11. Information available to committee.</EMB>
To receive certain information. Information
that is made available to the
committee is governed by chapter 21,
which governs legislative investigating
committees, and by Title 1, chapter 13,
which governs public records and proceedings.

<P00>3 M.R.S. &sect; 994(11). Thus, the Committee
may "receive <EM>certain</EM> information" that
falls into one of two categories. <EM>Id.</EM> (emphasis
added).

<P20>[&para;16] First, the Committee may "receive"
information that is governed by Title
1, chapter 13. Title 1, chapter 13 is the
Maine Freedom of Access Act, 1 M.R.S.
&sect;&sect; 400-414 (2024), which, among other
things, defines "public records," that is,
records that are accessible to the public.
<EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 402(3). "Public records" excludes
"[r]ecords that have been designated confidential
by statute" and "[r]ecords that
would be within the scope of a privilege
against discovery or use as evidence recognized
by the courts of this State." <EM>Id.</EM>
&sect; 402(3)(A)-(B). This signifies a clear intention
to authorize the Committee to access
only public information or records&mdash;that is,
information or records available to the
public either directly or through public
<Page 1122>
proceedings&mdash;and not privileged or confidential
information or records.<fnr6>

<P20>[&para;17] Second, the Committee may receive
information "governed by chapter
21" of Title 3.<fnr7> 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994(11). Chapter
21 establishes the rules and procedures
applicable to "legislative investigating committees,"
including, as relevant here, rules
regarding the issuance of subpoenas. <EM>See</EM> 3
M.R.S. &sect;&sect; 411, 423 (2024). A key provision
in chapter 21 is section 412, which provides:
"The authorization creating an investigating
committee shall clearly state,
<EM>and thereby limit,</EM> the subject matter and
scope of the study or investigation. <EM>No
investigating committee shall exceed the
limits set forth in such authorization.</EM>" 3
M.R.S. &sect; 412 (2024) (emphasis added).

<P20>[&para;18] Thus, this imposes another
limitation on the nature of the information
and records that the Committee may receive,
either directly or via subpoena: it
may receive only information and records
that are relevant to, and within the scope
of, the Committee's duties, authority, and
purpose. This is consistent with the general
principle that a legislative committee's
authority to subpoena records is co-extensive
with, and cannot exceed, the proper
scope of the committee's legislatively prescribed
duties. <EM>See Me. Sugar Indus., Inc.
v. Me. Indus. Bldg. Auth.,</EM> 264 A.2d 1, 7
(Me. 1970) (stating that "it is to be presumed
that the Legislature is concerned
only with matters within the proper scope
of investigation"); <EM>cf. Trump v. Mazars
USA, LLP,</EM> 591 U.S. 848, 862-63, 140 S.Ct.
2019, 207 L.Ed.2d 951 (2020) ("Most importantly,
a congressional subpoena is valid
only if it is related to, and in furtherance
of, a legitimate task of the Congress."
(quotation marks omitted)). A subpoena
must serve a "valid legislative purpose."
<EM>Quinn v. United States,</EM> 349 U.S. 155, 161,
75 S.Ct. 668, 99 L.Ed. 964 (1955).

<P20>[&para;19] The OPEGA statute's plain language,
structure, and purpose creates a
clear division of roles between OPEGA
and the Committee; their respective access
to agency records and information
follows from that division of roles. Notwithstanding
the Committee's authority to
subpoena witnesses and records, section
994(11) appears to prohibit it from accessing
confidential information generally. To
the extent this remains ambiguous, the
<Page 1123>
legislative history of the OPEGA statute
confirms this conclusion.

<HN20><EMB>2. Legislative History</EMB>

<P20>[&para;20] In 2002, a bill, L.D. 2193 (120th
Legis. 2002), was introduced to establish a
mechanism to evaluate and audit state
agencies and programs. As originally proposed,
the bill established both OPEGA
and the Committee but purported to give
the Committee itself direct involvement in
program evaluations and reviews. <EM>See id.</EM>
at 1 ("The Joint Legislative Oversight
Committee ... is created for the purpose
of providing program evaluation of agencies
and programs of State government.").

<P20>[&para;21] L.D. 2193 was controversial. Numerous
concerns were raised, including
fears about the potential for partisan
abuse, worries about unfettered access to
privileged or confidential data, and a perception
that the public may lack confidence
in a process that could be viewed as overly
political. <EM>See</EM> 3 Legis. Rec. S-1923 to S-1924,
S-1992 to S-2000 (2d Reg. Sess.
2002). In response, the bill was amended
twice and was the subject of several floor
debates, during which proponents sought
to alleviate the concerns. <EM>Id.</EM>; Comm.
Amend A to L.D. 2193, No. H-1039 (120th
Legis. 2009); Sen. Amend. C to Comm.
Amend. A to L.D. 2193, No. S-595 (120th
Legis. 2009).

<P20>[&para;22] For example, one of the proponents,
Senator Pendleton, assured the Senate
that in one of the amendments, "[W]e
wanted an oversight committee but we also
wanted an office with a purpose, to serve
as an information gathering office for the
entire legislature." 3 Legis. Rec. S-1993
(2d Reg. Sess. 2002). Senator Pendleton
added, "We thought that in order for this
office to function efficiently, it needs to be
as far away from the perception of any
kind of partisan politics to the public and
also to those bureaus, programs, or entities
that were being examined." <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>[&para;23] Another proponent, Senator
Youngblood, said:

<B22>No committee person, no legislator,
would be involved based on this present
legislation. They would never be involved
in doing that research. No legislator
would be involved in doing that
research. Elected officials oversee this
function.... There are all those safeguards
in it.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at S-1998. Later, he again emphasized:

<B22>No legislator has the ability to go out
and get involved in any research. <EM>No
legislator has the ability to review the
data that is being researched and influence
the report prior to the report being
given back to the committee. The committee
then has the ability and the statutory
authorization to accept the report,
to deny the report, or to accept it in part</EM>
.... The day that this report is made
available to that committee it is made
available to each and every one of us
and the general public. That's the only
way that you have the total perception
by the consuming public, by the people
who sent us here, that this is a non-biased,
believable[] report.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at S-1999 (emphasis added).

<P20>[&para;24] Responding to a specific concern
raised about the confidentiality of records
and data, Senator Youngblood acknowledged
that confidentiality was a "big concern"
but assured his colleagues that the
bill was written with specific provisions
pertaining to the confidentiality of records
and working papers of OPEGA. <EM>Id.</EM> at S-1998
to S-1999.

<P20>[&para;25] The legislation enacted later that
session, as amended, did not include the
originally proposed provisions authorizing
the Committee to have direct involvement
in program evaluations;<fnr8> established essentially
<Page 1124>
the same oversight functions and
duties for the Committee that are currently
reflected in 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994(1)-(10); and
included a provision substantively identical
to the current section 997(4), giving OPEGA
access to privileged and confidential
information held by governmental entities:

<B22><EMB>4. Information available to the office.</EMB>
Notwithstanding any other law relating
to the confidentiality of information, all
information in the files of a state agency
or other entity subject to program evaluation
by the office under this chapter
must be made available when necessary
to the office for performance of its
duties.

<P00>P.L. 2001, ch. 702, &sect; 2 (effective July 25,
2002).

<P20>[&para;26] Nonetheless, concerns persisted
about giving even OPEGA unfettered access
to agency-held confidential information
and records. The following year, the
Legislature amended section 997(4) to remove
OPEGA's authority to access confidential
information in the possession of
state agencies without consent and instead
restricted OPEGA to information and records
publicly available under FOAA:

<B22><EMB>4. Information available to the office.</EMB>
<EMS>Notwithstanding any other law relating
to the confidentiality of information, all
information in the files of a state agency
or other entity subject to program evaluation
by the office under this chapter
must be made available when necessary
to the office for performance of its
duties</EMS>. <EMU>Information that is made available
to the office is governed by chapter
21, which governs legislative investigating
committees, and by Title 1, chapter
13, which governs public records and
proceedings.</EMU>

<P00>P.L. 2003, ch. 451, &sect; KKK-4 (emergency,
effective June 12, 2003); <EM>see also</EM> 3 M.R.S.
&sect; 997(4)(C).

<P20>[&para;27] Because this change was controversial,
another provision was enacted at
the same time requiring that the Committee
review and determine the kind of confidential
information required "to fulfill the
purposes set forth in [the OPEGA statute]"
and then to "report its findings and
recommendations, together with any necessary
proposed implementing legislation,
to the Second Regular Session of the 121st
Legislature." P.L. 2003, ch. 451, &sect; KKK-5
(emergency, effective June 12, 2003).

<P20>[&para;28] The Committee apparently followed
up on this charge. In 2004, the
Legislature amended section 997(4) to restore
OPEGA's access to agency-held confidential
records. P.L. 2003, ch. 673,
&sect; GGGG-9 (effective July 30, 2004). The
amendment was paired with the addition
of a new provision&mdash;section 994(11)&mdash;limiting
the Committee's access to confidential
information. P.L. 2003, ch. 673, &sect; GGGG-7
(effective July 30, 2004). The newly added
section 994(11) restricted the information
that could be received by or made available
to the Committee to information
"governed by chapter 21, which governs
legislative investigating committees, and
by Title 1, chapter 13, which governs public
records and proceedings." The same
language that had been used to remove
OPEGA's ability to access confidential records
was used to define (and limit) the information
accessible by the Committee.
<EM>Compare</EM> P.L. 2003, ch. 451, &sect;&sect; KKK-4
(emergency, effective June 12, 2003), <EM>with</EM>
P.L. 2003, ch. 673, &sect; GGGG-7 (effective
July 30, 2004).

<P20>[&para;29] In an April 2004 floor address,
Senator Youngblood stressed the importance
<Page 1125>
of the amendment restoring OPEGA's
access to confidential records while
simultaneously restricting access to all legislators:
"It clarifies an area of confidentiality.
I've said before in this chamber and
I'll say it again, <EM>this committee, this legislature,
with these changes in that particular
piece of statute, does not give any of us
any ability to get at confidential information.</EM>"
3 Legis Rec. S-1665 (2d Spec. Sess.
2004) (emphasis added).

<P20>[&para;30] Section 994(11) has remained unchanged
since its enactment in 2004. This
is especially significant in light of two additional
considerations.

<P20>[&para;31] First, the following year, in 2005, a
controversy arose like the one at issue
here. The Committee sought direct access
to the Department's confidential child protective
records. <EM>See</EM> Op. Me. Att'y Gen.
2005-06. Then Attorney General G. Steven
Rowe issued an advisory opinion in which
he opined that the OPEGA statute set out
"different standards applicable to the
Committee, as distinguished from those
applicable to the OPEGA staff," and, citing
section 994(11), concluded that "records
that are confidential under [Title 1, chapter
13] are not available to the Committee."
<EM>Id.</EM> at 3. Though the opinion of the
Attorney General was not binding, it put
the Committee on notice of the very issue
raised in this appeal. Yet, in the twenty
intervening years, the Legislature has taken
no action to amend or clarify section
994(11)&mdash;at least until recently.

<P20>[&para;32] Second, in the First Regular Session
and First Special Session of the 131st
Legislature, three bills were introduced to
expand section 994(11) to expressly authorize
the Committee to access confidential
information. <EM>See</EM> L.D. 1195 (131st Legis.
2023); L.D. 1275 (131st Legis. 2023);
L.D. 1725 (131st Legis. 2023). L.D. 1195
proposed to amend section 994(11) to authorize
the Committee "[t]o receive papers
or records received as a result of a subpoena"
and to designate those papers or records
as confidential. L.D. 1275 proposed to
amend section 994(11) to specifically authorize
the Committee "[t]o receive documents
from the Department of Health and
Human Services relating to an investigation
of the death of a child with previous
department involvement" and to designate
such documents as confidential. And L.D.
1725 proposed to amend section 994(11) to
expressly authorize the Committee to receive
"information and records, including
information and records that are otherwise
privileged or confidential." None of these
bills was enacted.

<HN02><EMB>B. Exception under 22 M.R.S.
&sect; 4008(3)(D)</EMB>

<P20>[&para;33] Section 4008(1) of Title 22
provides:

<B22><EMB>1. Confidentiality of records and information.</EMB>
All department records that
contain personally identifying information
and are created or obtained in connection
with the department's child protective
activities and activities related to
a child while in the care or custody of
the department, and all information contained
in those records, are confidential
and subject to release only under the
conditions of subsections 2 and 3.

<P00>The Committee acknowledges that the records
it subpoenaed fall within, and are
protected by, section 4008(1). It contends,
however, that a provision in section
4008(3)(D) is an exception to the general
rule of confidentiality that mandates disclosure
here. Section 4008(3)(D) provides:

<B22><EMB>3. Mandatory disclosure of records.</EMB>
The department shall disclose relevant
information in the records to the following
persons:

<B22>....

<B22><EMB>D.</EMB> An appropriate state executive or
legislative official with responsibility for
child protection services, provided that
<Page 1126>
no personally identifying information
may be made available unless necessary
to that official's functions.

<P00>The Committee argues that its members
are "legislative officials with responsibility
for child protection services." We find this
argument unpersuasive.

<P20>[&para;34] Under a plain reading of section
4008(3)(D), the Committee itself would not
be considered a "legislative official." Nor
does the Committee have "responsibility
for child protection services." Its duties
are set out in section 992, as discussed
above. Strictly speaking, individual Committee
members are elected legislators,
not "legislative officials." And even if they
could be considered "legislative officials,"
individual Committee members do not
have "responsibility for child protection
services" in their capacity as members of
the Committee. The Committee's general
oversight responsibility to ensure that
state programs are being properly administered
is fundamentally different than
having specific "responsibility for child
protection services." <EM>Id.</EM> The Committee's
function is "to oversee program evaluation
and government accountability matters," 3
M.R.S. &sect; 992(1), and to direct OPEGA, <EM>id.</EM>
&sect; 994(3)&mdash;not to exercise responsibility for
child protection services.

<P20>[&para;35] Even if section 4008(3)(D)
were ambiguous, it is not sufficiently clear
that the Committee's reading is supportable.
When a statute's language is ambiguous,
we "consider the statute's meaning in
light of its legislative history and other
indicia of legislative intent." <EM>Hastey,</EM> 2018
ME 147, &para; 23, 196 A.3d 432. Section
4008(3)(D) was enacted in 1980, P.L. 1979,
ch. 733, &sect; 18 (effective July 3, 1980), well
before the OPEGA statute was enacted.
Clearly, at the time it was enacted, section
4008(3)(D) was not intended to apply specifically
to this Committee or its members.
Moreover, when viewed against the backdrop
of the Committee's function and the
limitations imposed on information that
may be "received" by the Committee, we
cannot conclude that it is properly read
now to mandate Committee access to confidential
child protective files.

<P20>[&para;36] Thus, taking into consideration its
plain language and history as well as the
context of the statutory framework as a
whole, we conclude that the exception in
section 4008(3)(D) does not operate to
mandate disclosure to the Committee of
the records at issue here.<fnr9>

<HN02><EMB>C. Inherent Authority under</EMB> <EMBI>Maine
Sugar</EMBI>

<P20>[&para;37] The Committee, citing our decision
in <EM>Maine Sugar Industries, Inc. v. Maine
Industrial Building Authority,</EM> 264 A.2d 1
(Me. 1970), raises for the first time on
appeal the argument that it has inherent
<Page 1127>
power to compel the Department to disclose
confidential information via subpoena.
The Department objects to our consideration
of this issue because it has not
been preserved.

<P20>[&para;38] Generally, we do not entertain
issues on appeal that have not been
raised before the trial court. <EM>See Warren
Const. Grp., LLC v. Reis,</EM> 2016 ME 11, &para; 9,
130 A.3d 969 (reaffirming that "unless a
fundamental liberty interest is at stake, we
will not reach an issue that is raised for
the first time on appeal"); Alexander,
<EM>Maine Appellate Practice</EM> &sect; 403(a) at 240
(6th ed. 2022); <EM>see also Teel v. Colson,</EM> 396
A.2d 529, 534 (Me. 1979) ("It is a well
settled universal rule of appellate procedure
that a case will not be reviewed by an
appellate court on a theory different from
that on which it was tried in the court
below.").

<P20>[&para;39] The Committee acknowledges
that this issue is unpreserved but
contends that we have discretion in an
"appropriate situation," <EM>Scott v. Lipman &
Katz, P.A.,</EM> 648 A.2d 969, 974 (Me. 1994),
and urges us to entertain the issue, citing
<EM>Truman v. Browne,</EM> 2001 ME 182, &para; 12,
788 A.2d 168 (holding that we may consider
an unpreserved issue if "it is purely
legal, its resolution does not require the
introduction of additional facts, its proper
resolution is clear, and a failure to consider
it may result in a miscarriage of justice").
Here, the issue is purely a legal one; it
requires no factual development beyond
the existing record; and its resolution
seems clear. In addition, this matter involves
a dispute between two branches of
government, and "when institutional interests
are at stake, the case for the favorable
exercise of a court's discretion is strengthened,
and waiver rules ought not to be
applied inflexibly." <EM>Nat'l Ass'n of Soc.
Workers v. Harwood,</EM> 69 F.3d 622, 628 (1st
Cir. 1995). We therefore consider the issue.

<P20>[&para;40] In <EM>Maine Sugar,</EM> the issue presented
to us was whether an ad hoc, "special
interim legislative committee" with subpoena
power was authorized to access documents
that were protected by a general
confidentiality statute. 264 A.2d at 2-4.
This special interim legislative committee
was formed for the sole purpose of investigating
a crisis that concerned the insuring
of industrial loans and threatened the stability
of the northern Maine economy. <EM>Id.</EM>
We concluded that the confidentiality statute
in that case<fnr10> "must be construed as
prohibiting voluntary disclosure ... but
not as prohibiting mandatory disclosure
... when required by the [special interim
legislative committee]." <EM>Id.</EM> at 6.

<P20>[&para;41] The Committee reads <EM>Maine Sugar</EM>
as holding that legislative investigating
committees have inherent authority to access
confidential information unless there
is an explicit statutory prohibition against
such access. The Committee argues that,
like the confidentiality statute at issue in
<EM>Maine Sugar,</EM> 22 M.R.S. &sect; 4008 does not
explicitly bar disclosure of the Department's
confidential records via legislative
subpoena, and, therefore, the Committee
retains its inherent authority to access the
records.

<P20>[&para;42] <EM>Maine Sugar</EM> does not support the
Committee's position. In that case, we
<Page 1128>
"presumed" that the special interim legislative
committee in <EM>Maine Sugar</EM> was
"concerned only with matters within the
proper scope of investigation," but that is
not so here. 264 A.2d at 7. As we discussed
above, the Committee's duties do not include
conducting program evaluations or
overseeing child protective services. Reviewing
child protective records is therefore
not within the scope of the Committee's
duties. Moreover, the issue in <EM>Maine
Sugar</EM> was the effect of a general confidentiality
statute on the special interim legislative
committee's access to confidential
information; there was no statute specifically
limiting the committee's access. Here,
not only are child protective records confidential
by a statute of general applicability,
22 M.R.S. &sect; 4008, but the Committee is
specifically prohibited by its enabling legislation
from receiving privileged or confidential
records or information, 3 M.R.S.
&sect; 994(11).

<P20>[&para;43] While the appeal in <EM>Maine
Sugar</EM> was pending, the Legislature
amended the statute at issue, 10 M.R.S.A.
&sect; 852 (Supp. 1970), to make clear its intention
that the special interim legislative
committee have access to the confidential
information the committee was seeking.
264 A.2d at 4; <EM>see</EM> P.L. 1969, ch. 584, &sect; 1
(effective May 9, 1970) ("Nothing in [section
852] shall be construed to prohibit the
disclosure of information from records or
files of the authority or the production of
records or files of the authority to a special
interim legislative investigating committee,
or its agent, upon written demand from
the chairman of the committee or any
member of the committee designated by
him."). Here, as noted above, the Legislature
considered clarifying the Committee's
authority to allow it to receive confidential
child protective records but did not do so.

<P20>[&para;44] In <EM>Maine Sugar,</EM> we deemed access
to the records to be necessary for
the special interim legislative committee
to do its work because "`[a] legislative
body cannot legislate wisely or effectively
in the absence of information respecting
the conditions which the legislation is intended
to affect or change.'" 264 A.2d at
6 (quoting <EM>McGrain v. Daugherty,</EM> 273
U.S. 135, 175, 47 S.Ct. 319, 71 L.Ed. 580
(1927)). Here, the OPEGA statute contemplates
that the Committee (and, simultaneously,
the Legislature) is "fully informed"
when it receives a report from
OPEGA.<fnr11> <EM>Id.</EM> Although the Committee
may seek supplemental information in
connection with a report, the "legislative
body," i.e., the Legislature, has chosen to
limit the scope of information that it may
"receive." <EM>Id.</EM> (quoting <EM>McGrain,</EM> 273 U.S.
at 175, 47 S.Ct. 319). Thus, the "legislative
body" is not precluded from "legislat[ing]
wisely or effectively in the absence of information
respecting the conditions which
the legislation is intended to affect or
change." <EM>Id.</EM> (quoting <EM>McGrain,</EM> 273 U.S.
at 175, 47 S.Ct. 319).

<P20>[&para;45] In short, unlike the circumstances
in <EM>Maine Sugar,</EM> the Committee's authority
to access confidential child protective
records is limited by the scope of its statutorily
prescribed duties and by the class of
information that it may receive.

<CN><EMB>III. CONCLUSION</EMB>

<P20>[&para;46] The Legislature controls the authority
and functioning of its own committees.
For the reasons set out above, we
conclude that the Legislature has determined
the role of the Committee in the
scheme of governmental oversight and review
as well as the information available to
it in that process. It is free to clarify or
change the Committee's role, the scope of
its authority, and the nature of the information
<Page 1129>
believed necessary for the Committee
to carry out its work.

<P20>The entry is:

<P20>Judgment affirmed.
[CJ]
<P20><author>LAWRENCE</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>, concurring.
[CT]
<P20>[&para;47] I agree with the Court's determination
that the Committee was not entitled
to the confidential records at the time of
its subpoena. Where I part ways with the
Court's opinion is that it goes too far in
concluding that the Committee is never
authorized to seek and, if necessary, demand
the production of confidential information
like the Department's child protective
records.

<P20>[&para;48] "The fundamental objective in interpreting
statutes is to determine the intent
of the Legislature in enacting them
and to give effect to that intent." <EM>Pinkham
v. Morrill,</EM> 622 A.2d 90, 95 (Me. 1993). We
interpret a statute's language "to avoid
absurd, illogical, or inconsistent results
and attempt[] to give all of its words
meaning." <EM>Jackson Lumber & Millwork
Co., Inc. v. Rockwell Homes, LLC,</EM> 2022
ME 4, &para; 10, 266 A.3d 288. As a general
rule, words and phrases that are not expressly
defined in a statute "must be given
their plain and natural meaning and should
be construed according to their natural
import in common and approved usage."
<EM>Goodine v. State,</EM> 468 A.2d 1002, 1004 (Me.
1983); <EM>see also</EM> 1 M.R.S. &sect; 72(3) (2024)
("Words and phrases shall be construed
according to the common meaning of the
language.").

<P20>[&para;49] This Court looks to dictionary definitions
to help determine the ordinary
meaning of words in a statute. <EM>See, e.g.,
Searle v. Town of Bucksport,</EM> 2010 ME 89,
&para;&para; 8-10, 3 A.3d 390. In looking for the plain
meaning, we view "the relevant provisions
in the context of the entire statutory
scheme to generate a harmonious result."
<EM>Corinth Pellets, LLC v. Arch Specialty
Ins. Co.,</EM> 2021 ME 10, &para; 19, 246 A.3d 586
(quotation marks omitted). This Court
"<EM>should not read a statute to conflict with
another statute when an alternative, reasonable
interpretation yields harmony.</EM>"
<EM>Pinkham,</EM> 622 A.2d at 95 (emphasis added).

<P20>[&para;50] If a statute is unambiguous, "we
interpret the statute directly <EM>without examining
legislative history.</EM> We look to
legislative history and other extraneous
aids in interpretation of a statute <EM>only
when we have determined that the statute
is ambiguous,</EM>" meaning that it "is reasonably
susceptible to different interpretations."
<EM>Thurston v. Galvin,</EM> 2014 ME 76,
&para; 13, 94 A.3d 16 (emphasis added) (quotation
marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;51] As the Court's opinion states,
OPEGA was created "for the purpose of
providing program evaluation of agencies
and programs of State Government." 3
M.R.S. &sect; 991 (2024). Because of the nature
and scope of its charge, OPEGA requires,
and is afforded, full access to agency records,
including confidential information. 3
M.R.S. &sect; 997(4) (2024).

<P20>[&para;52] The Committee was established as
a "joint legislative committee" to "oversee
program evaluation and government accountability
<EM>matters.</EM>"<fnr12> 3 M.R.S. &sect; 992(1)
(2024) (emphasis added). The Committee
directs and oversees OPEGA's work pursuant
to the provisions of the Committee's
enabling statute, 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994 (2024).<fnr13>
<Page 1130>
Black's Law Dictionary defines "matter"
as "[a] subject under consideration." <EM>Matter,</EM>
Black's Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024).
Here, the subject under consideration is
the deaths of four children who received
child protective services from the Department.
Therefore, the Committee's role is
to oversee OPEGA's investigation into the
deaths of these four children.

<P20>[&para;53] The Committee is not authorized
to conduct independent investigations, audits,
or program evaluations directly. However,
given the plain language and context
of the statutory scheme, this lack of authorization
does not preclude the Committee
from accessing confidential information
pursuant to its statutory duties set out in
section 994.

<P20>[&para;54] Section 994 provides that the information
available to the Committee is governed
by (a) the Rules for Legislative Investigations,
Title 3, chapter 21, and (b)
the Freedom of Access Act (FOAA), Title
1, chapter 13. 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994(11). The
Rules for Legislative Investigations expressly
provide for a legislative committee
to be granted the power to "issue subpoenas
... in connection <EM>with any study or
investigation,</EM>" <EM>see</EM> 3 M.R.S. &sect; 411 (2024)
(emphasis added),<fnr14> for a committee granted
subpoena power to be deemed an "investigating
committee," 3 M.R.S. &sect; 402(4)
(2024), and for an investigating committee
to utilize an "executive session" to exclude
the public from that session and the discussion
of confidential matters, <EM>id.</EM>
&sect; 402(2). As a legislative committee granted
subpoena power, the Committee thus
has the power to hold executive sessions to
discuss confidential matters.

<P20>[&para;55] FOAA governs the information
available to the Committee via its subpoena
<Page 1131>
power. 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994(11). FOAA sets
forth that it is the intent of the Legislature
that its actions be taken openly, and that
the records related to those public proceedings
be open to public inspection. 1
M.R.S. &sect; 401 (2024). But FOAA also makes
clear that executive sessions are permitted
in order to allow for private "[d]iscussions
of information contained in records made,
maintained or received by a body or agency
when access by the general public to
those records is prohibited by statute." 1
M.R.S. &sect;&sect; 401, 405(6)(F) (2024). FOAA also
defines <EM>both</EM> "public records," 1 M.R.S.
&sect; 402(3) (2024), <EM>and</EM> "confidential and privileged
records," 1 M.R.S. &sect; 402(3)(A), (B),
demonstrating that "records" may refer to
both public and confidential records. Thus,
it is clear that the Committee may exercise
its subpoena power with respect to both
public and confidential information. Therefore,
contrary to the contention in the
Court's opinion, the plain language of
FOAA does not expressly preclude the
Committee from accessing confidential information,<fnr15>
and the Rules for Legislative
Investigations specifically contemplate this
possibility by allowing for executive sessions
to discuss confidential matters.

<P20>[&para;56] In performing its duties relative to
receipt of OPEGA's reports, the Committee
has the authority to conduct hearings.
3 M.R.S. &sect; 994(4)-(8). With respect to those
hearings, the Committee may seek information
and the production of "papers or
records, including books, accounts, documents,
computer disks or memory or other
electronic media and other materials regardless
of their physical or electronic
form," 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994(5), and nothing in
this portion of the enabling statute expressly
precludes the Committee's pursuit
of confidential information. Moreover, if
information sought by the Committee is
not provided, the Committee may issue a
subpoena for the production of that information.<fnr16>
3 M.R.S. &sect; 165(7) (2024); 3
M.R.S. &sect; 423 (2024); 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994(8),
(11). Again, nothing in the statutes pertaining
to the Committee's authority to
issue a subpoena precludes the use of the
subpoena to obtain confidential information.

<P20>[&para;57] Seeking the child protective records
to facilitate its determinations in regard
to OPEGA's report would be entirely
consistent with the Committee's enabling
statute. Such information may be needed
for the Committee to "question[] public
officials about [OPEGA's] findings and recommendations"
per section 994(4) or to
determine whether to endorse OPEGA's
recommendations per section 994(7). Such
a request would allow the Committee to
act on its statutory duties and thus would
not constitute an independent evaluation of
<Page 1132>
the Department's child protective services
by the Committee.

<P20>[&para;58] The Committee's pursuit of confidential
information in this limited context
would be more in line with the statutory
posture of the legislative investigating
committee in <EM>Maine Sugar Industries,
Inc. v. Maine Industrial Building Authority,</EM>
264 A.2d 1 (Me. 1970). Both matters
involve a legitimate investigation into a
subject matter clearly within the remit of
the respective legislative committees. <EM>See
id.</EM> at 3-4. Although the Committee cannot
conduct its own investigation, the Committee,
like the one in <EM>Maine Sugar,</EM> has
subpoena power that it may use to obtain
confidential information in order to meet
its legislative duties. <EM>See id.</EM> at 4. In both
instances, the subpoena serves a legitimate
legislative duty&mdash;in <EM>Maine Sugar,</EM> it was
the direct pursuit of an investigation, and
here, it is the prudent exercise of discretion
to review OPEGA's report, determine
whether or to what degree to endorse it,
and decide whether to propose legislation
to implement OPEGA's recommendations.
<EM>See</EM> 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994(4), (7). Further, as was
true of 10 M.R.S.A. &sect; 852 (Supp. 1970) in
<EM>Maine Sugar,</EM><fnr17> the statute here that purportedly
bars the Committee's access to
confidential information, 22 M.R.S. &sect; 4008
(2024), does not do so expressly.<fnr18>

<P20>[&para;59] Fundamentally, the Court's opinion
contends that the language in 22
<Page 1133>
M.R.S. &sect; 4008(3)(D) is so awkwardly
phrased it cannot be read to refer to the
Committee. Given the usual and customary
way that the Legislature organizes itself to
do its work, however, it is entirely logical,
unsurprising, and within the plain meaning
of section 4008(3)(D) that the members of
the Committee fall within the ambit of this
provision. The Committee has clear authority
over this substantive area of law as
a result of the evaluation of child protective
services conducted at the Committee's
behest. Similarly, although its authority is
subject to durational limits<fnr19>&mdash;by directing,
overseeing, and reviewing an evaluation
of the adequacy and effectiveness of
child protective services; determining
whether to endorse the report on the evaluation;
and exercising discretion over
whether to propose legislation to implement
the findings and recommendations
from the report on the evaluation of the
Department&mdash;the Committee has actual,
specific, and unambiguous statutory responsibility
for the provision of child protective
services in the immediate circumstances
before this Court.<fnr20> Therefore,
each member of the Committee literally
meets and satisfies the plain meaning of
the words "[a] legislative official with responsibility
for child protective services"
as set forth in 22 M.R.S. &sect; 4008(3)(D), thus
mandating disclosure to the Committee,
consistent with its enabling statute.<fnr21>

<P20>[&para;60] It is therefore axiomatic that the
Committee constitutes a body of legislative
officials that could need the Department's
confidential information to carry out its
responsibilities to protect children from
abuse and neglect. "It is the proper duty
of a [legislative] body to look diligently
into every affair of government .... It is
meant to be the eyes and the voice, and to
embody the wisdom and will of its constituents.
Unless [the Legislature] ha[s] and
use[s] every means of acquainting itself
with the acts and the disposition of the
administrative agents of the government,
the [state] must be helpless to learn how it
is being served." <EM>Trump v. Mazars USA,
LLP,</EM> 591 U.S. 848, 865, 140 S.Ct. 2019, 207
L.Ed.2d 951 (2020) (quotation marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;61] In the instant matter, as of the
time the Committee issued its subpoena
(and then sought to enforce it), the Committee
had not yet received (i) any of
<Page 1134>
OPEGA's evaluations on the Department's
handling of investigations regarding the
four deceased children to supplement the
report on child protective services investigations,
or (ii) the final phase of the comprehensive
review&mdash;An Evaluation Report
on Protecting Child Safety &mdash; Reunification
and Permanency.<fnr22> Thus, the Committee
would not have been in a position to discern
whether it needed access to the confidential
files in order to determine whether
to fully endorse, endorse in part, or withhold
endorsement of the reports or propose
legislation based on them. The judgment
therefore should be affirmed on
these grounds rather than those set forth
in the Court's opinion.

<P20>[&para;62] Accordingly, although I affirm the
denial of the request to compel compliance
with the subpoena at issue here, I do not
believe that this ruling precludes the future
issuance of a subpoena for the confidential
child protection records or, if necessary,
the filing of a motion to compel
compliance with such a subpoena, so long
as the Committee is taking such action in
order to review and determine whether it
endorses the OPEGA reports and to determine
what, if any, legislation to propose to
implement OPEGA's findings and recommendations.
Despite the circuitous nature
of the authority to access confidential information
fashioned by the Legislature at
issue here, the Committee nonetheless has
that authority and may bring it to bear in
appropriate circumstances.<fnr23>
<FN>
<fnt*> Although Justice Jabar participated in this appeal,
he retired before this opinion was certified.

<fnt1> The Committee advances a third argument
for the first time on appeal, namely that under
our decision in <EM>Maine Sugar Industries,
Inc. v. Maine Industrial Building Authority,</EM>
264 A.2d 1 (Me. 1970), the Committee has
inherent legislative power to compel an executive
agency to disclose confidential information
via subpoena. The Department objects to
our consideration of this issue because it was
not raised before the trial court and therefore
has not been preserved. We address this issue
below. <EM>See infra</EM> &para;&para; 37-45.

<fnt2> The "office" referenced throughout the
OPEGA statute is OPEGA itself. 3 M.R.S.
&sect; 992(3) (2024).

<fnt3> The statute also establishes detailed protocols
for protecting those records, and information
derived from those records, that are in
the possession of OPEGA or reflected in the
working papers of its staff. For example, even
before beginning an evaluation "that may require
access to records containing confidential
or privileged information," OPEGA must
alert the subject agency in writing and consult
with agency representatives "to discuss methods
of identifying and protecting privileged or
confidential information in those records." 3
M.R.S. &sect; 997(4)(A) (2024). OPEGA must "limit
its access" to such information "by appropriate
methods, which may include examining
records without copying or removing them
from the source." <EM>Id.</EM>

<fnt4> Even OPEGA's working papers that reflect
such confidential information are deemed
"confidential and exempt from disclosure
pursuant to Title 1, chapter 13, <EM>including disclosure
to the Legislative Council or an agent
or representative of the Legislative Council.</EM>"
<EM>Id.</EM> &sect; 997(3) (emphasis added); <EM>see also</EM> 3
M.R.S. &sect; 992(7) (2024) (defining "[w]orking
paper" as "all documentary and other information
acquired, prepared or maintained by
the office during the conduct of a program
evaluation").

<fnt5> Title 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994 (2024) specifies that the
Committee has the following duties: (1) evaluate,
and recommend reappointment of, the
director of OPEGA; (2) review and approve
OPEGA's annual workplan; (3) direct OPEGA
to conduct program evaluations; (3-A) request
the State Auditor or other qualified auditor to
conduct all or part of a program evaluation
when the Committee determines a qualified
auditor is required; (4) "hold public hearings
<EM>for the purpose of receiving reports from the
office and questioning public officials about
office findings and recommendations</EM>"; (5) "examine
witnesses and ... order the appearance
of any person or the appearance of any
person for the purpose of production to the
committee of papers or records, including
books, accounts, documents, computer disks
or memory or other electronic media and
other materials regardless of their physical or
electronic form"; (6) "administer oaths to witnesses
appearing before the committee"; (7)
"vote at the committee's discretion to endorse,
to endorse in part or to release a report
of the office without endorsement"; (8) "issue
subpoenas[, which <EM>must be issued pursuant to
the provisions of section 165 and chapter 21,</EM>]
upon a majority vote of the committee in the
event of refusal to appear or to produce papers
or records, including books, accounts,
documents, computer disks or memory or
other electronic media and other materials
regardless of their physical or electronic
form"; (9) "conduct meetings"; (10) "adopt
rules"; (11) "<EM>receive certain information,</EM>"
which "<EM>is governed by chapter 21, which governs
legislative investigating committees, and
by Title 1, chapter 13, which governs public
records and proceedings</EM>"; and (12) establish a
system for immediate review of a program or
function of a state agency or other entity
when major mismanagement of public funds
or functions is suspected. (Emphasis added.)

<fnt6> As discussed below, <EM>see infra</EM> &para; 25, the Legislature
used the identical language referencing
"Title 1, chapter 13" on an earlier occasion
when it temporarily removed OPEGA's access
to privileged and confidential information and
confined OPEGA to accessing publicly available
information.

<fnt7> This reference to chapter 21 of Title 3 parallels
section 994(8)'s qualification of the
Committee's subpoena power. Section 994(8)
provides: "A subpoena issued under this subsection
must be issued pursuant to the provisions
of section 165 and chapter 21." Title 3
M.R.S. &sect; 165 (2024) defines the authority of
joint standing committees and joint select
committees. As mentioned above, the Committee
was established as a "joint legislative
committee." 3 M.R.S. &sect; 992(1). As relevant
here, section 165(7) provides:

<B22>When the duties assigned to a committee so
require, the Legislature may grant to it the
power to administer oaths, issue subpoenas,
compel the attendance of witnesses and the
production of any papers, books, accounts,
documents and testimony and to cause the
deposition of witnesses, whether residing
within or without the State, to be taken in
the manner prescribed by law for taking
depositions in civil actions in the Superior
Court. When the Legislature grants this
power to a joint standing committee or
joint select committee, such committee
functions as an investigating committee and
is subject to the provisions of chapter 21.

<P00>Here, the Committee has been granted the
power to order the appearance of any person,
administer oaths, and issue subpoenas in the
event of a refusal to appear or produce documents.
3 M.R.S. &sect; 994(5)-(6), (8). It does not
appear that the OPEGA statute grants the
Committee the authority to conduct depositions.

<fnt8> As amended and finally enacted, 3 M.R.S.A.
&sect; 991 (Supp. 2002) read essentially as it does
currently: "The Office of Program Evaluation
and Government Accountability is created for
the purpose of providing program evaluation
of agencies and programs of State Government."
P.L. 2001, ch. 702, &sect; 2 (effective July
25, 2002).

<fnt9> The Committee cites another statutory exception
to the confidentiality of child protective
records in 22 M.R.S. &sect; 4008 (2024)&mdash;
namely subsection 3(I)&mdash;as a basis for its
access. Section 4008(3)(I) mandates disclosure
to a "government entity that needs such
information in order to carry out its responsibilities
under law to protect children from
abuse and neglect." The plain language of this
provision does not support the Committee's
argument. It is a stretch to believe that the
Legislature would consider or reference one
of its committees as a "government entity"
without being more specific. Even if the Committee
is included within that generic term,
neither the Committee as a whole nor its
individual members have specific "responsibilities
under law to protect children from
abuse and neglect." <EM>Id.</EM> Again, the duties of
the Committee are expressly set out in the
statute, 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994, and those duties do
not include protection of children from abuse
or neglect. We find more persuasive the Department's
interpretation of section
4008(3)(I), namely that it is intended to facilitate
sharing of child-specific information
among governmental entities responsible for
the day-to-day enforcement of child protection
laws.

<fnt10> The confidentiality statute at issue in
<EM>Maine Sugar,</EM> read, in relevant part, "No
member of the authority, agent or employee
thereof shall divulge or disclose any information
obtained from the records and files or by
virtue of such person's office concerning the
name of any lessee or tenant or information
supplied by any lessee, tenant, mortgagee or
local development corporation in support of
an application for mortgage insurance." 10
M.R.S.A. &sect; 852 (Supp. 1970) (repealed and
replaced by P.L. 1981, ch. 476, &sect; 1 (effective
Oct. 1, 1981)).

<fnt11> At the time the Committee made its request
for the records in this case, OPEGA
staff were "well into deeply reviewing every
document [and] every report."

<fnt12> The Committee is a bipartisan joint legislative
committee, composed of an equal number
of members from the two largest political
parties in each chamber of the Legislature.
Joint Rule 371 (131st Legis.).

<fnt13> Title 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994 (2024) specifies that
the Committee has, inter alia, the following
duties: to review and approve OPEGA's annual
workplan; to direct OPEGA to conduct
program evaluations; "[t]o hold public hearings
<EM>for the purpose of receiving reports from
[OPEGA] and questioning public officials
about [OPEGA's] findings and recommendations</EM>";
"[t]o examine witnesses and to order
the appearance of any person or <EM>the appearance
of any person for the purpose of production
to the [C]ommittee of papers or records,
including books, accounts, documents, computer
disks or memory or other electronic media
and other materials regardless of their
physical or electronic form</EM>"; to administer
oaths to witnesses appearing before the Committee;
"<EM>[t]o vote at the [C]ommittee's discretion
to endorse, to endorse in part or to release
a report of [OPEGA] without endorsement</EM>";
"<EM>[t]o issue subpoenas</EM> [pursuant to the provisions
of section 165 and chapter 21] <EM>upon a
majority vote of the [C]ommittee in the event of
refusal to appear or to produce papers or records,
including books, accounts, documents,
computer disks or memory or other electronic
media and other materials regardless of their
physical or electronic form</EM>"; to conduct meetings;
to adopt rules; "[t]o <EM>receive certain information</EM>
[in accordance with] <EM>chapter 21,
which governs legislative investigating committees,
and ... Title 1, chapter 13, which governs
public records and proceedings</EM>"; and "[t]o establish
a system to provide immediate review
of a program or function of a state agency or
other entity [when] major mismanagement of
public funds or functions" is suspected.

<P00>(Emphasis added.)

<fnt14> Under Title 3, chapter 37, the Committee
alone determines the subject matter and
scope of the evaluations and investigations
conducted by OPEGA. 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994(3); 3
M.R.S. &sect; 992(1). <EM>See also</EM> 3 M.R.S. &sect; 412
(2024) ("The authorization creating an investigating
committee shall clearly state, and
thereby limit, the subject matter and scope of
the study or investigation."). Here, in July
2021, after four children died despite the Department's
involvement, the Committee directed
OPEGA to conduct an immediate review
of the Department's child protective
services. OPEGA developed a three-phase
comprehensive review plan to evaluate the
adequacy and effectiveness of the child protective
services provided by the Department.
In August 2021, the Committee approved the
scope of the work in the review of child
protective services to include the following:

<B24>&bull; An Information Brief on Oversight of
Child Protective Services due by January
2022;

<B24>&bull; An Evaluation Report on Protecting
Child Safety &mdash; Initial Investigation and
Assessment due by March 2022; and

<B24>&bull; An Evaluation Report on Protecting
Child Safety &mdash; Reunification and Permanency
due by September 2022.

<fnt15> The Court's opinion, like the trial court's
opinion, points to the 2005 Opinion of the
Attorney General, which concluded that 3
M.R.S. &sect; 994(11) does not permit confidential
records to be shared with the Committee. As
we have repeatedly observed, even our own
advisory opinions have no precedential value
or conclusive effect. <EM>See, e.g., Op. of the Justices,</EM>
2017 ME 100, &para; 9, 162 A.3d 188. This is
the norm where advisory opinions are issued
by a state's highest court. <EM>See Irons v. R.I.
Ethics Comm'n,</EM> 973 A.2d 1124 n.15 (R.I.
2009). Similarly, we are not bound by an
advisory opinion of the Attorney General. <EM>See
Stewart Title Guaranty Co. v. State Tax Assessor,</EM>
2009 ME 8, &para; 19, 963 A.2d 169. <EM>See also
Swepi, LP v. Mora Cnty.,</EM> 81 F.Supp. 3d 1075,
1193 (2015) (stating that attorney general advisory
opinions and letters do not have the
force of law). The 2005 Opinion of the Attorney
General therefore has no precedential
value and its conclusion regarding the Committee's
access to the Department's confidential
records need not be accorded any weight
for the purposes of the matter before us. Further,
it is not unusual, as occurred here before
the court, for the Office of the Attorney
General to actually take opposing positions on
policy and litigation. <EM>Cf. Op. of the Justices,</EM>
2015 ME 27, &para; 23 n.3, 112 A.3d 926.

<fnt16> The Committee cannot issue a subpoena
unless there is a majority vote of its members
in favor of doing so. 3 M.R.S. &sect; 994(8).

<fnt17> The Court's opinion notes that, during the
pendency of the appeal in <EM>Maine Sugar,</EM> the
Legislature passed an amendment to the statute
at issue, 10 M.R.S.A. &sect; 852 (Supp. 1970).
This amendment made the confidential information
shielded by the statute subject to disclosure
to a special interim legislative investigative
committee pursuant to a subpoena
issued by the committee upon a future effective
date. The Court's opinion concludes that
the amendment therefore made clear the
Legislature's ultimate intent on the disclosure
of the information to the Committee.
The <EM>Maine Sugar</EM> Court, however, explicitly
set forth that its conclusion that section 852
did not prohibit mandatory disclosure of the
confidential information in response to the
legislative committee's subpoena was its interpretation
of the statute (a) as it stood prior
to the amendment and (b) independent of
the construct of the amendment on its future
effective date. <EM>Me. Sugar,</EM> 264 A.2d at 6.

<P20>The Court's opinion suggests that, notwithstanding
the statute's language, <EM>Maine Sugar</EM>
requires a balancing test to determine whether
access should be afforded to the Committee,
and that in this matter that test would
lead to the denial of access. Here, the deaths
within a three-month span of four children
whose families had been involved with the
Department heightened concerns for the safety
of Maine children and highlighted the need
for legislative intervention to address potential
systemic issues in the provision of child
welfare services. The Committee therefore directed
OPEGA to immediately perform an
evaluation of the Department's provision of
child protective services. As that evaluation
proceeds, the Committee reasonably could
conclude that examination of the Department's
case records is needed in order to
fulfill its duty to get to the root causes of these
child welfare issues and to fashion an appropriate
legislative solution for what is discovered.
Moreover, section 4008 makes clear that
(a) the Department's confidential records may
be used only for the purposes for which the
release was intended, and (b) the knowing
dissemination of the confidential records is a
Class E crime. 22 M.R.S. &sect; 4008(1), (4). On
these facts, the result of a balancing test is not
necessarily the foregone conclusion that the
Court's opinion suggests.

<fnt18> In response to section 4008's lack of an
express bar on the Committee's access to the
Department's case records, the Court's opinion
narrowly construes statutory exceptions
to FOAA to conclude that none of the exceptions
set forth in section 4008 justify disclosure
to the Committee. But, as argued <EM>supra</EM>
n.17, under the <EM>Maine Sugar</EM> balancing test
that contention is at best uncertain. Moreover,
the Court's contention may be entirely
misplaced under a plain reading of the language
in section 4008(3)(D) that interprets the
language so as to avoid absurd, illogical, or
inconsistent results; give all of the words
meaning; and view it in the context of the
entire statutory scheme so as to generate a
harmonious result.

<fnt19> The Committee's authority is durationally
limited due to the unique way that the Committee's
enabling statute delegates selective
legislative authority to it. <EM>See</EM> 3 M.R.S. &sect;&sect; 991,
994. Notably, this self-determined "targeted-task"
authority exercised by the Committee in
the discretion afforded to it through its enabling
statute is not unlike the express "targeted-task"
authority delegated to the "Special
Interim Legislative Committee" in <EM>Maine
Sugar. Me. Sugar,</EM> 264 A.2d at 3-4.

<fnt20> Interestingly, OPEGA's report on child
protective services, as a part of the legislative
oversight of child protective services, notes
two areas for further consideration by the
Committee in regard to the child protective
services system: (i) the provision of services
for children and families in the system and (ii)
the prevention of child abuse and neglect in
the context of giving attention to the three
levels of prevention identified by the experts.

<fnt21> This analysis is equally applicable to section
4008(3)(I), which mandates access to
confidential information held by the Department
for "any [state] government[al] entity"
or agent of such an entity that needs such
information in order to carry out its responsibilities
under law to protect children from
abuse and neglect. Based on the plain meaning
of this language, the Committee constitutes
a state governmental entity and thus
each member of the Committee is an agent of
a state governmental entity. As noted above,
<EM>supra</EM> &para;&para; 56-57, the authority and duties delegated
to the Committee through its enabling
statute could make access to the Department's
confidential information necessary for
the Committee to carry out its responsibilities
under law to protect children from abuse and
neglect.

<fnt22> The record does not show that these items
were not yet received at the time of the Committee's
subpoena and motion to compel.
However, OPEGA's February 2024 Information
Brief on Child Protective Services Reunification
confirms that the Committee had not
yet received these items at the time of its
subpoena and motion. <EM>See</EM> Information Brief &mdash;
Child Protective Services Reunification 1
(Feb. 2024). A court may take judicial notice
of facts when the accuracy of the source cannot
reasonably be questioned. <EM>See</EM> M.R. Evid.
201(b). We have long held that we may take
judicial notice of facts on appeal. <EM>See, e.g.,
Nader v. Me. Democratic Party,</EM> 2013 ME 51,
&para; 20 n.10, 66 A.3d 571 ("[W]e may take judicial
notice."); <EM>State v. Moulton,</EM> 1997 ME 228,
&para; 17, 704 A.2d 361 ("We may take judicial
notice on appeal."); <EM>First Nat'l Bank of Bost.
v. Me. Tpk. Auth.,</EM> 153 Me. 131, 136 A.2d 699,
714 (1957) ("We may take judicial notice of
[this] fact."); <EM>Goodwin v. Small,</EM> 92 Me. 588,
43 A. 507, 507 (1899), ("[W]e may take judicial
notice of the fact."). The accuracy of the
timeline provided by OPEGA's Information
Brief cannot reasonably be questioned, and
therefore we may take judicial notice of the
timeline regarding OPEGAs final report and
the four evaluations.

<fnt23> Given the gulf between the views on this
point expressed in the Court's opinion and
this concurrence, the Legislature may well
want to consider clarifying the scope of the
Committee's authority to access confidential
information in these circumstances.

<P20>[&para;1] The relevant facts are not disputed.
Between 2007 and 2009, Susan McCarthy's
minor child ("M") spent time in the care of
McCarthy's friend, Glynis McCormack, at
McCormack's home. McCormack's minor
nephew and ward ("Z") also lived there. At
various times while McCormack took care
of M, Z physically, sexually, and emotionally
abused M. As a result, M suffered from
ongoing mental health issues.
<Page 1136>

<P20>[&para;2] McCormack was insured under a
homeowner's policy issued by Metropolitan
Property and Casualty Insurance Company.
As detailed below, McCarthy obtained
a consent judgment against McCormack;
its terms provided that McCarthy would
recover a limited amount from McCormack
directly and then seek to recover the remainder
from Metropolitan as McCormack's
insurer. Metropolitan subsequently
obtained a judgment from the Superior
Court (York County, <EM>Mulhern, J.</EM>) declaring
that it had no duty to indemnify
McCormack for the consent judgment.

<P20>[&para;3] McCarthy appeals from the declaratory
judgment. M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(1). We
conclude that the trial court did not err
and affirm the judgment.

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<HN02><EMB>A. McCarthy Complaint</EMB>

<P20>[&para;4] In May 2012, McCarthy, on behalf
of herself and M, filed a complaint in the
Superior Court against McCormack, individually
and as guardian of Z. The complaint
was later amended to allege six
counts: negligence (Count 1); negligent infliction
of emotional distress (Count 2);
assault and battery (Count 3); intentional
infliction of emotional distress (Count 4);
breach of fiduciary duty (Count 5); and
premises liability (Count 6). McCarthy
agrees that there is no insurance coverage
for Counts 2, 3, and 4.

<HN02><EMB>B. Metropolitan Federal Complaint</EMB>

<P20>[&para;5] In May 2012, Metropolitan filed a
complaint for declaratory judgment
against McCormack and McCarthy in the
United States District Court, asserting
that it had no duty to defend or indemnify
McCormack against McCarthy's complaint
because two exclusions in McCormack's
homeowner's policy applied to bar coverage
&mdash;an "abuse" exclusion and an "intentional
loss" exclusion. <EM>Metro. Prop. & Cas.
Ins. Co. v. McCarthy,</EM> No. 2:12-CV-151-NT,
2013 WL 12061851, at *1, 3 (D. Me. June
10, 2013). The court declared that under
the facts alleged in the complaint, Metropolitan
had a duty to defend McCormack
and that Metropolitan "may not litigate its
potential duty to indemnify McCormack
before McCormack's liability is determined."
<EM>Id.</EM> at *5. On appeal, the United
States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
affirmed. <EM>Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co.
v. McCarthy,</EM> 754 F.3d 47, 51 (1st Cir.
2014).

<HN02><EMB>C. Consent Judgment</EMB>

<P20>[&para;6] While Metropolitan's complaint for
declaratory judgment was pending in the
federal courts, McCarthy and McCormack
entered into a settlement agreement providing
that (1) judgment would be entered
for McCarthy on all counts of her amended
complaint in the amount of $300,000; (2)
McCormack would pay McCarthy $30,000;
and (3) McCarthy would not attempt to
collect any further amount from McCormack
personally, instead pursuing the remainder
of the $300,000 judgment from
Metropolitan after McCormack assigned
her policy rights to McCarthy pursuant to
Maine's reach and apply statute, 24-A
M.R.S. &sect; 2904 (2013).<fnr1> In December 2013,
the Superior Court entered a consent
judgment in accordance with the settlement
agreement. Metropolitan stipulated
that it had proper notice and that the
settlement was reasonable and not the
product of fraud or collusion. <EM>See id.</EM>

<HN02><EMB>D. Metropolitan Superior Court Complaint/McCarthy
Counterclaim</EMB>

<P20>[&para;7] In November 2015, Metropolitan
filed in the Superior Court the complaint
<Page 1137>
for declaratory judgment that is the subject
of this appeal. The complaint alleged
that, for several reasons, Metropolitan had
no duty to indemnify McCormack for the
consent judgment, the most pertinent reason
here being Metropolitan's assertion
that application of the policy's "intentional
loss" and "abuse" exclusions meant there
was no coverage for McCarthy's claims.

<P20>[&para;8] McCarthy responded with a three-count
counterclaim, asserting breach of
contract (Count 1); application of section
2904 to reach McCormack's coverage
(Count 2); and unfair claims settlement
practices (Count 3), alleging that Metropolitan
"without just cause failed to effectuate
a prompt, fair and equitable settlement
of [McCarthy's] claims submitted,
upon which liability had become reasonably
clear."

<P20>[&para;9] In July 2022, the court held a bench
trial on Metropolitan's complaint and
Counts 1 and 2 of McCarthy's counterclaim;
trial on Count 3 of the counterclaim
was scheduled to be heard separately at a
later date. In September 2022, the court
entered judgment for Metropolitan on all
counts of its complaint and on Counts 1
and 2 of McCarthy's counterclaim, concluding
that "the bodily injuries sustained
by [M] are not covered by the insurance
policy under both the intentional loss and
abuse exclusions, and [consequently] Metropolitan
has no duty to indemnify for the
Consent Judgment."

<HN02><EMB>E. Subsequent Procedural Events</EMB>

<P20>[&para;10] McCarthy moved the court for further
findings and to alter or amend the
judgment. <EM>See</EM> M.R. Civ. P. 52(b), 59(e).
The court denied the motions, concluding
that the matter was "correctly decided"
and that "all necessary and appropriate
factual findings ha[d] been made."

<P20>[&para;11] Metropolitan then moved to dismiss
Count 3 of the counterclaim pursuant
to M.R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), asserting that the
court's ruling that there was no coverage
for McCarthy's claims was "in effect a
determination that Metropolitan had `just
cause' in denying coverage for the Consent
Judgment," and so "there is no basis in
law and fact for the claim asserted ... in
Count III of [the] Counterclaim." The
court agreed and dismissed Count 3.

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<P20>[&para;12] The primary issue on appeal
is whether the trial court erred in
construing the "intentional loss" and
"abuse" exclusions in McCormack's policy
to bar coverage for McCarthy's claims.<fnr2>
"We ... review de novo whether the trial
court made any errors of law in interpreting
coverage under an insurance policy."
<EM>MMG Ins. Co. v. Estate of Greenlaw,</EM> 2024
ME 28, &para; 14, 314 A.3d 262 (alteration and
quotation marks omitted). In conducting
that review, we apply established rules of
construction:

<B22>A provision of an insurance contract is
ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible
of different interpretations or if any ordinary
person in the shoes of the insured
would not understand that the
policy did not cover claims such as those
brought. If an insurance contract contains
an ambiguity, then that ambiguity
is construed strictly against the insurer
and liberally in favor of the insured.
Unambiguous contract language, however,
<Page 1138>
must be interpreted according to its
plain meaning.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> (citations and quotation marks omitted).

<HN00><EMB>A. Policy Language</EMB>

<P20>[&para;13] The "intentional loss" exclusion in
McCormack's policy provides, in pertinent
part:

<B22><EMB>Intentional Loss. We</EMB> do not cover <EMB>bodily
injury</EMB> or <EMB>property damage</EMB> which is
reasonably expected or intended by <EMB>you</EMB>
or which is the result of <EMB>your</EMB> intentional
and criminal acts or omissions. This exclusion
is applicable even if:

<B22>A. <EMB>you</EMB> lack the mental capacity to govern
<EMB>your</EMB> conduct;

<B22>B. such <EMB>bodily injury</EMB> or <EMB>property damage</EMB>
is of a different kind or degree than
reasonably expected or intended by <EMB>you;</EMB>
or

<B22>C. such <EMB>bodily injury</EMB> or <EMB>property damage</EMB>
is sustained by a different person
than expected or intended by <EMB>you.</EMB>

<B22>This exclusion applies regardless of
whether <EMB>you</EMB> are actually charged with
or convicted of a crime....

<P20>[&para;14] The "abuse" exclusion in the policy
provides:

<B22><EMB>Abuse. We</EMB> do not cover <EMB>bodily injury</EMB>
caused by or resulting from the actual,
alleged or threatened sexual molestation
or contact, corporal punishment, physical
abuse, mental abuse or emotional
abuse of a person. This exclusion applies
whether the <EMB>bodily injury</EMB> is inflicted by
<EMB>you</EMB> or directed by <EMB>you</EMB> for another person
to inflict sexual molestation or contact,
corporal punishment, physical
abuse, mental abuse or emotional abuse
upon a person.

<P20>[&para;15] Concerning both policy exclusions,
the term "you" is explicitly defined:

<B22><EMB>"You"</EMB> and <EMB>"your"</EMB> mean:

<B22>1. the person or persons named in the
Declarations and if a resident of the
same household:

<B22>A. the spouse of such person or persons;

<B22>B. the relatives of either; or

<B22>C. any other person under the age of
twenty-one in the care of any of the
above ....

<HN00><EMB>B. Analysis</EMB>

<P20>[&para;16] The parties stipulated that "[Z]
meets the definition of `you' under the
Metropolitan polic[y] ..., and is an insured."
McCarthy concedes that under the
plain language of the policy, Z is excluded
from coverage for the abusive acts he intentionally
committed against M. McCarthy
contends that the term "you" as used
in the exclusions does not include McCormack,
however, because it was Z, not
McCormack, who abused M.

<P20>[&para;17] We agree with Metropolitan's argument
and conclude that because Z, as
stipulated by the parties, and McCormack,
as a "person[] named in the Declarations,"
both fall within the policy definition of
"you," Z's acts, which are excluded from
coverage as to Z, are also excluded with
respect to McCormack. Under the "intentional
loss" exclusion, the policy plainly
does not provide coverage for bodily injury
if it was intentionally committed by any
person qualifying as "you." Likewise, the
"abuse" exclusion removes from coverage
any bodily injury "caused by or resulting
from ... sexual molestation or contact,
corporal punishment, physical abuse, mental
abuse or emotional abuse" inflicted by a
person qualifying as "you." Because there
is no dispute that Z intentionally inflicted
bodily injury on M by physically, sexually,
and emotionally abusing M, and because
both Z and McCormack&mdash;as persons defined
as "you" under the policy&mdash;are subject
to the "intentional loss" and "abuse"
exclusions for those acts, the court correctly
determined that there is no coverage for
McCarthy's claims.
<Page 1139>

<P20>[&para;18] Our conclusion, grounded in the
plain language of the policy, is confirmed
in the policy's first clause, which states in
part:

<B22>The terms of this policy impose joint
obligations on all persons defined as
<EMB>you.</EMB> This means that the responsibilities,
acts and failures to act of a person
defined as <EMB>you</EMB> will be binding upon
another person defined as <EMB>you.</EMB>

<P20>[&para;19] This clause, and the other policy
language we have discussed, leads to a
clear result&mdash;the trial court did not err in
declaring that "the bodily injuries sustained
by [M] are not covered by the insurance
policy under both the intentional
loss and abuse exclusions, and ... Metropolitan
has no duty to indemnify for the
Consent Judgment." <EM>See Estate of Greenlaw,</EM>
2024 ME 28, &para; 14, 314 A.3d 262.

<P20>The entry is:

<P20>Judgment affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt1> Minor textual amendments to the statute
have since been enacted. R.R. 2021, ch. 1,
&sect; B-254, correcting gender-specific language,
explanation; P.L. 2023, ch. 405, &sect; A-90 (emergency,
effective July 10, 2023).

<fnt2> McCarthy asserts that public policy does not
prohibit insurance coverage for McCormack's
alleged negligence concerning Z's intentional
acts of sexual abuse. Given our conclusion
that the unambiguous language of the policy
excludes coverage for McCarthy's claims, we
do not reach that issue. McCarthy also contends
that the court abused its discretion in
denying her motion for further findings of
fact We do not find that argument persuasive
and do not discuss it further.

<P20>[&para;1] The question presented in this appeal
is what relief, if any, airline passengers
may obtain when an airline precludes
their travel without explanation.

<P20>[&para;2] Campbell and Jennie Clegg appeal
from a judgment of the Superior Court
(Cumberland County, <EM>MG Kennedy, J.</EM>)
granting the motion of American Airlines,
Inc., for summary judgment on the Cleggs'
claims for breach of contract (Count 1),
fraud (Count 2), and breach of the Maine
Unfair Trade Practices Act, 5 M.R.S.
&sect; 213(1) (2024) (Count 3) on the basis that
the Cleggs' claims are preempted under
the Airline Deregulation Act. <EM>See</EM> M. R.
Civ. P. 56; 49 U.S.C.A. &sect; 41713(b)(1)
(Westlaw through Pub. L. No. 118-107).
We vacate the judgment because we conclude
that while relief is limited, it is not
totally foreclosed: the Cleggs may have a
breach of contract claim that is not
preempted because it is based on American's
Conditions of Carriage, with damages
limited to "a full amount of the ticket
and any extras" for their curtailed travel.
<Page 1141>

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<HN00><EMB>A. The Undisputed Facts</EMB>

<P20>[&para;3] The facts, as set out in the parties'
supported statements of material facts and
viewed in the light most favorable to the
Cleggs, see <EM>Scott v. Fall Line Condo.
Ass'n,</EM> 2019 ME 50, &para; 5, 206 A.3d 307, are
as follows. In February 2022, the Cleggs
purchased from American Airlines first-class
round-trip tickets for themselves and
three other members of their family for
travel between Albany, New York, and
San Francisco, California, departing in
May 2022. When they purchased the tickets,
the Cleggs agreed to American's Conditions
of Carriage, which formed a part of
the contract for travel between the Cleggs
and the Airline. <EM>See</EM> 14 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 221.1-221.600,
253.1-253.10 (2024).

<P20>[&para;4] The Conditions of Carriage specified
that "[t]o the extent not preempted by
federal law, Texas law applies to this contract
...." The conditions required passengers
to check in "[a]t least 45 minutes
before scheduled departure, for flights
within the U.S." A web page linked to the
conditions titled "Check-in and arrival"
recommended arriving at the airport at
least two hours before a flight "to allow
plenty of time to check in." In a section
titled "Involuntary refunds," the conditions
stated:

<B22>If you are due a refund because we
failed to operate on schedule (a delay to
your departure time of over 4 hours) or
we refused to let you fly for reasons
other than your violation of this contract,
we will refund you ... the full
amount of the ticket and any extras if
travel hasn't started.

<P00>Additionally, the conditions contained a
"Limit of liability" provision that provided,
"You agree we are not liable for special,
consequential, indirect or incidental damages
that arise from this agreement ...."

<P20>[&para;5] The night before their flight, the
Cleggs were unable to check in online
because American's online check-in system
did not permit them to complete the process
online and instructed them to check in
at the airport. The other three members of
their party were able to check in online.
On the morning of their flight, the Cleggs
arrived at the airport at 4:47 a.m. and
arrived at the ticket counter prior to 5:00
a.m. for their 6:04 a.m. scheduled departure.
At the ticket counter, three different
ticketing agents unsuccessfully attempted
to check the Cleggs in for their flight.
While the agents could see the reservation
and that seats had been assigned to the
Cleggs, American's computer system
would not let the agents complete the
check-in process. American never resolved
the issue, and the Cleggs were unable to
check in before the cut-off time of forty-five
minutes prior to the flight.

<P20>[&para;6] The Cleggs then aver&mdash;and the Airline
admitted for purposes of summary
judgment&mdash;that based on recommendations
and representations made by a gate
agent, the Cleggs booked a flight from
Boston, Massachusetts, to San Francisco
on a different airline. When the Cleggs
attempted to check in for their return
flight from San Francisco on American,
they learned that American had cancelled
their flight because they did not board the
original outbound flight. The Cleggs never
received a refund for their outbound or
return flights.

<HN00><EMB>B. The Procedural Background</EMB>

<P20>[&para;7] The Cleggs filed a three-count complaint
against American in July 2022, alleging
breach of contract, fraud, and breach
of the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act, 5
M.R.S. &sect; 213(1). They sought actual, consequential,
and punitive damages and their
attorney fees.

<P20>[&para;8] American moved for summary judgment
as to the entirety of the Cleggs'
claims, arguing that their claims were
<Page 1142>
preempted under the Airline Deregulation
Act. The court agreed, and the Cleggs
timely appealed. <EM>See</EM> 14 M.R.S. &sect; 1851
(2024); M.R. App. P. 2B(c)(1).

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<HN02><EMB>A. The Cleggs may pursue a claim only
for a refund pursuant to the terms
of the Conditions of Carriage.</EMB>

<P20>[&para;9] The Airline Deregulation
Act preempts states from enacting or enforcing
"a law, regulation, or other provision
having the force and effect of law
related to a price, route, or service of an
air carrier." 49 U.S.C.A. &sect; 41713(b)(1);
<EM>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</EM> 504
U.S. 374, 383, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d
157 (1992). When a dispute falls into one of
these categories, the only avenue for and
measure of relief is enforcement of the
terms of the Conditions of Carriage. <EM>See
Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens,</EM> 513 U.S. 219,
228-29, 115 S.Ct. 817, 130 L.Ed.2d 715
(1995); <EM>Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. Black,</EM> 116
S.W.3d 745, 753-54 (Tex. 2003).<fnr1> Any state
law avenue of relief outside that permitted
under the Airline Deregulation Act is foreclosed
under the Supremacy Clause of the
United States Constitution, U.S. Const.
art. 6, cl. 2.

<P20>[&para;10] The Cleggs argue that their
claims are not preempted because their
claims do not relate to rates, routes, or
services. But ticketing, check-in, and
boarding procedures fall under the umbrella
of "services." <EM>See Bower v. Egyptair
Airlines Co.,</EM> 731 F.3d 85, 93-95, 98 (1st
Cir. 2013) (holding that the plaintiff's
claims regarding the airline's failure at
check-in and boarding to prevent the abduction
of the plaintiff's children related to
the airline's "services"); <EM>Hodges v. Delta
Airlines, Inc.,</EM> 44 F.3d 334, 339 (5th Cir.
1995) (en banc) (allowing claims alleging
wrongful exclusions from flights "would
result in significant <EM>de facto</EM> regulation of
the airlines' boarding practices"); <EM>Travel
All Over the World, Inc. v. Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia,</EM> 73 F.3d 1423, 1434 (7th Cir.
1996) ("[T]he proper examination ... is
not why the airline refused to provide its
services, but whether the claims at issue
either expressly refer to the airline's services
(which they clearly do) or would have
a significant economic effect on the airline's
services. The subjective motivations
of [the airline's] employees are irrelevant
to determining what constitutes `services'
within the meaning of the [Airline Deregulation
Act]." (citation omitted)).<fnr2>

<P20>[&para;11] Hence, the only non-preempted
cause of action for the Cleggs is enforcement
of the terms of the Conditions
of Carriage. The conditions provide:

<B22>If you are due a refund because we
failed to operate on schedule (a delay to
your departure time of over 4 hours) or
we refused to let you fly for reasons
other than your violation of this contract,
we will refund you ... [t]he full
amount of the ticket and extras if travel
hasn't started.

<P00>The Cleggs' claim alleges that because
they were unable to check in and obtain
<Page 1143>
transportation through no fault of their
own, American breached the Conditions of
Carriage by failing to provide what was
bargained for under the agreement&mdash;
transportation or a refund. Following the
guidance of the Court in <EM>Wolens,</EM> enforcing
this provision of the contract would hold
the parties to the terms set by the parties
themselves without enlargement or enhancement
based on state law or policies,
and thus the claim is not preempted by the
Act.

<P20>[&para;12] The trial court read this provision
of the Conditions of Carriage as indicating
only "how much" could be refunded and
accordingly concluded that the provision
did not on its own obligate American to
issue a refund under any particular circumstances.
The trial court held that the
preceding provisions, including the section
titled "Our responsibilities when there are
schedule/operations changes," explained
"when" American is obligated to issue a
refund. Nowhere else in the Conditions of
Carriage, however, is there an explicit provision
obligating American to render the
bargained-for transportation or a refund.
Accordingly, to read the provision as only
explaining "how much" American would be
obligated to refund would permit American
to opt not to perform its promises, making
the contract illusory and unenforceable under
Texas law. <EM>See City of The Colony v.
N. Tex. Mun. Water Dist.,</EM> 272 S.W.3d 699,
725 (Tex. App. 2008) ("A contract that
lacks mutuality of obligation is illusory and
void and thus unenforceable.").

<P20>[&para;13] The Cleggs contend in both
the complaint and at oral argument that
the remedies for the breach of contract
claim should include consequential damages
and their costs associated with bringing
the suit. But enforcement of the Conditions
of Carriage includes enforcement of
its provision regarding the relief to which
the Cleggs are entitled for a breach. <EM>See
Wolens,</EM> 513 U.S. at 229, 115 S.Ct. 817 ("A
remedy confined to a contract's terms simply
holds parties to their agreements.
..."); <EM>Norman v. Trans World Airlines,
Inc.,</EM> No. 98 Civ. 7419 (BSJ), 2000
WL 1480367, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 6, 2000)
("[The] remedy for any breach of the contract
of carriage between the parties is
limited to the remedies set forth in that
contract."); <EM>Power Standards Lab, Inc. v.
Fed. Express Corp.,</EM> 127 Cal.App.4th 1039,
26 Cal. Rptr. 3d 202, 203-04, 207-08 (2005)
(holding that a breach of contract claim
was preempted because the plaintiff
sought a California common law form of
attorney fees although the contract of carriage
had specified only actual and compensatory
damages).

<P20>[&para;14] Here, the Conditions of Carriage
limit the remedies to "[t]he full amount of
the ticket and any extras if travel hasn't
started" or "the value of the unused tickets
if the ticket is partially used." Further, the
"Limit of liability" provision explicitly disclaims
consequential damages. Because the
<EM>Wolens</EM> exception requires the remedies to
be limited to the contract's terms with no
enlargement or enhancement based on
state law, the Cleggs' recovery for breach
of contract is limited to a refund, and the
Airline Deregulation Act preempts and
precludes recovery of consequential and
punitive damages, attorney fees, and costs.

<CN><EMB>III. CONCLUSION</EMB>

<P20>[&para;15] The facts viewed in the light most
favorable to the Cleggs indicate that their
claims are preempted under the Airline
Deregulation Act except to the extent that
they seek to enforce the terms of the
Conditions of Carriage.<fnr3>

liability contained in the Conditions of
Carriage. The remainder of the judgment
is affirmed. Remanded for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion.
<FN>
<fnt1> <EM>Wolens</EM> and its progeny stand for the proposition
that the Airline Deregulation Act does

enforcement of contract terms set by the parties
themselves" with "no enlargement or enhancement

<fnt2> A refusal to allow boarding based on race or
other discriminatory practices may or may
not provide an exception to this rule, see 4
Federal Procedure, Lawyer's Edition &sect; 7:822
(2024) (citing decisions), but the Cleggs have
not alleged or produced evidence that the
Airline's conduct was based on such a practice.

<fnt3> In its brief and at oral argument, American
alluded to its recommendation to arrive at the
airport two hours early and suggested that it
would have behooved the Cleggs to arrive for
their flight earlier than 4:47 a.m. in order to
give the agents more time to try to fix the
computer glitch. We leave to the further proceedings
on remand resolution of whether the
terms of the parties' agreement required such
conduct on the part of the Cleggs.

<P20>[&para;1] Ramel L. Sheppard appeals from a
judgment of conviction for domestic violence
aggravated assault (Class B), 17-A
M.R.S. &sect; 208-D(1)(A) (2020),<fnr1> entered by
the trial court (Androscoggin County,
<EM>Stewart, J.</EM>) following a jury trial at which
the victim did not testify. Sheppard contends
that the court abused its discretion
when it admitted in evidence as an excited
utterance the victim's hearsay statement
identifying him as her attacker, and erred
in determining that the statement was
nontestimonial and that its admission did
not violate the Confrontation Clause of the
United States Constitution, U.S. Const.
amend. VI. We disagree and affirm the
judgment.

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<HN00><EMB>A. Facts</EMB>

<P20>[&para;2] Viewing the evidence admitted at
trial in the light most favorable to its
verdict, the jury could rationally have
found the following facts. <EM>See State v. Healey,</EM>
2024 ME 4, &para; 2, 307 A.3d 1082. On
June 3, 2020, Officer Spencer Simoneau of
the Lewiston Police Department was on
routine patrol. At about 6:00 a.m. he saw
the victim walking near the corner of Bartlett
Street and Walnut Street "appear[ing]
to be distressed." Simoneau saw that the
victim looked like she had been crying and
that "something was wrong with her face."
When he stopped and went to talk to her,
the first thing she said to him was that
"her boyfriend, Ramel Sheppard, had beat
her up." Simoneau was then able to see
that the victim's face was swollen; she was
bleeding; and she had tears coming out of
her eyes, one of which was "crooked" and
not tracking equally.

<P20>[&para;3] The victim did not want to talk to
the officer roadside. She said that "she was
scared and that she couldn't be seen with
[him] on the side of the road." She accepted
a ride to the hospital, where Simoneau
photographed her injuries and called the
Department's domestic violence investigator.
Based on information relayed by Simoneau,
Sheppard was arrested at a residence
on Oak Street; the arresting officer
saw what appeared to be "relatively fresh
blood" on the floor near the door.

<P20>[&para;4] The victim arrived at the hospital at
about 6:10 a.m. She told an emergency
room nurse that "her boyfriend had assaulted
her about 45 minutes before [she
arrived at the emergency room], striking
her in the face and head with his hands
and fists." In making that report, the victim
was "upset," "teary," and seemed
"overwhelmed." The nurse observed that
the "right side of [the victim's] face was
quite swollen," especially her right eye,
which "was looking up and out instead of
forward." The victim also had dried blood
around her nose. The Lewiston Police Department's
domestic violence investigator
came to the hospital and talked to the
<Page 1147>
victim for several hours; during that time
the investigator observed that the appearance
of the victim's facial injuries seemed
to be worsening.

<HN00><EMB>B. Procedure</EMB>

<P20>[&para;5] Sheppard was indicted for domestic
violence aggravated assault (Class B), 17-A
M.R.S. &sect; 208-D(1)(D) (Count 1); domestic
violence assault (Class D), 17-A M.R.S.
&sect; 207-A(1)(A) (2020)<fnr2> (Counts 2 and 4); and
domestic violence aggravated assault
(Class B), 17-A M.R.S. &sect; 208-D(1)(A)
(Count 3).

<P20>[&para;6] The court held a jury trial on October
19 and 20, 2022. At the beginning of
the trial, the State dismissed Count 1.
After the State rested its case-in-chief, the
court granted Sheppard's motion for a
judgment of acquittal on Count 2. The jury
returned verdicts of guilty on Counts 3
and 4.

<P20>[&para;7] At the sentencing hearing, the court
merged Count 4 into Count 3 and dismissed
Count 4 without prejudice. The
court entered judgment on Count 3 and
sentenced Sheppard to seven years' imprisonment,
with all but forty months suspended,
and three years of probation.
Sheppard timely appealed. M.R. App. P.
2B(b)(1).

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<HN00><EMB>A. Excited Utterance</EMB>

<P20>[&para;8] At the outset of the trial, Sheppard
moved in limine to exclude the victim's
hearsay statement to Simoneau that she
had been assaulted by "her boyfriend, Ramel
Sheppard," arguing that it did not
qualify under the excited utterance exception
to the hearsay rule.<fnr3> <EM>See</EM> M.R. Evid.
803(2). That exception provides that "[a]
statement relating to a startling event or
condition, made while the declarant was
under the stress of excitement that it
caused," is "not excluded by the rule
against hearsay." <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>[&para;9] On voir dire examination, Simoneau
said that just before 6:00 a.m. on June 3,
2020, he made contact with the victim on
Bartlett Street in Lewiston. Concerning
that encounter, Simoneau testified:

<B22>PROSECUTOR: [D]id [the victim] flag
you down, [or] did you stop on your
own?

<B22>SIMONEAU: I just happened to see her
out of the corner of my eye. She was
walking. She just seemed distressed and
I could tell something was wrong with
her face, so I just stopped and talked to
her.

<B22>Q: When you stopped to speak with her,
what was her demeanor like?

<B22>A: She was really upset, crying ... I
couldn't tell if [she] was crying because
she was bleeding, her face was swollen.

<B22>Q: She was actively bleeding at the time
that you made contact with her?

<B22>A: Yes, she was.

<B22>Q: Prior to asking her any questions
about her injuries, did she make statements
to you?

<B22>A: Yes.

<B22>Q: What did she say?

<B22>A: She said that her boyfriend, Ramel
Sheppard, had assaulted her.

<B22>Q: Specifically at this time she said that
he beat her up?

<B22>A: Yes.

<B22>Q: How quickly into your interaction
with her was it that this happened, that
she said that?
<Page 1148>

<B22>A: Basically as soon as I got out of the
car.

<B22>Q: Was she still crying and upset at the
time she said that to you?

<B22>A: Yes.

<B22>Q: Still actively bleeding from her face?

<B22>A: Yes.

<B22>....

<B22>DEFENSE COUNSEL: ... You indicate
in your report, I stopped and I
spoke to her, and then you said, while
speaking to her [I] made observations.
What was your conversation about when
you said you spoke to her?

<B22>A: Just like I said, when she said that
she had been assaulted and then she
said that she didn't want to talk to me
right there, she was scared, and I offered
to bring her to the hospital so we
could talk more.

<B22>....

<B22>Q: ... She was able to respond to your
questions, correct?

<B22>A: I&mdash;I didn't really ask her any questions.

<B22>....

<B22>THE COURT: [Y]ou drove past her?

<B22>A: Yeah. Well, I could just see her kind
of&mdash;there's like an open field. I can just
kind of see her. As I drove, I just pulled
up past her, stopped the car.

<B22>....

<B22>Q: So from the moment you saw her
until getting out of the car without being
face to face, how much time elapsed?

<B22>A: Maybe ten seconds.

<B22>Q: So you were able to stop immediately?

<B22>A: Yeah.... She like kind of walked
towards me, towards my car. I got out.

<B22>....

<B22>Q: [W]here was she looking as she's
walking ...?

<B22>A: Just straight ahead....

<B22>Q: She wasn't ... looking towards you?

<B22>A: No.

<B22>Q: Did it look like she was searching you
down or searching an officer down, or
was she just walking in this state [of
distress]?

<B22>A: She was just walking.

<P20>[&para;10] The domestic violence investigator
testified on voir dire about her conversation
with the victim at the hospital. The
victim told the investigator that after leaving
the scene of the assault she had walked
to a friend's house about a half mile away,
stopping briefly to get some money without
going inside, and then had continued
walking a short distance when she encountered
Simoneau about twenty minutes after
the assault.

<P20>[&para;11] Ruling on Sheppard's motion, the
court made factual findings in determining
that the victim's statement qualified as an
excited utterance:

<B22>[T]he court can find that ... the moment
[Simoneau] first saw [the victim]
roughly 40 to 50 feet away from him he
observed [her] walking, sort of looking
not towards him but in a different direction
.... [S]he at that time had not
seen the officer and [the] moment he
saw her she was upset&mdash;in obvious distress,
crying. He could tell something
was wrong with her face. Her nose was
running.

<B42>... [H]e stops almost immediately.
He said it might have been ten seconds
from his first sighting of her [until] he's
actually ... face to face. That ten seconds
involved him simply stopping the
car ... [and] getting out of the car and
in that period from when he first saw
her to when he encountered her, [the
victim] had continued walking up towards
the corner of the street. Upon
getting ... face-to-face, he could see
that she was at that time actively bleeding.

<B42>... And it was immediately upon confronting
her that she made the statement
<Page 1149>
that she had been assaulted by her
boyfriend, Ramel Sheppard....

<B42>... [A]pproximately 20 minutes
elapsed from the moment that [the victim]
indicates she had been assaulted to
[when] an encounter with Officer Simoneau
occurred.

<B44>....

<B42>The amount of time that passed ... is
20 minutes.

<B44>....

<B42>... [Concerning] the nature of the
[victim's] statement. I will say it was a
spontaneous statement in the sense of
when she first encountered the officer, it
was spontaneous. It's the first thing that
she said.

<B42>... [The victim's] physical and emotional
condition all point [to a finding]
that she is under stress, again, those
findings being that she was in obvious
distress, crying, nose is running, apparent
injury with some active bleeding still
occurring.

<B42>... [O]n [the] issue of whether she
had an opportunity for reflection and
fabrication, ... in a normal situation
while walking for 20 minutes there
might be time for that reflection but in
this case what we have is that [in] that
moment that the officer ... first sees
her&mdash;and there's no evidence to suggest
that she had already seen the officer&mdash;
she is already [showing] this indicia of
distress....

<B42>And ten seconds&mdash;assuming she even
saw the officer then, we don't know exactly,
assuming it was something less
than ten seconds, I don't feel that it was
[enough] time for her to reflect about
I'm now seeing an officer so I better get
my story straight.

<B44>....

<B42>... [A]gain, the facts of this case, how
quickly it was from the officer making
the spontaneous observation of her being
in distress, her not knowing the
officer was there, I don't believe there
was time for her to reflect and fabricate.

<B44>....

<B42>... [T]here was a startling event, and
I'm finding that [the victim's] statement
... was spontaneous and unreflecting in
the sense of her not knowing she was
about to encounter an officer and it
[was] something that she immediately
says with all [of] the other observations
that have been made.

<B42>So I am finding that that statement
will meet [the requirements for] the exception
[as an] excited utterance.<fnr4>

<P20>[&para;12] We have said that "[a] court may
admit a hearsay statement pursuant to the
excited utterance exception if it finds the
following foundational elements: (1) a startling
event occurred; (2) the hearsay statement
related to the startling event; and (3)
the hearsay statement was made while the
declarant was under the stress of excitement
caused by that event." <EM>State v. Curtis,</EM>
2019 ME 100, &para; 30, 210 A.3d 834
(quotation marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;13] Sheppard does not challenge the
court's finding that the first and second
elements were satisfied. Rather, he contends
that the third element&mdash;requiring
that the victim's statement have been
made while she was under the stress of
excitement caused by the assault&mdash;was
not. <EM>See id.</EM>; M.R. Evid. 803(2).

<P20>[&para;14] "We review the court's
foundational findings or implicit findings to
support admissibility of evidence for clear
error, and will uphold those findings unless
no competent evidence supports them."
<EM>Curtis,</EM> 2019 ME 100, &para; 30, 210 A.3d 834
<Page 1150>
(alteration and quotation marks omitted).
We review for an abuse of discretion the
court's ultimate decision to admit the hearsay
statement. <EM>State v. Sykes,</EM> 2019 ME 43,
&para; 15, 204 A.3d 1282. The trial court's factual
findings here are well-supported by the
record.<fnr5>

<P20>[&para;15] In applying those findings to
the applicable test,

<B22>[w]e have held that there is no bright
line time limit to use in deciding when
the stress of excitement caused by a
startling event has dissipated. Rather, a
court must consider a variety of factors,
including the nature of the startling or
stressful event, the amount of time that
passed between the startling event and
the statement, the declarant's opportunity
or capacity for reflection or fabrication
during that time, the nature of the
statement itself, and the declarant's
physical and emotional condition at the
time of the statement.

<P00><EM>Curtis,</EM> 2019 ME 100, &para; 33, 210 A.3d 834
(alteration, citation, and quotation marks
omitted).

<P20>[&para;16] Here, the victim made her
spontaneous statement, which directly concerned
a very serious event that by its
nature was both startling and stressful,
about twenty minutes after it occurred. At
that time her physical and emotional condition
were such that the officer felt compelled
to stop and investigate even though
the victim was simply walking along a
public street. She had no time to reflect on
or fabricate the statement because it was
made to a police officer whom she did not
summon, and did not know was coming,
within ten seconds of his appearance.

<P20>[&para;17] Contrary to Sheppard's chief contention,
the twenty-minute interval between
the assault and the victim's statement
is not, given the other factors found
by the court, dispositive of whether she
had an opportunity to fabricate the statement.
As Sheppard concedes, in <EM>Curtis</EM> we
affirmed the trial court's finding that a
statement made "within 20 minutes" following
an assault qualified as an excited
utterance. <EM>Id.</EM> &para;&para; 34, 37.

<P20>[&para;18] On this record, we have no difficulty
in concluding that the trial court did not
clearly err in finding that the victim remained
under the stress of excitement
caused by Sheppard's assault when she
made the statement to Simoneau identifying
Sheppard as her attacker, and thus did
not abuse its discretion in admitting the
statement as an excited utterance. <EM>See id.</EM>
&para; 37; <EM>Sykes,</EM> 2019 ME 43, &para; 15, 204 A.3d
1282.

<HN00><EMB>B. Confrontation</EMB>

<P20>[&para;19] Sheppard also contends
that the admission of the victim's statement
identifying him as her assailant violated
his constitutional right to confront
her at trial.<fnr6> "[S]tatements that are admissible
pursuant to the rules of evidence&mdash;
<Page 1151>
such as the [excited utterance] exception
at issue here&mdash;may be inadmissible when
tested against the Confrontation Clause."
<EM>State v. Adams,</EM> 2019 ME 132, &para; 20, 214
A.3d 496 (quotation marks omitted). We
have recognized that

<B22>[t]he federal Confrontation Clause,
which applies to the states through the
Fourteenth Amendment, provides that
"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused
shall enjoy the right ... to be
confronted with the witnesses against
him." U.S. Const. amend. VI. Article I,
section 6 of the Maine Constitution provides
similarly that "[i]n all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall have a
right ... [t]o be confronted by the witnesses
against the accused." Even if an
out-of-court statement is admissible pursuant
to an exception to the hearsay
rule, these constitutional provisions bar
the admission of <EM>testimonial</EM> statements
of a witness who did not appear at trial
unless he [or she] was unavailable to
testify, and the defendant had had a
prior opportunity for cross-examination.
<EM>Nontestimonial</EM> statements, on the other
hand, do not trigger the protections of
the Confrontation Clause.

<P00><EM>Sykes,</EM> 2019 ME 43, &para; 24, 204 A.3d 1282
(citations and quotation marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;20] The trial court's "legal conclusions
that certain statements are non-testimonial,
and therefore admissible over
Confrontation Clause objections, are reviewed
de novo." <EM>State v. Kimball,</EM> 2015
ME 67, &para; 14, 117 A.3d 585; <EM>see Adams,</EM>
2019 ME 132, &para; 19, 214 A.3d 496. Here the
court found:

<B22>In this case it's clearly not an interrogation
because the evidence presented ...
is that ... the officer had not even
asked a question.... That by itself
doesn't make [the victim's statement]
non-testimonial, but ... I've already
made ... findings this was a spontaneous
statement made by the declarant
when she first encountered the officer
... [the victim] wasn't expecting [him],
she wasn't looking [for him], ... nor was
there evidence that she was trying to
flee or evade the officer, [it was a] spontaneous
statement that she made to him
in the first encounter in the condition
[she was in] so I'm making a finding that
it's not a testimonial statement for confrontation[]
purposes, so the statement
will be admissible.

<P00>We conclude that the court's determination
that the victim's statement was nontestimonial,
and thus admissible, was correct.

<P20>[&para;21] "[W]hether [a statement] is
testimonial and thus barred by the Confrontation
Clause ... is necessarily a fact-specific
inquiry." <EM>State v. Metzger,</EM> 2010
ME 67, &para; 22, 999 A.2d 947. The Supreme
Court has recognized that a volunteered
statement may be testimonial. <EM>See Melendez-Diaz
v. Massachusetts,</EM> 557 U.S. 305,
316, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314
(2009). That said, the circumstances here,
where the victim, still suffering from the
immediate aftereffects of being beaten,
made her spontaneous statement to Officer
Simoneau within ten seconds of becoming
aware that he was present and before he
could ask a single question, are, in our
view, ultimately dispositive.

<HN24><EMB>1.</EMB> <EMBI>Crawford v. Washington</EMBI> <EMB>and</EMB> <EMBI>State
v. Barnes</EMBI>

<P20>[&para;22] Shortly after the Supreme Court
handed down its seminal decision in <EM>Crawford
v. Washington,</EM> 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct.
1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), in which the
Court held that the admission of testimonial
hearsay violates the Confrontation
Clause absent a prior opportunity for
cross-examination, <EM>id.</EM> at 68-69, 124 S.Ct.
1354, we decided a case where a murder
victim had, more than a year before her
death, driven herself to a police station
"sobbing and crying ... and ... said that
<Page 1152>
her son had assaulted her and had threatened
to kill her." <EM>State v. Barnes,</EM> 2004 ME
105, &para;&para; 2-3, 854 A.2d 208. Holding that the
victim's statement was nontestimonial, we
said that

<B22>[a] number of factors support this determination.
First, the police did not seek
her out. She went to the police station
on her own, not at the demand or request
of the police. Second, her statements
to them were made when she was
still under the stress of the alleged assault.
Any questions posed to her by the
police were presented in the context of
determining why she was distressed.
Third, she was not responding to tactically
structured police questioning as in
<EM>Crawford,</EM> but was instead seeking safety
and aid. The police were not questioning
her regarding known criminal
activity and did not have reason, until
her own statements were made, to believe
that a person or persons had been
involved in any specific wrongdoing.
Considering all of these facts in their
context, we conclude that interaction between
Barnes's mother and the officer
was not structured police interrogation
triggering the cross-examination requirement
of the Confrontation Clause
as interpreted by the Court in <EM>Crawford.</EM>

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> &para; 11.

<P20>[&para;23] Our analysis then is relevant now.
Here, the police did not seek out the victim.
Her statement was made while she
was still under the stress of the assault.
Simoneau asked no questions to prompt
the statement&mdash;thus no "tactically structured
police questioning" was involved&mdash;and
his contact with the victim occurred
only in the context of determining why she
was distressed. Applying our analysis in
<EM>Barnes</EM> results in the same conclusion
reached by the trial court&mdash;the victim's
statement was nontestimonial and therefore
admissible.

<P20>[&para;24] Not surprisingly, there have been
cases decided since <EM>Barnes</EM> and <EM>Crawford</EM>
in which we and the Supreme Court have
explored the testimonial versus nontestimonial
distinction and the circumstances
that result in a hearsay statement falling
into one category or the other. We now
turn to a review of particularly significant
decisions and their effect on our analysis.

<HN24><EMB>2.</EMB> <EMBI>Davis v. Washington</EMBI>

<P20>[&para;25] In <EM>Davis v. Washington,</EM> when considering
the admissibility of a 9-1-1 recording
in which the victim identified her assailant,
the Supreme Court set out a basic
test:

<B42>Without attempting to produce an exhaustive
classification of all conceivable
statements&mdash;or even all conceivable
statements in response to police interrogation&mdash;as
either testimonial or nontestimonial,
it suffices to decide the present
cases to hold as follows: Statements are
nontestimonial when made in the course
of police interrogation under circumstances
objectively indicating that the
primary purpose of the interrogation is
to enable police assistance to meet an
ongoing emergency. They are testimonial
when the circumstances objectively
indicate that there is no such ongoing
emergency, and that the primary purpose
of the interrogation is to establish
or prove past events potentially relevant
to later criminal prosecution.

<P00>547 U.S. 813, 817-18, 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266,
165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006). The <EM>Davis</EM> Court
explained the nuances of the "primary purpose"
test in emphasizing that

<B22>in <EM>Crawford,</EM> ... we had immediately in
mind ... interrogations solely directed
at establishing the facts of a past crime,
in order to identify (or provide evidence
to convict) the perpetrator.... A 911
call, on the other hand, and at least the
initial interrogation conducted in connection
<Page 1153>
with a 911 call, is ordinarily not
designed primarily to establish or prove
some past fact, but to describe current
circumstances requiring police assistance.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 826-27, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (alterations,
citations, and quotation marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;26] The Court also stressed the significance
of the particular circumstances of
the case being reviewed:

<B22>[T]he difference in the level of formality
between the two interviews [in <EM>Crawford</EM>
and <EM>Davis</EM>] is striking. Crawford was
responding calmly, at the station house,
to a series of questions, with the officer-interrogator
taping and making notes of
her answers; [the <EM>Davis</EM> victim's] frantic
answers were provided over the phone,
in an environment that was not tranquil,
or even ... safe.

<B42>We conclude from all this that the
circumstances of [the <EM>Davis</EM> victim's] interrogation
objectively indicate its primary
purpose was to enable police assistance
to meet an ongoing emergency.
She simply was not acting as a <EM>witness</EM>;
she was not <EM>testifying.</EM> What she said
was not a weaker substitute for live
testimony at trial....

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 827-28, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (quotation
marks omitted).

<P20>[&para;27] Here, applying the holding of
<EM>Davis,</EM> the trial court was justified in finding
that Sheppard's victim made her unprompted,
spontaneous roadside statement
"to enable police assistance to meet an
ongoing emergency"&mdash;the emergency being
that she had been severely beaten by
her boyfriend only twenty minutes earlier
and her injuries were continuing to worsen&mdash;and
not to act as evidence in a potential
future prosecution of the perpetrator.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 828, 126 S.Ct. 2266. Unlike in
the case of a 9-1-1 call, the victim here did
not <EM>initiate</EM> contact with police&mdash;quite to
the contrary, she did not know she was
going to have contact with a police officer
until Simoneau's sudden appearance in
front of her. The <EM>Davis</EM> Court anticipated
just such a circumstance when it noted
that in a domestic violence context, "officers
called to investigate need to know
whom they are dealing with in order to
assess the situation, the threat to their
own safety, and possible danger to the
potential victim. Such exigencies may <EM>often</EM>
mean that initial inquiries produce
nontestimonial statements." <EM>Id.</EM> at 831, 126
S.Ct. 2266 (alterations, citation, and quotation
marks omitted).

<HN24><EMB>3.</EMB> <EMBI>Michigan v. Bryant</EMBI>

<P20>[&para;28] Five years after deciding <EM>Davis,</EM>
the Supreme Court further refined what is
meant by "an ongoing emergency" when it
considered a case where police found a
gunshot victim on the ground about twenty-five
minutes after the shooting, asked
him "what had happened, who had shot
him, and where the shooting had occurred,"
and received answers that were
later admitted at the defendant's trial.
<EM>Michigan v. Bryant,</EM> 562 U.S. 344, 349-50,
377, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 179 L.Ed.2d 93 (2011)
(quotation marks omitted). In holding that
the statements were nontestimonial, the
Court explained that

<B22>[t]he basic purpose of the Confrontation
Clause was to target the sort of abuses
exemplified at the notorious treason trial
of Sir Walter Raleigh. Thus, the most
important instances in which the Clause
restricts the introduction of out-of-court
statements are those in which state actors
are involved in a formal, out-of-court
interrogation of a witness to obtain
evidence for trial.... When, as in
<EM>Davis,</EM> the primary purpose of an interrogation
is to respond to an ongoing
emergency, its purpose is not to create a
record for trial and thus is not within
the scope of the Clause.
<Page 1154>

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 357-58, 131 S.Ct. 1143 (alteration,
citation, footnote, and quotation marks
omitted). Important to the present case,
the Court's analysis went further:

<B22>But there may be <EM>other</EM> circumstances,
aside from ongoing emergencies, when a
statement is not procured with a primary
purpose of creating an out-of-court
substitute for trial testimony. In making
the primary purpose determination,
standard rules of hearsay, designed to
identify some statements as reliable, will
be relevant. Where no such primary
purpose exists, the admissibility of a
statement is the concern of state and
federal rules of evidence, not the Confrontation
Clause.

<B42>... [The] context [of this case] requires
us to provide additional clarification
with regard to what <EM>Davis</EM> meant by
"the primary purpose of the interrogation
is to enable police assistance to
meet an ongoing emergency."[<fnr7>]

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 358-59, 131 S.Ct. 1143 (quoting
<EM>Davis,</EM> 547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266).

<P20>[&para;29] The Court said that determining
the "primary purpose" of a challenged
statement in a given case requires

<B22>[a]n objective analysis of the circumstances
of an encounter and the statements
and actions of the parties to it[,
which] provides the most accurate assessment
of the "primary purpose of the
interrogation." The circumstances in
which an encounter occurs ... are clearly
matters of objective fact. The statements
and actions of the parties must
also be objectively evaluated. That is,
the relevant inquiry is not the subjective
or actual purpose of the individuals involved
in a particular encounter, but
rather the purpose that reasonable participants
would have had, as ascertained
from the individual's statements and actions
and the circumstances in which the
encounter occurred.

<B44>....

<B42>This logic is not unlike that justifying
the excited utterance exception in hearsay
law.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 360-61, 131 S.Ct. 1143 (footnote
omitted).

<P20>[&para;30] In applying this test, the
Court explained, it is wrong to "erroneously
read <EM>Davis</EM> as deciding that ... statements
made after the defendant stopped
assaulting the victim and left the premises
did <EM>not</EM> occur during an ongoing emergency.
... [Rather,] whether an emergency
exists and is ongoing is a highly context-dependent
inquiry." <EM>Id.</EM> at 363, 131 S.Ct.
1143 (quotation marks omitted). Indeed,
"whether an ongoing emergency exists is
<EM>simply one factor</EM>&mdash;albeit an important
factor&mdash;that informs the ultimate inquiry
regarding the `primary purpose' of an interrogation."
<EM>Id.</EM> at 366, 131 S.Ct. 1143
(emphasis added).

<P20>[&para;31] We do not make the analytical
error identified by the Court. Viewing
these facts objectively, as we have explained,
leads us to conclude that the victim's
primary purpose in making her spontaneous
statement identifying Sheppard as
her attacker was to resolve what the
<EM>Bryant</EM> Court held may be included in the
category of "an ongoing emergency."

<P20>[&para;32] Our conclusion is further
supported by the <EM>Bryant</EM> Court's discussion
of additional factors relevant to the
"primary purpose" analysis. One such factor
is "[t]he medical condition of the victim[,
which] is important to the primary
purpose inquiry to the extent that it sheds
<Page 1155>
light on the ability of the victim to have
any purpose at all in responding to police
questions and on the likelihood that any
purpose formed would necessarily be a
testimonial one." <EM>Id.</EM> at 364-65, 131 S.Ct.
1143; <EM>see id.</EM> at 375, 131 S.Ct. 1143. Here,
the trial court found that the victim was
still crying and bleeding, with her face
swelling and her eye significantly injured,
when she encountered Simoneau. We think
it highly unlikely that in her physical and
emotional condition the victim was able to
formulate a plan to incriminate Sheppard
and have him prosecuted in the fleeting
ten-second interval between Simoneau's
appearance and her unsolicited statement
to the officer.

<P20>[&para;33] The dissent's analysis suggests
the existence of a bright-line rule
inexorably leading to a conclusion that under
defined circumstances "a declarant <EM>can
only have had</EM> a significant appreciation
that the information would be used to investigate
and prosecute the person she
accused."<fnr8> Dissenting Opinion &para; 76 (emphasis
added). We disagree with that notion.
Each case requires a review of its
unique facts and circumstances, followed
by an objective, but flexible, evaluation as
to whether a challenged statement was
testimonial for purposes of the Confrontation
Clause.

<P20>[&para;34] Another relevant factor to a
primary purpose analysis is "the importance
of <EM>informality</EM> in an encounter between
a victim and police." <EM>Bryant,</EM> 562
U.S. at 366, 131 S.Ct. 1143; <EM>see id.</EM> at 377,
131 S.Ct. 1143; <EM>id.</EM> at 378, 131 S.Ct. 1143
(Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment)
("[The victim's] questioning by police
lacked sufficient formality and solemnity
for his statements to be considered `testimonial.'").
In <EM>Bryant,</EM> "the questioning ...
occurred in an exposed, public area, prior
to the arrival of emergency medical services,
and in a disorganized fashion. All of
those facts make [a] case distinguishable
from the formal station-house interrogation
in <EM>Crawford.</EM>" <EM>Id.</EM> at 366, 131 S.Ct.
1143. Precisely the same circumstances are
found in the situation we consider here.

<P20>[&para;35] Further,

<B22>[v]ictims are ... likely to have mixed
motives when they make statements to
the police. During an ongoing emergency,
a victim is most likely to want the
threat to her ... to end, but that does
not necessarily mean that the victim
wants or envisions prosecution of the
assailant. A victim may want the attacker
to be incapacitated temporarily or
rehabilitated. Alternatively, a severely
injured victim may have no purpose at
all in answering questions posed; the
answers may be simply reflexive. The
victim's injuries could be so debilitating
as to prevent her from thinking sufficiently
clearly to understand whether
her statements are for the purpose of
addressing an ongoing emergency or for
the purpose of future prosecution. Taking
into account a victim's injuries does
not transform this objective inquiry into
a subjective one. The inquiry is still
objective because it focuses on the understanding
and purpose of a reasonable
victim in the circumstances of the actual
<Page 1156>
victim&mdash;circumstances that prominently
include the victim's physical state.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 368-69, 131 S.Ct. 1143 (footnote
omitted).

<P20>[&para;36] Here, the victim did not want to
immediately give Simoneau all of the details
of the assault beyond initially&mdash;and
likely reflexively, given the ten seconds
she had to consider her statement&mdash;telling
him why she was in the state she was in.
Her primary concern was that she not be
seen talking to the police on the side of the
road. One could presume that if the victim
had as her primary purpose a desire to
have Sheppard arrested and prosecuted,
she would have, at the first opportunity,
given the officer all of the details needed
to make sure that happened.

<P20>[&para;37] In sum, as the Court explained in
<EM>Bryant,</EM> in this case, "[b]ecause the circumstances
of the encounter as well as the
statements and actions of [the victim] and
the police objectively indicate that the primary
purpose of the [victim's statement]
was to enable police assistance to meet an
ongoing emergency, [the victim's] identification
... of [her attacker] ... [was] not
testimonial hearsay. The Confrontation
Clause did not bar [its] admission at
[Sheppard's] trial." <EM>Id.</EM> at 377-78, 131 S.Ct.
1143 (citation and quotation marks omitted).

<HN24><EMB>4.</EMB> <EMBI>Ohio v. Clark</EMBI>

<P20>[&para;38] Four years after deciding <EM>Bryant,</EM>
the Court restated the principles set out in
that case and summarized them thusly:
"[U]nder our precedents, a statement cannot
fall within the Confrontation Clause
unless its primary purpose was testimonial.
Where no such primary purpose exists,
the admissibility of a statement is the concern
of state and federal rules of evidence,
not the Confrontation Clause." <EM>Ohio v.
Clark,</EM> 576 U.S. 237, 245, 135 S.Ct. 2173,
192 L.Ed.2d 306 (2015) (quotation marks
omitted).

<HN24><EMB>5. Maine decisions</EMB>

<P20>[&para;39] Following <EM>Barnes,</EM> we decided several
cases reaching the issue of whether a
challenged statement is testimonial or non-testimonial.
Among those relevant here are

<B24>&bull; <EM>State v. Adams,</EM> where we noted that
"[f]or purposes of the Confrontation
Clause, testimonial statements are
out-of-court statements made <EM>primarily</EM>
to establish or prove past
events potentially relevant to later
criminal prosecution." 2019 ME 132,
&para; 20 n.8, 214 A.3d 496 (emphasis
added) (quotation marks omitted).

<B24>&bull; <EM>State v. Kimball,</EM> where we recognized
that whether a statement is
testimonial is "necessarily a fact-specific
inquiry" and said that "[a]n `ongoing
emergency' is by its nature
broader than the attack itself; it includes
the victim's untreated injuries,
the ongoing stress of the event,
and the possibility that the assailant
is still at large and could attack the
victim again." 2015 ME 67, &para;&para; 18, 25,
117 A.3d 585 (quotation marks omitted).

<B24>&bull; <EM>State v. Williams,</EM> where we said:
"An out-of-court statement is testimonial
when it is a solemn declaration
or affirmation made for the purpose
of establishing or proving some
fact. If a statement was made under
circumstances that would lead an objective
witness reasonably to believe
that the statement would be available
for use at a later trial, then the
statement is testimonial for the purposes
of the Confrontation Clause."
2012 ME 63, &para; 27, 52 A.3d 911 (citation
and quotation marks omitted).

<HN24><EMB>6. Conclusion</EMB>

<P20>[&para;40] Applying the decisions of the Supreme
Court in <EM>Crawford, Davis, Bryant,</EM>
and <EM>Clark,</EM> and our decisions reached in
light of that case law, to the facts found
<Page 1157>
by the trial court, we conclude that the
victim's statement to Officer Simoneau&mdash;
made spontaneously and reflexively, without
any opportunity for reflection or fabrication,
and while coping with recent injuries
&mdash;was not made for the primary
purpose of giving evidence against Sheppard,
but rather for the purpose of resolving
a current and ongoing emergency.
Accordingly, the statement was nontestimonial
and the trial court did not err in
admitting it in evidence.

<P20>The entry is:

<P20>Judgment affirmed.
[DJ]
<P20><author>HJELM</author>, <dgn>A.R.J.</dgn>, dissenting.
[DT]
<P20>[&para;41] "[My] boyfriend, Ramel Sheppard[,]
... assaulted [me]."

<P20>[&para;42] That accusation&mdash;made to a police
officer, without prompting, and after the
emergency surrounding the assault had
subsided&mdash;is a "testimonial" statement as
measured by the principles of constitutional
confrontation protections. I agree that
the trial court did not exceed the breadth
of its discretion by determining, after the
declarant did not appear for trial, that the
admission of her extrajudicial statement in
evidence was not barred by hearsay rules.
When, however, the court also determined
that Sheppard's constitutional right to confront
that accuser would not be violated if
the evidence were admitted, the court
erred. For that reason, I respectfully dissent
from the Court's conclusion to the
contrary.

<P20>[&para;43] In this separate opinion, I will first
discuss the law of confrontation rights germane
to this case (Part I). Then, after
touching on the standard of review governing
this appeal (Part II(A)), I will explain
the reasons why, in my view, the declarant's
statement was inadmissible as a constitutional
matter because that evidence
could properly be presented to the jury
only if she had appeared in court to testify
and the defendant, Ramel Sheppard, had
the opportunity to cross-examine her
(Parts II(B)(1) and (2)).

<CN><EMB>I. THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT
TO CONFRONT WITNESSES</EMB>

<P20>[&para;44] As one component of the Sixth
Amendment, the Confrontation Clause ensures
that "[i]n all criminal prosecutions,
the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be
confronted with the witnesses against
him." U.S. Const. amend. VI. This federal
protection governs proceedings in state
courts, <EM>Pointer v. Texas,</EM> 380 U.S. 400, 403,
85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965), and
has been applied by Maine's courts for
more than half a century, <EM>see, e.g., Cote v.
State,</EM> 286 A.2d 868, 873 (Me. 1972).<fnr9> For
years, the federally-based right of confrontation
was closely aligned with the rules of
evidence. Pursuant to that approach, admission
of an out-of-court statement would
not be barred by the Confrontation Clause,
even when the declarant was unavailable
to testify at trial, so long as the statement
carried "adequate `indicia of reliability'"&mdash;
meaning that the statement fell within "a
firmly rooted hearsay exception" or was
otherwise supported by "particularized
guarantees of trustworthiness." <EM>Ohio v.
Roberts,</EM> 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65
L.Ed.2d 597 (1980).<fnr10>
<Page 1158>

<P20>[&para;45] The jurisprudential landscape governing
confrontation rights was changed
fundamentally with the landmark decision
of <EM>Crawford v. Washington,</EM> 541 U.S. 36,
124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).
There, the Supreme Court of the United
States repudiated the standard it had announced
in <EM>Roberts</EM> and imposed a new test
to determine when the Confrontation
Clause bars the admission of evidence of
an extrajudicial statement made by a declarant
who did not appear at trial and
whom the accused had not had an opportunity
to cross-examine. <EM>Id.</EM> at 50-65, 124
S.Ct. 1354. The new test arises from the
language of the Constitution itself&mdash;that
the right of confrontation arises when the
declarant is a "witness[]." <EM>Id.</EM> at 51, 124
S.Ct. 1354 (quotation marks omitted).
From that starting point, the Court invoked
a formula: a "witness" is someone
who "bear[s] testimony," and "testimony"
is "typically a solemn declaration or affirmation
made for the purpose of establishing
or proving some fact." <EM>Id.</EM> (quotation
marks and alteration omitted).

<P20>[&para;46] In overruling <EM>Roberts,</EM> the <EM>Crawford</EM>
Court made explicit that the abuses
remedied by the Confrontation Clause are
unrelated to any conception that the right
was designed merely to exclude unreliable
evidence, which instead is the point of the
hearsay rules. <EM>Id.</EM> at 59-65, 124 S.Ct. 1354;
<EM>see supra</EM> n.10. As the Court put it, "we
do not think the Framers meant to leave
the Sixth Amendment's protection to the
vagaries of the rules of evidence, much
less to amorphous notions of `reliability.'"
<EM>Crawford,</EM> 541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. 1354.
Rather, the constitutional inquiry is qualitatively
different from any determination
of admissibility pursuant to the rules of
evidence because the former is grounded,
not in a court's administrative rules, but
instead in an historical understanding of
the reasons why the constitutional protection
arose. <EM>Id.</EM> at 42-59, 124 S.Ct. 1354. At
bottom, irrespective of any determination
that the evidence is reliable, admission of
evidence of an out-of-court statement is
barred by the Confrontation Clause if the
statement is "[t]estimonial," the declarant
is unavailable to testify at trial, and the
accused had no prior opportunity to cross-examine
the declarant. <EM>Id.</EM> at 59, 124 S.Ct.
1354.

<P20>[&para;47] Of course, as relevant to this case,
the next question is, What <EM>is</EM> a testimonial
statement? This critical question arises because
if the out-of-court statement is <EM>not</EM>
testimonial, the demands of the right of
confrontation are not implicated. <EM>Crawford</EM>
provides the definition of a testimonial declaration
quoted above and further explains
that the nature of a testimonial statement
is "<EM>ex parte</EM> in-court testimony or its functional
equivalent." <EM>Id.</EM> at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354
(quotation marks omitted). <EM>Crawford</EM> offers
some examples of a "core class" of testimonial
declarations. Those examples include
affidavits, custodial interrogations, and
other prior testimony that was not subject
to cross-examination by the defendant&mdash;
namely, "statements that were made under
circumstances which would lead an objective
witness reasonably to believe that the
statement would be available for use at a
later trial." <EM>Id.</EM> at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. 1354
(quotation marks omitted). The Court
nonetheless approached the issue with
modesty and left "for another day any
effort to spell out a comprehensive definition
<Page 1159>
of `testimonial.'" <EM>Id.</EM> at 68, 124 S.Ct.
1354.

<P20>[&para;48] The Supreme Court's subsequent
decision in <EM>Davis v. Washington,</EM> issued
two years after <EM>Crawford,</EM> took a material
step in that direction by introducing another
characteristic of an out-of-court
statement that would be considered to determine
if it is testimonial. 547 U.S. 813,
126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006).
That characteristic appears to draw on
<EM>Crawford</EM>'s focus on how a person in the
declarant's circumstances would reasonably
expect the statement to be used.
Again making clear that the principle was
not exhaustive, <EM>Davis</EM> delineated testimonial
and nontestimonial statements in the
following way:

<B22>Statements are nontestimonial when
made in the course of police interrogation
under circumstances objectively indicating
that the <EM>primary purpose</EM> of the
interrogation is to enable police assistance
to meet an ongoing emergency.
They are testimonial when the circumstances
objectively indicate that there is
no such ongoing emergency, and that
the <EM>primary purpose</EM> of the interrogation
is to establish or prove past events
potentially relevant to later criminal
prosecution.

<P00><EM>Id.</EM> at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (emphases added).

<P20>[&para;49] <EM>Davis</EM> involved statements made
by a witness to the police during questioning,
so the Court framed the new standard
in a way that presupposes a dialogue. <EM>Id.</EM>
at 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266. Importantly for our
case, however, the Court also clarified that
a statement that was <EM>not</EM> the product of
police interrogation nonetheless could be
testimonial because "[t]he Framers were
no more willing to exempt from cross-examination
volunteered testimony ...
than they were to exempt answers to detailed
interrogation." <EM>Id.</EM> at 822 n.1, 126
S.Ct. 2266; <EM>see Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts,</EM>
557 U.S. 305, 316, 129 S.Ct. 2527,
174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009). Ultimately, the
inquiry focuses on the declarant's statements,
which, after all, would constitute
the evidence, rather than on any questions
that generated the out-of-court statements
&mdash;or on whether there were any
questions at all. <EM>Davis,</EM> 547 U.S. at 822 n.1,
126 S.Ct. 2266.

<P20>[&para;50] The Court's opinion in <EM>Davis</EM> actually
comprised decisions in two separate
cases. In one, the declarant made statements
to an emergency dispatcher about
dangerous events that were happening
contemporaneously. <EM>Id.</EM> at 827, 829, 126
S.Ct. 2266. These were deemed to be non-testimonial
because the statements were
elicited to resolve a present emergency. <EM>Id.</EM>
In the second case, a witness answered
questions posed by investigators about
past events and in a formal setting, after
the underlying emergency had passed. <EM>Id.</EM>
at 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266. The Court concluded
that those statements were testimonial
and therefore constitutionally inadmissible
given that the declarant was not available
to testify at trial and the defendant had
not had a prior opportunity to cross-examine
her. <EM>Id.</EM> at 829-32, 126 S.Ct. 2266.

<P20>[&para;51] The next major jurisprudential development
that is instructive here&mdash;and, in
my view, it is <EM>highly</EM> instructive&mdash;was the
Supreme Court's decision in <EM>Michigan v.
Bryant,</EM> 562 U.S. 344, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 179
L.Ed.2d 93 (2011). There, the Court further
explored the notion of an "ongoing
emergency," which had been identified in
<EM>Davis,</EM> quoted above, as an important circumstance
when determining whether a
statement made in that context is testimonial.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 359, 131 S.Ct. 1143 (quotation
marks omitted). In <EM>Bryant,</EM> the Court reiterated
and emphasized the salience of the
"ongoing emergency" inquiry, calling it
"among the most important circumstances
informing the primary purpose" of the
<Page 1160>
statement. <EM>Id.</EM> at 361, 131 S.Ct. 1143 (quotation
marks omitted); <EM>see also id.</EM> at 366,
370, 131 S.Ct. 1143. The Court enumerated
a series of considerations that bear on the
"primary purpose" of an out-of-court statement
&mdash;whether, as a primary example, the
statement addresses an ongoing emergency
or whether it is more in line with an
effort to provide evidence for a future
prosecution. <EM>Id.</EM> at 358, 131 S.Ct. 1143. In
the end, these factors arise from an understanding
that "the existence and duration
of an emergency depend on the type and
scope of danger posed to the victim, the
police, and the public." <EM>Id.</EM> at 370-71, 131
S.Ct. 1143.

<P20>[&para;52] With the caveat that the determination
of whether an ongoing emergency
exists is "a highly context-dependent inquiry,"
<EM>id.</EM> at 363, 131 S.Ct. 1143, the Court
identified the following considerations:

<B24>&bull; Was the dispute that created the
emergency "purely private," or was
it one that also endangered people in
addition to the original victim, including
the police and the public? <EM>Id.</EM>
at 363, 372-73, 131 S.Ct. 1143. In this
context, the Court observed that
"[d]omestic violence cases ... often
have a narrower zone of potential
victims than cases involving threats
to public safety." <EM>Id.</EM> at 363, 131 S.Ct.
1143.

<B24>&bull; Did the threat or violence involve a
firearm or other dangerous weapon?
<EM>Id.</EM> at 364, 373-74, 131 S.Ct. 1143.
For example, if the assailant acted
without an implement and "was
armed only with his fists," an emergency
may end when the victim is in
a location separate from the perpetrator.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 364, 131 S.Ct. 1143; <EM>see
State v. Judkins,</EM> 2024 ME 45, &para; 17,
319 A.3d 443. But if a gun is involved,
an emergency may endure
well past "the violent act itself."
<EM>Bryant,</EM> 562 U.S. at 374, 131 S.Ct.
1143.

<B24>&bull; What was the perpetrator's motivation
for causing the harm? <EM>Id.</EM> at 372,
374, 377, 131 S.Ct. 1143.

<B24>&bull; What was the declarant's medical
condition when she made the statement?
<EM>Id.</EM> at 364-65, 131 S.Ct. 1143.
This consideration is "important ...
to the extent that it sheds light on
... the likelihood that any purpose
formed would necessarily be a testimonial
one." <EM>Id.</EM> at 365, 131 S.Ct.
1143.

<B24>&bull; Was the statement made in a formal
setting, which is more indicative of a
purpose of developing evidence that
would be used in a later criminal
prosecution? <EM>Id.</EM> at 366, 131 S.Ct.
1143. The Court tempered this point,
however, by cautioning that even
though formality suggests that there
is no ongoing emergency, the converse
may not be true&mdash;"informality
does not necessarily indicate the
presence of an emergency or the lack
of testimonial intent." <EM>Id.</EM> at 366, 131
S.Ct. 1143.

<P20>[&para;53] These and other pertinent circumstances
are to be examined objectively&mdash;
that is, not as an attempt to divine "the
subjective or actual purpose of the individuals
involved in a particular encounter, but
rather the purpose that reasonable participants
would have had, as ascertained from
the individuals' statements and actions and
the circumstances in which the encounter
occurred." <EM>Id.</EM> at 360, 131 S.Ct. 1143.

<P20>[&para;54] With these legal principles in mind,
I now turn to their bearing on the case
before us.

<CN><EMB>II. THE TESTIMONIAL NATURE OF
THE VICTIM'S ACCUSATION</EMB>

<HN00><EMB>A. Standard of Review</EMB>

<P20>[&para;55] Any discussion of the issues on an
appeal first requires consideration of the
<Page 1161>
standard of review. In appeals that have
presented challenges based on the Confrontation
Clause, we have stated that we
will review de novo a trial court's "legal
conclusions that certain statements are
nontestimonial, and therefore admissible
over Confrontation Clause objections."
<EM>State v. Kimball,</EM> 2015 ME 67, &para; 14, 117
A.3d 585; <EM>see Judkins,</EM> 2024 ME 45, &para; 11,
319 A.3d 443 ("We review de novo the
impact of the admission of testimony on
the constitutional right to confront witnesses."
(quotation marks omitted)); <EM>State
v. Sykes,</EM> 2019 ME 43, &para; 15, 204 A.3d 1282
(stating that, when an assertion is made on
appeal of a "constitutional deprivation"
based on the Confrontation Clause, "we
review de novo the court's decision to admit
the evidence"); <EM>see also State v. Johnson,</EM>
2014 ME 83, &para; 8, 95 A.3d 621 ("We
review the application of the Confrontation
Clause de novo."); <EM>State v. Rickett,</EM> 2009
ME 22, &para; 9, 967 A.2d 671 (stating that, in
addressing a Confrontation Clause challenge
on appeal, we "review [the trial
court's] legal conclusions de novo").

<P20>[&para;56] Despite this language, we have
also implied&mdash;but not stated explicitly&mdash;
that, in confrontation cases, a trial court's
findings of fact underlying its legal determinations
are entitled to deference, with
appellate review for clear error only,
meaning that express and implied findings
of fact will be set aside only if not supported
by any competent evidence. <EM>Sykes,</EM>
2019 ME 43, &para; 15, 204 A.3d 1282. This case
exemplifies the reason for deference to be
given to factual findings because, during
the pretrial hearing on the admissibility of
the out-of-court statement, the court was
called upon to evaluate the testimonial
credibility of the police officer to whom the
victim reported the assault. As we have
often said, we are in no position to make
assessments of credibility and evidentiary
weight based on "a cold transcript." <EM>See,
e.g., State v. Patterson,</EM> 2005 ME 26, &para; 16,
868 A.2d 188; <EM>State v. Robards,</EM> 623 A.2d
168, 169 (Me. 1993). Accordingly, I defer to
the factual determinations made by the
trial court.

<P20>[&para;57] When combined with the de novo
standard of review for <EM>legal</EM> determinations,
this results in a bifurcated standard
&mdash;deferential for factual findings, de
novo for legal conclusions.<fnr11> That, however,
is not the end of the matter because some
nuance may be necessary to locate the line
separating facts from legal determinations.
<EM>See Fortune v. State,</EM> 2017 ME 61, &para; 13,
158 A.3d 512 (stating, in a post-conviction
case, "We recognize that such a `mix' of
legal and factual questions can be difficult
to tease apart."); <EM>State v. Hunt,</EM> 2016 ME
172, &para; 33, 151 A.3d 911 (stating that our
adoption of a bifurcated standard in cases
involving the voluntariness of confessions
left unresolved "the contours of the analysis"
because of "confusion about the precise
location of the line between the facts
to be determined&mdash;exclusively the task of
the trial court&mdash;and the legal question of
the ultimate determination regarding voluntariness"
(quotation marks omitted)).
The same may be true here, with a blend
of elements: facts to be considered with
deference to the trial court's findings; an
articulation of the legal test to be applied,
which is a pure legal exercise; and an
analysis somewhere in the middle where
the legal criteria are applied to the facts.
<Page 1162>

<P20>[&para;58] A precise demarcation of that line,
however, is an issue that I do not address
because the State has not argued that the
standard of review should be refined by
narrowing the scope of issues to be reviewed
de novo (something that would be
to the State's benefit, at least in appeals
brought by a defendant who challenges an
adverse confrontation ruling by the trial
court). Rather, in its brief the State recites
only the de novo language taken from our
caselaw. I therefore address the merits in
this case giving deference to the trial
court's factual findings but considering all
other aspects of the issues as in the first
instance, without any such deference.

<P20>[&para;59] Determination of the proper standard
of review also implicates the question
of whether Sheppard preserved the confrontation
issue at trial. Here, during the
trial proper, when the State presented the
jury with evidence of the victim's extrajudicial
statement during its case-in-chief,
Sheppard did not object. In some circumstances,
this would result in a waiver of
the challenge on appeal and allow narrower
appellate review that is significantly
deferential to the trial court and therefore
more favorable to the proponent of the
evidence. <EM>Sykes,</EM> 2019 ME 43, &para; 13, 204
A.3d 1282. Here, however, the admissibility
of the statement was explicitly litigated
during a pretrial hearing, and the court's
resulting ruling that the evidence would be
admitted over Sheppard's Confrontation
Clause objection was clear and definitive.
Consequently, the absence of an objection
when the State presented the evidence
during trial in no way renders the appellate
challenge unpreserved. <EM>See Sykes,</EM>
2019 ME 43, &para;&para; 14-15, 204 A.3d 1282. To
the extent the Court suggests otherwise,
<EM>see</EM> Court's Opinion &para; 14 n.5, I disagree.
Sheppard's challenge on appeal therefore
is properly treated as being fully before
us.

<P20>[&para;60] As a final point regarding the standard
of review, any error committed by
the court in its ruling is not harmless. The
State presented evidence, without objection,
that when the victim was treated at a
hospital, she told a nurse that "her boyfriend
had assaulted her," and medical records
with the same information were admitted
into evidence. The <EM>only</EM> evidence
identifying <EM>Sheppard</EM> as her boyfriend,
however, is contained in the extrajudicial
statement she made to the patrol officer,
which is the subject of this appeal. The
"boyfriend" is otherwise unnamed and
would not allow a jury to reasonably make
the connection to Sheppard himself. Therefore,
the issue presented here is consequential,
and any associated error is far
from harmless. <EM>See Judkins,</EM> 2024 ME 45,
&para;&para; 22-28, 319 A.3d 443.

<HN00><EMB>B. Application of the Law to the Facts</EMB>

<P20>[&para;61] Now, the merits.

<P20>[&para;62] On the morning when trial was
scheduled to begin, the parties advised the
court that the named victim could not be
located and so would not appear to testify.
The State signaled that it nonetheless
wanted to present evidence of a statement
she had made to a police officer. Sheppard
requested that the court hold a pretrial
hearing, out of the jury's presence, to determine
whether the out-of-court statement
was admissible both within an exception
to the hearsay rule and consistent
with his constitutional right of confrontation.
The witnesses who testified during
the pretrial hearing were the patrol officer
to whom the victim made the statement
and another officer, who talked with her
later at the hospital.

<P20>[&para;63] After hearing the evidence, the
court announced its findings of fact, all of
which have support in the record. I recount
the findings here, without reference
to evidence that was presented later, during
<Page 1163>
the trial proper. This is because if, as I
maintain and discuss above, we defer to
the trial court's factual determinations to
the extent supported by the record evidence,
we must look <EM>only</EM> to the record
developed during the pretrial proceeding
that generated the court's ruling. In its
Opinion, the Court refers also to the <EM>trial</EM>
record, Court's Opinion &para;&para; 2-4, 27, 36, and,
in fact, explicitly confirms that it is engaging
in an analysis that blends the motion
hearing record and the trial record, <EM>id.</EM>
&para; 14 n.5. But the Court cannot have it both
ways&mdash;deferring to the trial court's factual
findings and also bolstering support for
those findings with evidence that had not
yet even been presented to the court. The
record we may properly review should be
limited to the evidence presented by the
parties to the trial court during the pretrial
motion hearing, which necessarily was
the predicate for the court's ruling. Accordingly,
the following outline of the trial
court's findings and supporting evidence
does not, for example, report evidence
about the magnitude of the victim's injuries
that the State&mdash;for whatever reason&mdash;
chose <EM>not</EM> to present during the motion
hearing but offered in more detail later,
during the trial in its case-in-chief, <EM>after</EM>
the court had already ruled on the issue
before us.

<P20>[&para;64] On a day in early June of 2020, at
around 6:00 a.m., a Lewiston patrol officer
was on duty in a cruiser and saw a woman
walking. It appeared to the officer that
"something was wrong with her face" and
that she looked to be in distress. When the
officer stopped to check on her, he saw
that her face was swollen and bleeding.
The officer testified that the woman
promptly and spontaneously told him "that
her boyfriend, Ramel Sheppard, had assaulted
her." Additionally, although not
referenced in the court's express findings,
evidence was presented during the in limine
hearing that she also told the officer
that she was scared, that she did not want
to talk with him there, and that she accepted
the officer's offer to drive her to the
hospital.

<P20>[&para;65] The assault had occurred nearly a
mile from where the officer encountered
the victim on the street. At the hospital,
the victim told a different police officer, a
domestic violence investigator, that after
the assault, she left the location where it
had happened and stopped at a friend's
house, which was roughly one-half mile
from where the assault occurred, to get
money. She then left the friend's residence
and continued on, until the patrol officer
saw her and stopped to check on her.
Approximately twenty minutes elapsed between
the assault and her contact with the
patrol officer.

<P20>[&para;66] The court concluded that the out-of-court
statement would not be excluded
by the general prohibition against the admission
of hearsay evidence because the
statement was an excited utterance&mdash;there
had been a startling event, the statement
was related to it, and it was made while
the declarant was under the stress of the
event. <EM>See</EM> M.R. Evid. 803(2). The court
then also determined that the statement
was not testimonial for the combined reasons
that it was made under those circumstances,
which meet the hearsay rule's definition
of an excited utterance, and that it
was made spontaneously to a person she
had not expected to encounter.

<P20>[&para;67] I agree with the Court that the
trial court did not exceed the scope of its
discretion by concluding that the out-of-court
statement fell within the excited utterance
hearsay exception. Court's Opinion
&para; 18. In my view, this conclusion on appeal
is a function of the tolerant standard of
review governing appellate review of a ruling
based on the rules of hearsay. <EM>See
State v. Curtis,</EM> 2019 ME 100, &para; 30, 210
A.3d 834 ("We review the court's foundational
findings or implicit findings to support
<Page 1164>
admissibility of [excited utterance] evidence
for clear error, and ... will uphold
those findings unless no competent evidence
supports them." (quotation marks
omitted)).

<P20>[&para;68] As I explain above, however,
<EM>Crawford</EM> and its progeny make clear that
when it comes to the Confrontation Clause,
the analysis is fundamentally different
from hearsay law in two ways. <EM>Crawford,</EM>
541 U.S. at 59-65, 124 S.Ct. 1354. First,
<EM>Crawford</EM> established that a determination
of whether admission of the evidence at
issue would violate the accused's right of
confrontation is unrelated to the hearsay
framework. <EM>Id.</EM> at 42-59, 124 S.Ct. 1354.
This pronouncement is why <EM>Crawford</EM> is
such an important case&mdash;by overruling
<EM>Roberts,</EM> which had essentially equated the
content of the Confrontation Clause with
at least some of a court's administrative
rules allowing the admission of certain
hearsay evidence. And second, as I discuss
above, the legal aspects of a ruling based
on the Confrontation Clause are subject to
de novo review on appeal, in marked contrast
to the deferential standard of review
of rulings based on rules of evidence.

<P20>[&para;69] I will first consider whether, as a
legal matter, there was an "ongoing emergency"
attendant to the out-of-court statement
given that, as I note above, the
<EM>Bryant</EM> Court described that consideration
as among the most important ones relevant
to determining if the statement was
testimonial. 562 U.S. at 361, 131 S.Ct.
1143. Then, because the Supreme Court
also has made clear that a statement may
be nontestimonial even in the absence of
an "ongoing emergency," <EM>Ohio v. Clark,</EM>
576 U.S. 237, 244-45, 135 S.Ct. 2173, 192
L.Ed.2d 306 (2015); <EM>Bryant,</EM> 562 U.S. at
358, 131 S.Ct. 1143, I will consider whether
the statement is testimonial as seen from a
more general perspective.

<HN20><EMB>1. Ongoing Emergency</EMB>

<P20>[&para;70] From an objective perspective,
which is the one we are required to take,
<EM>Bryant,</EM> 562 U.S. at 368-69, 131 S.Ct. 1143,
there was no <EM>ongoing</EM> emergency when the
victim told the officer what had happened
to her and who was responsible. The victim
had been assaulted, resulting in visible injuries
of facial bleeding and swelling. To
be clear, this assault&mdash;by its very nature
and as shown by her injuries&mdash;<EM>had</EM> created
an emergency. But by the time the officer
encountered the victim, that emergency, as
understood within Confrontation Clause
jurisprudence, had dissipated. This is manifest
from the salient factors known to her,
as set out by the Supreme Court in <EM>Bryant</EM>
and which I now discuss seriatim.

<P20>[&para;71] First, the victim reported to the
officer that it was her boyfriend who assaulted
her. In other words, this was an
incident of domestic violence&mdash;which
<EM>Bryant</EM> characterizes as a private dispute
rather than one that poses a risk of harm
to a larger universe of people such as
members of the public or the officer himself,
562 U.S. at 363, 372-73, 131 S.Ct.
1143. Here, when she talked to the patrol
officer, the victim was no longer in the
defendant's presence and, in fact, was
twenty minutes and nearly a mile removed
from him. Moreover, she was in the immediate
presence of a police officer and had
the safety he could provide her. And even
beyond those factors, after the victim had
left the scene of the assault, she went to a
friend's residence&mdash;not to hide or to seek
shelter or protection&mdash;but to get money,
and she then chose to leave that residence
and continued on, outside on the street,
further demonstrating that the emergency
had dissipated. A reasonable person objectively
viewing the situation could not perceive
that the emergency was still happening
by the time she talked to the officer.
<Page 1165>

<P20>[&para;72] Second, although the victim did not
specify how Sheppard assaulted her, there
was no indication that he had used a weapon.
As stated by the Supreme Court, this
reduces the specter of an ongoing emergency,
compared to a situation, for example,
where the perpetrator had used a
firearm or other comparable weapon,
which broadens a threat to public safety.
As the <EM>Bryant</EM> Court explained, when the
assailant uses "only ... his fists," the
emergency created by the assault may be
seen to end when the victim is physically
separated from and is no longer in the
presence of the assailant. 562 U.S. at 364,
131 S.Ct. 1143. That was the situation the
victim was in when she made the accusation
to the patrol officer.

<P20>[&para;73] These factors lead to the next consideration,
which accounts for the motivation
leading to the assault. <EM>Bryant,</EM> 562
U.S. at 372, 374, 377, 131 S.Ct. 1143.
Again, because the assault occurred in the
context of a domestic crime without evidence
of weaponry, the emergency subsided
when the victim left the defendant's
presence.

<P20>[&para;74] Fourth, when the victim reported
the assault to the officer, she was in evident
distress and had observable injuries
to her face, prompting the officer to offer
to transport her to the hospital. Her emotional
and physical condition is relevant to
the extent that her immediate situation
bears on the purpose, viewed objectively,
that someone in those circumstances would
have in telling the officer what had happened.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 360, 131 S.Ct. 1143. In contrast
to a calm and controlled situation, the
victim's circumstances, taken alone, could
support the conclusion that the purpose of
the disclosure was, at least in part, to seek
assistance rather than to provide prosecutorial
information. For several reasons,
however, any such conclusion here is questionable
and, at the very least, carries less
significance than it might in other situations.

<P20>[&para;75] As I note above, although she had
been injured by the assault, there was no
longer an emergency.

<P20>[&para;76] But perhaps even more tellingly,
the <EM>content</EM> of the victim's statement reveals
why she spontaneously told the officer
what had happened. She did not say
simply that she had been assaulted. If that
were the extent of her disclosure, it would
match more closely with an intent primarily
to seek medical help. If she had even
said only that her boyfriend had assaulted
her, that would be more supportive of a
conclusion that she reported the incident
for the purpose of getting aid. But instead
of limiting the scope of her disclosure in
those ways, she specifically named her assailant
&mdash;her statement was that her boyfriend,
<EM>Ramel Sheppard,</EM> had assaulted
her. And she made that disclosure to a law
enforcement officer. Going so far as to
identify the perpetrator was unrelated to
any effort to seek immediate assistance.
Surely, when the particular circumstances
before us are viewed through an objective
lens&mdash;including the fact that the accusation
was leveled temporally and geographically
remotely from the crime, that the statement
specified who committed the crime,
and that it was made to a police officer
with no one else around&mdash;such a declarant
can only have had a significant appreciation
that the information would be used to
investigate and prosecute the person she
accused.<fnr12>

<P20>[&para;77] In this context, another aspect of
the trial court's analysis bears mention. As
<Page 1166>
I noted above, the trial court imported,
wholesale, its excited utterance analysis
into its ultimate determination that admission
of the out-of-court statement would
not violate Sheppard's confrontation right.
When, as here, this approach is taken
without clarification or nuance, at the very
least the court runs the risk of committing
the analytical mistake that was addressed
as the core of <EM>Crawford</EM> and allowing the
confrontation issue to turn on the subjective,
emotional condition of the declarant&mdash;
a proper hearsay consideration but not a
proper constitutional factor.

<P20>[&para;78] This is because <EM>Crawford</EM> makes
clear that the rationale and purposes of
the Confrontation Clause and the excited
utterance hearsay exception are entirely
separate from and unrelated to each other.
Among other things, a determination that
a hearsay statement is admissible as an
excited utterance requires a finding that
the declarant made the statement while
under the influence of the startling event.
M.R. Evid. 803(2); <EM>Curtis,</EM> 2019 ME 100,
&para; 30, 210 A.3d 834. This is entirely a
subjective criterion, unlike the confrontation
analysis, which is objectively based. In
this way, the theory goes, the hearsay
framework provides some inherent measure
of reliability because it requires a
showing that the declarant was actually so
affected by the startling event so as to
make fabrication unlikely. <EM>See Sykes,</EM> 2019
ME 43, &para; 18, 204 A.3d 1282; <EM>State v.
Anderson,</EM> 409 A.2d 1290, 1302 (Me. 1979).
The right of confrontation, in contrast, is
not rooted in concerns for the statement's
reliability but rather is a function of the
criminal process itself. <EM>Crawford,</EM> 541 U.S.
at 58-68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Therefore, it
would be a mistake to say that an out-of-court
statement meeting the test of the
hearsay exception is necessarily or even
presumptively nontestimonial within the
meaning of the Confrontation Clause&mdash;in
other words, that someone who was so
under the influence of the startling event
(the hearsay question) could not have had
the wherewithal to intend that the statement
be used for prosecutorial purposes
(the Confrontation Clause question). Were
it otherwise, <EM>any</EM> statement that falls within
the excited utterance exception would,
definitionally, also be admissible within the
constitutional framework&mdash;a notion found
in <EM>Ohio v. Roberts</EM> but later abandoned in
<EM>Crawford.</EM>

<P20>[&para;79] This case presents a good example
of that situation: the out-of-court statement
was admissible hearsay but, in my
view, constitutionally inadmissible. Our recent
decision in <EM>Judkins</EM> reiterated this
point, stating that, pursuant to the federal
constitution, "evidence that would otherwise
be admissible under an exception to
the hearsay rule may be barred by the
Confrontation Clause." 2024 ME 45, &para; 16,
319 A.3d 443 (quotation marks omitted).
Therefore, a declarant's excited state is far
from dispositive on the question of whether
the statement was nontestimonial.

<P20>[&para;80] Finally, pursuant to the <EM>Bryant</EM>
framework I outline above, the formality of
the setting is to be considered. Here, the
victim made the statement to an officer on
the street and without any prompting or
lead-in from the officer. This is certainly
an unstructured and informal environment,
distinct from, say, an investigatory interrogation
about a past criminal event conducted
at a police station, which is cited as an
example of a formal situation. <EM>See Clark,</EM>
576 U.S. at 245, 135 S.Ct. 2173; <EM>Bryant,</EM>
562 U.S. at 357, 366, 131 S.Ct. 1143; <EM>Crawford,</EM>
541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354. When
the out-of-court statement is made in an
informal setting, the statement is "less
likely" to be testimonial. <EM>Clark,</EM> 576 U.S. at
245, 135 S.Ct. 2173. But informality is not
dispositive on the issue; as the Supreme
Court has stated, simply because a statement
was made in an informal setting does
not mean that there was an ongoing emergency
<Page 1167>
or that the declarant's purpose was
something other than leveling an accusation
to aid in an investigation. <EM>Bryant,</EM> 562
U.S. at 366, 131 S.Ct. 1143. In the case
before us, while the <EM>setting</EM> was informal,
the statement itself was indicative of formality
because "[a]n accuser who makes a
formal statement to government officers
bears testimony in a sense that a person
who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance
does not." <EM>Crawford,</EM> 541 U.S. at 51,
124 S.Ct. 1354. As I explain above, a victim's
choice in a nonemergency environment
to specifically name her assailant
tends to reveal an understanding that the
information would be used to investigate
and possibly prosecute him, just as a person
who makes such a statement in a more
formal setting would expect. Nonetheless,
to the extent there is a lack of formality
attendant to the present situation, it is a
factor that is relevant to the constitutional
question, and it is one that I consider as
part of the wider analysis.

<P20>[&para;81] And in that wider analysis, drawn
from an objective view of the circumstances
surrounding the declaration, I can
conclude only that there was no ongoing
emergency. When the victim made the
statement, she was outside and with a
uniformed police officer but with no one
else around. The assault was domestic,
with no indicia of a threat to others. The
crime had occurred nearly a mile from
where the officer encountered the victim,
and she had walked that distance out in
the open. During the approximately twenty
minutes that had elapsed since the assault,
she had gone to a friend's residence
but did not seek sanctuary or protection;
rather, she went only to pick up money. I
do not minimize her distress, which was
plain to the officer, but the fact remains
that, objectively, the emergency had
passed.

<P20>[&para;82] Pursuant to controlling federal
case law, the existence of an ongoing
emergency is among the most important
factors used to determine if a statement is
testimonial, <EM>Bryant,</EM> 562 U.S. at 361, 131
S.Ct. 1143, and it was not present here.
Pursuant to this central aspect of the constitutional
inquiry, admission at trial of the
nontestifying accuser's statement as part
of the patrol officer's testimony violated
Sheppard's right of confrontation.

<HN20><EMB>2. Primary Purpose</EMB>

<P20>[&para;83] Despite the centrality of the ongoing-emergency
factor to the constitutional
framework, the analysis does not end
there. That is because, several times now,
the Supreme Court has made clear that it
has not attempted to articulate an exhaustive
list of circumstances that define and
distinguish between testimonial and non-testimonial
statements. <EM>Clark,</EM> 576 U.S. at
244-45, 135 S.Ct. 2173; <EM>Bryant,</EM> 562 U.S. at
356-58, 131 S.Ct. 1143; <EM>Davis,</EM> 547 U.S. at
822, 126 S.Ct. 2266; <EM>Crawford,</EM> 541 U.S. at
68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The Court has explained,
however, that the identification of
those circumstances is a function of the
broader principle first set out in <EM>Crawford,</EM>
namely, that "testimony" is a "solemn declaration
of affirmation made for the purpose
of establishing or proving some fact."
<EM>Id.</EM> at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (quotation marks
omitted); <EM>see Clark,</EM> 576 U.S. at 244, 135
S.Ct. 2173; <EM>Bryant,</EM> 562 U.S. at 358, 131
S.Ct. 1143 (stating that when "the primary
purpose of an interrogation is to respond
to an `ongoing emergency,' its purpose is
not to create a record for trial and thus is
not within the scope of the [Confrontation]
Clause."); <EM>Davis,</EM> 547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct.
2266. In determining the primary purpose
behind the declaration, the salient question
remains what a "reasonable participant[]"
would have intended based on the statements
actually made and the surrounding
circumstances. <EM>Bryant,</EM> 562 U.S. at 360,
131 S.Ct. 1143.
<Page 1168>

<P20>[&para;84] The substance and detail of the
victim's accusation establish, in my view,
that the purpose of a reasonable person in
her circumstances would have been to provide
the police with specific, inculpatory
information about the assault. In particular,
as I discuss above, when she told the
patrol officer what had happened, her
choice to identify Sheppard by name and
by relationship would make clear to a reasonable
participant that she was providing
information that would assist in a future
prosecution against Sheppard. As the situation
is seen through an objective lens, if
the victim were making only a "cry for
help," <EM>see Davis,</EM> 547 U.S. at 832, 126 S.Ct.
2266, or if she had only been seeking medical
assistance, there would have been no
reason to say anything other than she had
been assaulted. But by also saying that it
was her boyfriend who perpetrated the
assault <EM>and</EM> that her boyfriend's name was
Ramel Sheppard, her statement manifestly
ranges into testimony. Further, she provided
this information to a <EM>police officer,</EM> a
person with known investigative and arrest
authority. She also knew that the threat
posed by Sheppard had ended almost a
mile away and twenty minutes before. The
diminishment of the threat is objectively
revealed further by her detour to a
friend's house, for the limited purpose of
getting money and not seeking refuge.
And despite her subjective distress, she
was in the immediate presence of the officer,
a source of protection. Given all these
circumstances, seen objectively, a crime
victim can only have understood that her
accusation was "potentially relevant to later
criminal prosecution" of Sheppard. <EM>See
id.</EM> at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266.

<P20>[&para;85] Therefore, even going beyond the
"ongoing emergency" analysis, when the
bedrock "primary purpose" principle is invoked,
it is evident that the victim's out-of-court
accusation of Sheppard was testimonial.

<CN><EMB>III. CONCLUSION</EMB>

<P20>[&para;86] The trial court did not commit
reversible error when it concluded that the
victim's extrajudicial statement to a police
officer was not subject to exclusion as inadmissible
hearsay. The same statement,
however, was testimonial because, when
she accused Sheppard, specifically, of having
assaulted her, she bore witness against
him. As a constitutional requirement, her
out-of-court statement to the police was
therefore admissible only if she appeared
at trial and Sheppard had the opportunity
to cross-examine her. Neither happened.
Consequently, the court's admission of evidence
of the accusation violated Sheppard's
right to confront her as a witness.

<P20>[&para;87] The judgment of conviction entered
against Sheppard should be set aside
because of this constitutional deprivation.
Respectfully, I dissent.
<FN>
<fnt*> Although Justice Jabar participated in the appeal,
he retired before this opinion was certified.
Although he was not present at oral
argument, Justice Hjelm participated in the
development of this opinion. <EM>See</EM> M.R. App. P.
12(a)(2) ("A qualified Justice may participate
in a decision even though not present at oral
argument.").

<fnt1> The statute has since been amended. P.L.

P.L. 2023, ch. 465, &sect; 4 (effective Oct. 25,
2023). The amendments do not affect this
appeal.

<fnt2> The statute has since been amended. P.L.

P.L. 2023, ch. 465, &sect; 2 (effective Oct. 25,
2023). The amendments do not affect this
appeal.

<fnt3> The parties represented to the court that the
victim could not be located for trial.

<fnt4> The testimony that Simoneau and the investigator
later gave before the jury about their
interactions with the victim was consistent
with their voir dire testimony.

<fnt5> The dissent posits that our review of the
trial court's decision to admit the victim's
statement identifying Sheppard as her assailant
is confined to the evidence adduced at
the voir dire hearing on Sheppard's motion
in limine and may not include any evidence
admitted at trial. Dissenting Opinion &para; 63. Although
the trial court's decision on the motion
provided guidance, the actual admission
of the evidence occurred at trial without objection
tendered on the then-existing trial
record. Regardless, we see no significant distinction
between the evidence offered at the
hearing on the motion and the evidence presented
at trial that alters our analysis or conclusion.

<fnt6> Although Sheppard makes a passing reference
to the Maine Constitution in his brief,
the argument is undeveloped. Accordingly, we
deem it waived and limit our analysis to federal
Confrontation Clause jurisprudence. <EM>See
Mehlhorn v. Derby,</EM> 2006 ME 110, &para; 11, 905
A.2d 290; <EM>State v. Shepard,</EM> 2022 ME 11, &para; 14,
268 A.3d 274.

<fnt7> As the dissent states: "[T]he existence of an
ongoing emergency is among the most important
factors used to determine if a statement
is testimonial...." Dissenting Opinion &para; 82.
We simply disagree with the dissent's conclusion
that in this case "there was no ongoing
emergency," <EM>id.</EM> &para; 81.

<fnt8> <EM>See</EM> Dissenting Opinion &para; 76:

<B22>Going so far as to identify the perpetrator
was unrelated to any effort to seek immediate
assistance. Surely, when the particular
circumstances before us are viewed through
an objective lens&mdash;including the fact that
the accusation was leveled temporally and
geographically remotely from the crime,
that the statement specified who committed
the crime, and that it was made to a police
officer with no one else around&mdash;such a
declarant can only have had a significant
appreciation that the information would be
used to investigate and prosecute the person
she accused.

<fnt9> Article I section 6 of the Maine Constitution
contains a similar guarantee, in phraseology
that is essentially identical to the federal provision.
But as the Court notes, Court's Opinion
&para; 19 n.6, Sheppard has not presented a
meaningful argument that Maine's Constitution
augments the confrontation protections
created by the United States Constitution, so
my discussion is grounded on the federal
right, as understood from federal authority.

<fnt10> As a general matter, certain categories of
hearsay become admissible at trial because
the various criteria for admissibility provide
some indicia of reliability. <EM>See</EM> Field & Murray,
<EM>Maine Evidence</EM> &sect; 803 at 458 (6th ed.
2007). This accounts for the reason why excited
utterances, in particular, may be admissible
despite being hearsay because such
statements, by their nature, "overcome the
presumption of untrustworthiness which the
hearsay rule generally attaches to extrajudicial
statements." <EM>State v. Anderson,</EM> 409 A.2d
1290, 1302 (Me. 1979). Accordingly, the two
categories of evidence enumerated in <EM>Roberts</EM>
&mdash;some classic categories of hearsay statements
as well as other hearsay statements
that bear a high level of trustworthiness&mdash;are
conceptually similar to each other.

<fnt11> A bifurcated standard distinguishing between
factual findings and legal determinations
in cases where constitutional rights are
at stake is not unfamiliar in the criminal law.
<EM>See, e.g., Fortune v. State,</EM> 2017 ME 61, &para; 12,
158 A.3d 512 (post-conviction claims of ineffective
assistance of counsel); <EM>State v. Nadeau,</EM>
2010 ME 71, &para; 18, 1 A.3d 445 (consent to
search); <EM>State v. Tuplin,</EM> 2006 ME 83, &para; 13,
901 A.2d 792 (waiver of right to testify at
trial); <EM>State v. Watson,</EM> 2006 ME 80, &para; 31, 900
A.2d 702 (waiver of right to trial counsel);
<EM>State v. Coombs,</EM> 1998 ME 1, &para;&para; 7-8, 704 A.2d
387 (voluntariness of confessions).

<fnt12> The Court asserts that I state this as a
categorical proposition. Court's Opinion &para; 33.
I do not. My observation is explicitly predicated
on the circumstances presented in this
case, just as the Supreme Court has instructed,
<EM>see Michigan v. Bryant,</EM> 562 U.S. 344, 363,
131 S.Ct. 1143, 179 L.Ed.2d 93 (2011)&mdash;a

<P20>[&para;1] The primary issue presented in this
appeal is under what circumstances a passenger
in a motor vehicle has standing
under the Fourth Amendment to challenge
a search of the vehicle.

<P20>[&para;2] Richard W. Kelley appeals from a
judgment of conviction of aggravated trafficking
of scheduled drugs (Class A), 17-A
M.R.S. &sect; 1105-A(1)(M) (2024), entered in
the trial court (Penobscot County, <EM>A. Murray,
J.</EM>) on Kelley's conditional guilty plea.<fnr2>
Kelley's indictment followed the stop and
search of a friend's vehicle in which Kelley
was riding as a passenger. Law enforcement
conducted the search on February
22, 2021, as part of an investigation of the
vehicle's owner for drug trafficking. As
part of this investigation, law enforcement
had obtained a search warrant and two
tracking warrants authorizing the installation
and use of an electronic tracking device
to monitor the vehicle's location.

<P20>[&para;3] Kelley moved to suppress evidence
obtained through the warrants. He contends
that the court (<EM>Mallonee, J.</EM>) erred
when it denied his motion on standing
grounds. Kelley first argues that the trial
court should not have reached the question
of his standing because, at the suppression
hearing, the State stipulated that he had a
reasonable expectation of privacy in the
vehicle. He then argues that he had a
reasonable expectation of privacy in the
vehicle because he had taken several trips
as a passenger in the vehicle, including
four trips between Maine and Massachusetts
lasting eight to ten hours each, and
because he had stored a "sea bag" and
fishing boots in the vehicle for about one
month.

<P20>[&para;4] We conclude that the court did not
err in reaching the question of standing
despite the stipulation because "standing is
a threshold issue[,]" and Maine courts
have the authority and the duty to ensure
that parties "meet this basic requirement."
<EM>See State v. Lovett,</EM> 2015 ME 7, &para; 7, 109
A.3d 1135 (alteration and quotation marks
omitted). We also conclude that the court
properly denied Kelley's motion to suppress
because he lacked a reasonable expectation
of privacy in the vehicle and
therefore did not have standing to challenge
the warrants. <EM>See id.</EM> &para; 8; <EM>United
States v. Symonevich,</EM> 688 F.3d 12, 19-21
<Page 1171>
(1st Cir. 2012); <EM>Rakas v. Illinois,</EM> 439 U.S.
128, 148, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387
(1978). Because we conclude that Kelley
lacked standing to challenge the warrants,
we do not reach his arguments about their
validity. We affirm the judgment.

<CN><EMB>I. BACKGROUND</EMB>

<P20>[&para;5] We view the evidence "in the
light most favorable to the court's order on
the motion to suppress." <EM>State v. Akers,</EM>
2021 ME 43, &para; 2, 259 A.3d 127. The following
facts are supported by competent record
evidence. <EM>See id.</EM>

<P20>[&para;6] In 2020, a Maine Drug Enforcement
Agency (MDEA) Special Agent was investigating
Keith Wedge for suspected drug-related
activity. As part of his investigation,
the Special Agent obtained two warrants
authorizing the tracking of Wedge's
vehicle using an electronic tracking device.
In early 2021, the Special Agent obtained a
warrant to search Wedge's vehicle. When
MDEA agents executed the warrant and
conducted the search, Wedge was driving
the vehicle and Kelley was a passenger.
The search revealed drugs in the vehicle,
and both Wedge and Kelley were arrested.

<P20>[&para;7] Kelley was charged by complaint on
March 11, 2021, and indicted on May 26,
2021. The indictment charged Kelley with
one count of aggravated trafficking of
scheduled drugs (Class A), 17-A M.R.S.
&sect; 1105-A(1)(M), and sought criminal forfeiture
of cash discovered during the search,
15 M.R.S. &sect; 5826 (2021). On March 30,
2022, Kelley filed a motion to suppress the
evidence obtained through the two tracking
warrants and the search warrant. Kelley
made various arguments both in his
motion and orally at the suppression hearing
as to why he believed that the warrants
were deficient.

<P20>[&para;8] The court held a hearing on the
motion on December 20, 2022. Kelley and
the Special Agent both testified. At the
outset of the hearing, the State declined to
stipulate to Kelley's standing. Hence, the
evidence in the hearing explored the
standing issue.

<P20>[&para;9] Kelley testified that the vehicle was
owned by Keith Wedge, that he had known
Wedge "[Kelley's] whole life," and that
Kelley had ridden as a passenger in the
vehicle "a fair amount," including on several
trips around Mount Desert Island, on
"[a]t least five" trips from Bass Harbor to
Bangor, and on four trips to Massachusetts.
Kelley also testified that he had left
some "personal belongings" in a "sea bag"
in the vehicle for about a month, explaining
that a sea bag is "a fishing bag that
you take for spare clothes and takes care
of all your personal belongings, makes it
easy to travel with it and bring it from
boat to boat."<fnr3> Kelley did not assert an
ownership interest in the vehicle, and he
testified that he had never driven the vehicle.

<P20>[&para;10] Following Kelley's testimony, the
State "concede[d] for the purposes of the
motion to suppress that [Kelley] ha[d] a
reasonable expectation of privacy" in the
vehicle. The parties did not confirm and
the court did not indicate that the court
had accepted the stipulation.<fnr4> The court
then heard oral argument from the parties
about the validity of the warrants.
<Page 1172>

<P20>[&para;11] In an order entered on January 18,
2023, the court denied Kelley's motion to
suppress, concluding that Kelley lacked
standing to challenge the warrants. The
court concluded that because Kelley lacked
standing, it "need not address Kelley's arguments
concerning probable cause and
the validity of using data generated out of
state."

<P20>[&para;12] Kelley filed a timely motion to
reconsider, arguing that the court should
decide the motion on its merits "because
the State conceded standing at the hearing,
and the evidence presented established
standing to challenge the location
searches." He argued that "[b]ecause the
State did not challenge standing, [he] did
not argue it further in closing arguments
before the Court." Kelley also argued that
he had an expectation of privacy "in the
tracking of his movements while a passenger
in the [vehicle]" as well as a possessory
interest in the vehicle because he stored
his sea bag in the vehicle. Kelley, however,
did not request that the motion record be
reopened for the presentation of additional
evidence.

<P20>[&para;13] The court denied the motion, acknowledging
the State's stipulation but
concluding that Kelley had "fully argued
the issue of standing." The court explained
that "although the State eventually conceded
the issue, that concession was not
offered until after Kelley had argued the
issue thoroughly in his brief and had addressed
it further at the hearing." The
court added that Kelley "cite[d] no evidence
and advance[d] no legal argument
not addressed in his initial written and oral
arguments that might support his contention"
that he had standing.

<P20>[&para;14] The court held a Rule 11 hearing
on January 5, 2024, where Kelley entered
a conditional guilty plea to one count of
aggravated trafficking in scheduled drugs.
<EM>See</EM> M.R.U. Crim. P. 11(a)(2). The court
accepted Kelley's plea and entered a judgment
of conviction and an order of criminal
forfeiture, sentencing Kelley to ten years
in prison, with all but five years and one
day of the sentence suspended and four
years of probation. Kelley timely appealed.
<EM>See</EM> 15 M.R.S. &sect; 2115 (2024), M.R. App. P.
2B(b)(1).

<CN><EMB>II. DISCUSSION</EMB>

<P20>[&para;15] We begin by considering the effect
of the State's stipulation as to standing.
We then address whether Kelley had a
reasonable expectation of privacy in the
vehicle and therefore had standing to challenge
the warrants.

<HN02><EMB>A. The State's stipulation is not dispositive
because the stipulation is not
binding upon the court, and Kelley
had a full and fair opportunity to
present his evidence and argument
as to his standing to challenge the
search at the suppression hearing.</EMB>

<P20>[&para;16] Kelley argues that "[t]he lower
court should not have denied the motion on
a lack of standing because standing was
not a disputed issue." Kelley asserts that
because the State stipulated to his reasonable
expectation of privacy in the vehicle
at the suppression hearing, the court
should not have reached the issue of standing.

<P20>[&para;17] "We review [a] court's findings
on [a] motion to suppress for clear
error and the ultimate decision to suppress
de novo." <EM>Lovett,</EM> 2015 ME 7, &para; 6, 109 A.3d
1135.

<P20>[&para;18] A stipulation between the
parties does not preclude a Maine court
from addressing a standing issue. <EM>See, e.g.,
id.</EM> &para;&para; 7-9. In <EM>Lovett,</EM> Lovett appealed from
a judgment of conviction for drug trafficking
following the denial of his motion to
suppress. <EM>Id.</EM> &para;&para; 1-2. Lovett argued that
law enforcement had lacked probable
cause to search a vehicle in which he had
been riding as a passenger at the time of
<Page 1173>
the search. <EM>Id.</EM> &para;&para; 1-3. At the suppression
hearing, the State argued that Lovett
lacked standing to challenge the search,
but the motion court did not address
standing, instead concluding that the
MDEA had had sufficient probable cause
to search the vehicle. <EM>Id.</EM> &para;&para; 5, 7. The State
did not appeal the court's ruling, and neither
party briefed the issue of standing on
appeal. <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 7. We nonetheless addressed
Lovett's standing "because `[s]tanding is a
threshold issue and Maine courts are only
open to those who meet this basic requirement.'"
<EM>Id.</EM> &para; 7 (quoting <EM>Lindemann v.
Comm'n on Governmental Ethics & Election
Practices,</EM> 2008 ME 187, &para; 8, 961 A.2d
538). As we explained in <EM>Lovett,</EM> "[l]itigants
and judges at suppression hearings must
address the issue of standing because the
inquiry as to whether a defendant's Fourth
Amendment rights have been substantively
violated requires a determination as to
whether that defendant's reasonable expectation
of privacy was violated." <EM>Id.</EM> &para; 9;
<EM>cf. State v. Cyr,</EM> 501 A.2d 1303, 1305 (Me.
1985) (a certificate agreed to by the court
and the State pursuant to M.R. Crim. P.
11(a)(2) is not binding upon this Court);
<EM>State v. Drown,</EM> 447 A.2d 466, 471 (Me.
1982) (establishing that this Court "will
decide for itself" whether a State's appeal,
even when pursued with the approval of
the Attorney General pursuant to 15
M.R.S. &sect; 2115-A(5) (2024), meets the statutory
standard established by 15 M.R.S
&sect; 2115-A(1) (2024)); <EM>State v. Placzek,</EM> 380
A.2d 1010, 1012 (Me. 1977) (a lower court's
report agreed to by the State is not binding
on this Court).

<P20>[&para;19] A significant body of federal case
law holds that stipulations as to law are
generally not binding on courts,<fnr5> although
courts will make exceptions where a stipulation
by one party prejudiced the other by
inducing him to rely on that stipulation to
his detriment.

<P20>[&para;20] For example, in <EM>United States v.
Blanco,</EM> 844 F.2d 344, 349 n.4 (6th Cir.
1988), a federal drug case, the Sixth Circuit
rejected a defendant's claim that the
district court had erred "in allowing the
government to withdraw from a `stipulation'
that he had standing," insisting that
"[t]here is no evidence that [the defendant]
and the government had ever so stipulated"
and concluding that "[a]lthough the
government did state during the hearing
before the magistrate that it was satisfied
that [the defendant] had standing, we see
no prejudice to [the defendant] from the
government's reversal of its position. The
change of position was damaging in that it
led to [the defendant's] conviction, but it
was not prejudicial in the sense that he
had relied on the government's original
position to his detriment." <EM>Id.</EM> The Sixth
Circuit added that "[i]t is doubtful, indeed,
whether the government has any power to
`stipulate' as to standing; questions of law
are not generally subject to stipulation."
<EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>[&para;21] Two cases in which federal appellate
courts have found that a stipulation
bound the government also indicate that
whether a stipulation has a binding effect
hinges on whether enforcing the stipulation
would prejudice the defendant. In
<EM>United States v. Lott,</EM> which involved a
motion to suppress handguns and other
evidence gathered during a traffic stop,
the First Circuit held that the government
was bound by its stipulation at the suppression
hearing that "for purposes of this
<Page 1174>
hearing ... both Defendants ... had []
standing to challenge whether or not they
were, in fact, in possession of those firearms."
870 F.2d 778, 781 n.5 (1st Cir.
1989). The court reasoned that "when the
government has stipulated to standing,
<EM>thereby obviating the need for a defendant
to present facts relevant to standing,</EM> it
may not thereafter claim the defendant
lacked standing." <EM>Id.</EM> at 781 (emphasis added).

<P20>[&para;22] Similarly, in <EM>United States v. Hernandez,</EM>
668 F.2d 824, 826 (5th Cir. 1982),
the Fifth Circuit held that the government
could not assert on appeal that the defendants
lacked standing under the Fourth
Amendment to challenge the search of a
boat partly because at the suppression
hearings the government had stipulated to
their standing. <EM>Id.</EM> The Fifth Circuit reasoned
that because of the government's
stipulation, the defendants "never presented
evidence as to their expectation of privacy
in the boat's cabin," adding that
based on the facts, "[i]t seems likely that
appellants may have been able to demonstrate
such a legitimate expectation." <EM>Id.</EM>

<P20>[&para;23] Here, the court properly
identified standing as a threshold issue,
explaining, "Even when the parties do not
argue the question of standing in a motion
to suppress, the court must address this
issue before determining whether the motion
to suppress has any merit." <EM>See Lovett,</EM>
2015 ME 7, &para;&para; 7-9, 109 A.3d 1135. In
its denial of Kelley's motion to reconsider,
the court noted that Kelley had "fully argued
the issue of standing" and that the
court "fully considered standing." Kelley
presented argument on his standing in his
motion to suppress, in his motion to reconsider,
and at his suppression hearing,
where he testified and his attorney presented
argument. Further, although Kelley
initially argued at oral argument before us
that without the State's stipulation, "[p]erhaps
... we would have wanted to develop
[Kelley's privacy interest] further in evidence,"
Kelley eventually stated that "the
record is developed enough on this issue
... that standing has been established"
and confirmed that he had presented evidence
at the motion hearing prior to the
State's stipulation and had not identified
any additional evidence he would have offered
if not for the stipulation. In other
words, Kelley was not prejudiced by the
court's decision not to accept the State's
stipulation and fully presented his evidence
and argument on the issue of his standing.

<P20>[&para;24] We therefore conclude that the
motion court did not err in reaching the
issue of standing despite the State's stipulation.<fnr6>

<HN02><EMB>B. Kelley lacked a reasonable expectation
of privacy sufficient to give
him standing to challenge the
search of the vehicle.</EMB>

<P20>[&para;25] Kelley argues that he had a
reasonable expectation of privacy in the
vehicle because he was "a regular passenger"
who "spent hours riding in the passenger
seat" on trips "all around [Mount
Desert Island]," to Bangor, and to Massachusetts
and because he stored his fishing
boots and sea bag in the vehicle for about
a month.<fnr7>

<P20>[&para;26] "If [a] motion to suppress
asserts a violation of the Fourth Amendment,
<Page 1175>
the defendant must demonstrate
that <EM>his own</EM> reasonable expectation of privacy
was violated by the action of the
State."<fnr8> <EM>Lovett,</EM> 2015 ME 7, &para; 8, 109 A.3d
1135 (emphasis in <EM>Lovett</EM> and quotation
marks omitted). To show a reasonable expectation
of privacy in a third party's vehicle,
a passenger must show a property or
possessory interest in the vehicle or "an
interest in the property seized." <EM>Rakas,</EM>
439 U.S. at 148, 99 S.Ct. 421; <EM>see Lovett,</EM>
2015 ME 7, &para; 8, 109 A.3d 1135. On appeal,
we review the trial court's factual findings
for clear error but review the court's conclusions
of law and ultimate determination
de novo. <EM>Ornelas v. United States,</EM> 517 U.S.
690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911
(1996); <EM>State v. Barclift,</EM> 2022 ME 50, &para; 9,
282 A.3d 607.

<P20>[&para;27] In <EM>Symonevich,</EM> the First Circuit
decided a case with facts similar to those
here. 688 F.3d at 16-17. There, the First
Circuit established that a passenger on "a
nearly six hour round-trip drive" between
Maine and Massachusetts who had placed
a personal item under the passenger seat
lacked an expectation of privacy in the
vehicle. <EM>Id.</EM> at 20-21. After he was indicted,
Symonevich moved to suppress evidence
recovered during the search of the car in
which he had been riding as a passenger
on a trip between Maine and Massachusetts.
<EM>Id.</EM> at 16-20. The traffic stop was
unrelated to a separate ongoing Drug Enforcement
Agency investigation that had
identified Symonevich as a caller to a recorded
phone line. <EM>Id.</EM> at 16. Citing <EM>Rakas,</EM>
the First Circuit concluded that Symonevich
lacked standing to challenge the
search. <EM>Id.</EM> at 19-21.

<P20>[&para;28] Although the First Circuit acknowledged
that it had stated previously
"that the fact of a long trip `would engender
a slightly greater privacy expectation
than would a short trip,'" it rejected Symonevich's
claim that a passenger on a long
ride is comparable to an overnight house
guest, explaining, "We are skeptical about
the continued relevance of the type of duration
argument that Symonevich makes"
given the Supreme Court's subsequent
case law "circumscribing the amount of
privacy one can expect in a vehicle and
further differentiating searches of automobiles
from searches of homes." <EM>Id.</EM> at 20
(quoting <EM>United States v. Lochan,</EM> 674 F.2d
960, 965 (1st Cir. 1982)). The First Circuit
stopped short of "categorically rejecting
the relevance of the duration of a trip in an
<Page 1176>
automobile to the reasonable expectation
of privacy analysis," but it also concluded
that the duration of Symonevich's six-hour
trip between Maine and Massachusetts
"did nothing to enhance [his] expectation
of privacy." <EM>Id.</EM> at 21. The First Circuit
also concluded that whether Symonevich
had a possessory interest in an item placed
under the passenger seat at the time of the
stop and search by law enforcement was
irrelevant to whether he had an expectation
of privacy in the space below the seat.
<EM>Id.</EM>; <EM>see also United States v. Almeida,</EM> 748
F.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir. 2014) (noting the
factors considered when evaluating whether
a person has a reasonable expectation of
privacy in a vehicle; that a defendant must
show a property or possessory interest in
the vehicle; and that a person who is merely
a passenger lacks a reasonable expectation
of privacy in a vehicle).

<P20>[&para;29] We conclude that the court
did not err in determining that Kelley
lacked standing to challenge the warrants
here. In <EM>Symonevich,</EM> the First Circuit
concluded that taking a long trip as a
passenger in a vehicle and storing a personal
item in the vehicle had little to no
impact on an individual's expectation of
privacy in that vehicle. <EM>Symonevich,</EM> 688
F.3d at 20-21. Although Kelley spent more
time in the vehicle here than Symonevich
spent in the vehicle in his case, and unlike
the vehicle in <EM>Symonevich,</EM> the vehicle here
was the subject of electronic tracking, the
First Circuit's holding in <EM>Symonevich</EM> suggests
that spending long periods in a vehicle
and storing personal items in a vehicle
do not create a reasonable expectation of
privacy in that vehicle. <EM>See id.</EM> at 20-21.

<CN><EMB>III. CONCLUSION</EMB>

<P20>[&para;30] For the reasons given above, we
conclude that the State's stipulation regarding
whether Kelley had standing to
challenge the search of Wedge's vehicle
was not binding on the court and that
Kelley lacked a reasonable expectation of
privacy sufficient to bestow standing upon
him.

<P20>The entry is:

<P20>Judgment affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt1> Although not available at oral argument,
Chief Justice Stanfill participated in the development
of this opinion. <EM>See</EM> M.R. App. P.
12(a)(2) ("A qualified Justice may participate
in a decision even though not present at oral
argument.").

<fnt2> The court also entered an order of criminal
forfeiture, 15 M.R.S. &sect; 5826 (2021), not at
issue here. Because 15 M.R.S. &sect; 5826 has
since been amended, P.L. 2023, ch. 196, &sect; 1
(effective October 25, 2023) (codified at 15
M.R.S. &sect; 5826(6) (2024)), we cite the statute
in effect when the crime was committed.

<fnt3> At oral argument before us, Kelley stated
that during the vehicle search, no evidence
was discovered inside his sea bag.

<fnt4> Good practice when a stipulation is offered
is for the court to indicate on the record
whether the court has accepted the stipulation.
<EM>Cf. Bonville v. Bonville,</EM> 2006 ME 3, &para; 23,
890 A.2d 263 ("The court is not required to
accept the agreement of the parties, but before
it rejects it, the court must give the
parties notice of its intention and an opportunity
to present additional evidence on the
issue or issues." (quotation marks omitted)).

<fnt5> <EM>E.g., United States v. Tortorello,</EM> 533 F.2d
809, 812 (2nd Cir. 1976) ("[W]hether [the
defendant] has standing to challenge the legality
of the searches is a question of law. A
concession by the Government on a question
of law is not binding on the court."); <EM>United
States v. Lisk,</EM> 522 F.2d 228, 231 n.8 (7th Cir.
1975) (noting that even if a statement by the
government could be read as a stipulation to
standing, "[w]e are not bound to accept, as
controlling, stipulations as to questions of
law" (quotation marks omitted)).

<fnt6> As discussed <EM>infra</EM> note 7, Kelley has pursued
only a federal constitutional claim to
challenge the search. We view the impact of a
stipulation in pursuing a federal claim as raising
as a question governed by Maine law. As
noted above, however, it is immaterial whether
this impact is governed by Maine or federal
law, because the test is the same: stipulations
are not binding absent prejudice to the defendant.

<fnt7> Although Kelley quotes a decision of ours
stating that "[b]oth the United States and
Maine Constitutions guarantee citizens protection
against unreasonable searches and seizures,"
<EM>State v. Carton,</EM> 2016 ME 119, &para; 15,
145 A.3d 555, Kelley conducts no independent
analysis of the Maine Constitution, and
he does not argue that the requirements for
establishing a reasonable expectation of privacy
under the Maine Constitution differ from
those under the United States Constitution.
Therefore, although "the Maine Constitution
may offer additional protections" beyond
those provided by the Fourth Amendment, we
decline to analyze Kelley's claims under the
Maine Constitution and instead analyze them
under the United States Constitution. <EM>State v.
Glover,</EM> 2014 ME 49, &para; 10 n.2, 89 A.3d 1077;
<EM>see State v. Moore,</EM> 2023 ME 18, &para;&para; 19-20, 290
A.3d 533 (declining to analyze a Maine constitutional
claim where the defendant failed to
adequately raise the issue before the trial
court or on appeal).

<fnt8> <EM>See also Rakas v. Illinois,</EM> 439 U.S. 128, 133-34,
99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978)
("Fourth Amendment rights are personal
rights which ... may not be vicariously asserted."
(quotation marks omitted)); <EM>United
States v. Payner,</EM> 447 U.S. 727, 729, 735-37,
100 S.Ct. 2439, 65 L.Ed.2d 468 (1980) (holding
that a defendant lacked standing under
the Fourth Amendment to suppress documents
unlawfully seized from a third party
despite the "flagrant[] illegal[ity]" of the underlying
search); <EM>Alderman v. United States,</EM>
394 U.S. 165, 171-72, 89 S.Ct. 961, 22
L.Ed.2d 176 (1969) ("The established principle
is that suppression of the product of a
Fourth Amendment violation can be successfully
urged only by those whose rights were
violated by the search itself, not by those who
are aggrieved solely by the introduction of
damaging evidence.").

<P20><dgn>CHIEF JUSTICE</dgn> <author>RABNER</author> delivered
the opinion of the Court.
<SPage 426>
[MT]
<P20>In this appeal, we consider whether
the Tax Sale Law (TSL), N.J.S.A. 54:5-1
to -137, violates the Takings Clause of the
Fifth Amendment to the United States
Constitution. We evaluate the version of
the law in effect before it was amended in
2024. <EMU>L.</EMU> 2024, <EMU>c.</EMU> 39.
<SPage 427>

<P20>When property owners fail to pay
taxes on property they own, municipalities
can sell that debt at public auction under
the TSL. The successful purchaser, in effect,
pays the taxes due and has the right
to seek to foreclose and acquire title to the
property subject to various requirements.
The owner, however, can redeem the property
for the value of the debt plus interest
and costs up until the entry of final judgment.

<P20>In this case, defendant Alessandro Roberto
owned a mixed-use commercial and
residential property. He failed to pay $606
in sewer tax bills, and plaintiff 257-261
20th Avenue Realty, LLC (20th Avenue
Realty), purchased that debt pursuant to
the TSL.

<P20>Years later, plaintiff filed a lawsuit to
foreclose on the property. At the time, the
redemption amount was approximately
$33,000. Because Roberto did not respond
or redeem the property, a default judgment
was entered. As a result, Roberto
stood to lose his ownership interest in the
property. It is undisputed that the property
was worth considerably more than the
accumulated debt at the time &mdash; possibly as
much as $500,000 more.

<P20>The trial court ultimately vacated the
judgment under <EMU>Rule</EMU> 4:50-1(f), which allows
for judgments to be set aside in exceptional
circumstances. The Appellate Division
upheld that ruling.

<P20>While the appeal was pending, the United
States Supreme Court decided <EMU>Tyler v.
Hennepin County</EMU>, 598 U.S. 631, 143 S.Ct.
1369, 215 L.Ed.2d 564 (2023). The Court in
<EMU>Tyler</EMU> held that a homeowner &mdash; faced with
forfeiture of the surplus equity in her
home under Minnesota's tax foreclosure
law &mdash; had plausibly alleged a taking in
violation of the Fifth Amendment. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at
639, 647, 143 S.Ct. 1369. The Appellate
Division therefore concluded that <EMU>Tyler</EMU>
provided a basis to vacate the judgment.

<P20>We hold that the applicable version of
the TSL in this case is unconstitutional to
the extent it allows for the forfeiture of
surplus equity without just compensation.
Certain principles underlie that holding.
We find that New Jersey recognizes a
property right to surplus equity in real
property. We also conclude that because
<SPage 428>
private lienholders act jointly with local
governments under the TSL to perform a
traditional public function &mdash; the collection
<Page 1183>
of taxes &mdash; they may be considered state
actors. And we reject the argument that
the surplus equity initially foreclosed in
this case was not taken for a public use.
Under settled law, it could not have been
taken for a private use. Plus, takings under
the TSL are not for private use; they
are designed to raise revenue for municipalities
to operate.

<P20>We therefore affirm as modified the
judgment of the Appellate Division based
on the reasoning in <EMU>Tyler</EMU>. We do not rely
on <EMU>Rule</EMU> 4:50-1(f).

<CN>I.

<CN>A.

<P20>Defendant Alessandro Roberto bought a
mixed-use commercial and residential
property in Paterson in 1997. In 2022, it
consisted of two residential apartments, a
carwash, an auto mechanic's shop, and two
vacant stores.

<P20>The record includes an uncertified comparative
analysis report prepared by a local
realtor in or about 2022. The report
suggested listing the property at $475,000
to $535,000. The property was not encumbered
by a mortgage.

<P20>Roberto failed to pay three sewer tax
bills on the property: two bills in 2010 in
the amount of $226.57 and $88.24, and a
third in 2016 in the amount of $291.19. The
three unpaid bills totaled $606, and the
City of Paterson placed tax liens on the
property for that amount. Plaintiff bought
three corresponding tax sale certificates at
public auction in 2010 and 2016. The trial
court observed that "plaintiff apparently
also paid other taxes and potentially some
other charges along the way." The record
contains no details about additional payments
other than plaintiff's counsel's representation
at oral argument before the
trial court.
<SPage 429>

<P20>In June 2021, plaintiff filed a tax foreclosure
complaint in Superior Court. Roberto
then offered $9,000 to the tax collector's
office to try to redeem the property.
Because Roberto owed more than that
amount, his offer was declined. In response
to plaintiff's request, the trial court
later set the amount of redemption at
$32,973.15 and the deadline to redeem on
December 21, 2021. Roberto neither answered
the complaint nor paid the redemption
amount, and the court entered a final
judgment in plaintiff's favor on February
2, 2022.

<P20>In the days that followed, Roberto filed
for bankruptcy and also sought to void the
final judgment in bankruptcy court. That
case was later dismissed. On April 1, 2022,
within two months of the final judgment,
Roberto moved before the Superior Court
to vacate the judgment, permit redemption
under <EMU>Rule</EMU> 4:50-1(e) and (f),<fnr1> and restore
title to the property.

<P20>In support of his motion, Roberto argued
that he had posted $40,000 in escrow
with his attorneys to redeem the property
and intended to post an additional $10,000.
(He did so before the hearing.) He noted
that he paid $26,000 for the property in
1997 and invested about $200,000 in renovations
and improvements since then.

<P20>Roberto explained that he "lost substantial
income from [the p]roperty because of
[his] tenants' failure to pay rent" "[d]ue to
the Covid-19 global pandemic," which prevented
him from redeeming the tax sale
certificates. He asserted that one tenant
had failed to pay $9,600 and a second owed
$15,000. He added that, at age seventy-five,
the "[p]roperty was crucial to [his]
<Page 1184>
retirement because it ha[d] over several
hundred thousand dollars in equity" beyond
the amount of past taxes owed.
<SPage 430>

<P20>Plaintiff opposed the motion. Among
other things, plaintiff disputed the impact
of Covid and pointed to rental payments
made by, or on behalf of, tenants. Roberto,
in turn, conceded that "Covid was not the
cause of this ... but it didn't help ... the
situation."

<P20>The trial court found the case was "exceptional"
and "warrant[ed] relief under
<EMU>Rule</EMU> 4:50-1(f)." The court observed that
when "owners hold substantial equity in
... property, the system can be Dickensian."
In this case, the court noted, Roberto
had "put up" the money to redeem, and
the property had "very substantial equity
relative to the lien." The trial judge did not
rely on the effect of Covid; it found that
"Covid may or may not have had an impact"
on Roberto's ability to collect rents.
Under the totality of the circumstances,
the court concluded "it would be inequitable
... to allow a forfeiture of such significant
equity for a seventy-five-year-old
man."

<P20>The court's ruling to vacate final judgment
had several conditions: Roberto had
to pay the full redemption amount as well
as $12,400 in attorney's fees and costs
within forty-five days. The court did not
grant relief under <EMU>Rule</EMU> 4:50-1(e).

<P20>Roberto complied with the conditions
and, on June 13, 2022, regained title to the
property.

<CN>B.

<P20>Plaintiff appealed. While the appeal was
pending, the United States Supreme Court
decided <EMU>Tyler</EMU>. In that case, a county government
seized a tax-delinquent home under
Minnesota's tax foreclosure law. 598
U.S. at 635, 143 S.Ct. 1369. After a foreclosure
sale, the county kept the equity in the
home above the amount of the debt. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
The Supreme Court found that the forfeiture
of the homeowner's surplus equity
plausibly "stated a claim under the Takings
Clause" of the Fifth Amendment that
entitled her to just compensation. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at
639, 647, 143 S.Ct. 1369.
<SPage 431>

<CN>C.

<P20>The Appellate Division affirmed the trial
court's judgment. <EMU>257-261 20th Ave. Realty,
LLC v. Roberto</EMU>, 477 N.J. Super. 339,
350, 307 A.3d 19 (App. Div. 2023). It concluded
that the decision in <EMU>Tyler</EMU> provided
cause to vacate judgment, <EMU>id.</EMU> at 350, 307
A.3d 19, because New Jersey's Tax Sale
Law, like Minnesota's scheme, "permit[s]
foreclosure of a property owner's equity"
"above the lien amount owed," "and is thus
a prohibited taking after <EMU>Tyler</EMU>," <EMU>id.</EMU> at 362,
307 A.3d 19.

<P20>The appellate court rejected the notion
that <EMU>Tyler</EMU> does not apply to third-party
purchasers like plaintiff. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 365, 307
A.3d 19. The court explained that "[t]he
government cannot confer to a third-party"
a greater recovery than the public
entity itself is entitled to. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 365-66, 307
A.3d 19. The court also found that the
State Constitution provides greater protection
to property owners than the United
States Constitution does. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 365, 307
A.3d 19 (citing <EMU>N.J. Const.</EMU> art. I, &para; 20).

<P20>The Appellate Division concluded that
<EMU>Tyler</EMU> should be given pipeline retroactivity,
not full retroactivity. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 363, 307
A.3d 19. It reasoned that "full retroactivity
would be unworkable and create a substantial
hardship for taxing authorities" and
third-party purchasers alike. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>The Appellate Division separately found
that the trial court did not abuse its discretion
when it granted relief under <EMU>Rule</EMU>
4:50-1(f). <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 368, 307 A.3d 19. The court
noted the trial judge had balanced the
equities and acted within its "sound discretion,
based on the totality of [the] facts."
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 369, 307 A.3d 19.

<CN>II.

<CN>A.

<P20>To provide relevant background information,
we begin with a summary of New
Jersey's tax foreclosure law before it was
amended in 2024.

<P20>In New Jersey, local "governments
depend on real estate taxes and
other" assessments related to real property
"as their primary sources of revenue."
<EMU>Simon v. Cronecker</EMU>, 189 N.J. 304, 318, 915
A.2d 489 (2007). The State's tax foreclosure
law provides a framework for towns
to collect a stream of revenue when property
owners do not pay their taxes. <EMU>See
ibid.</EMU>; <EMU>Varsolona v. Breen Cap. Servs.
Corp.</EMU>, 180 N.J. 605, 621-22, 853 A.2d 865
(2004).

<P20>New Jersey has had a form of tax sale
foreclosure since at least the late nineteenth
century under the Martin Act, <EMU>L.</EMU>
1886, <EMU>c.</EMU> 112. <EMU>See State v. City Council of
Camden</EMU>, 50 N.J.L. 87, 97, 11 A. 137 (Sup.
Ct. 1887); <EMU>Burgin v. Rutherford</EMU>, 56 N.J.
Eq. 666, 669-70, 38 A. 854 (Ch. 1898). The
original Tax Sale Law, enacted in 1918,
was designed "to revise the procedure for
tax sales" and "provide a uniform and simple
procedure" for municipalities to collect
property taxes. <EMU>In re Princeton Off. Park,
LP v. Plymouth Park Tax Servs. LLC</EMU>, 218
N.J. 52, 62 n.3, 93 A.3d 332 (2014) (quoting
<EMU>Sponsor's Statement to A. 52</EMU> (<EMU>L.</EMU> 1918, <EMU>c.</EMU>
237)).

<P20>Under the TSL, unpaid property
taxes create a continuous lien on a property
for taxes owed, "subsequent taxes ...,
interest, penalties and costs of collection."
N.J.S.A. 54:5-6. The TSL enables municipalities
to "convert[] that lien into a
stream of revenue by encouraging the purchase
of tax certificates on tax-dormant
properties." <EMU>Cronecker</EMU>, 189 N.J. at 318,
915 A.2d 489 (citing N.J.S.A. 54:5-19, -31
to -32). To accomplish that, towns can "issue
a certificate certifying the taxes" and
other obligations tied to the
<SPage 433>
lien.
N.J.S.A. 54:5-11, -12. Towns may then sell
the certificate at auction after notice to the
public and the property owner. N.J.S.A.
54:5-19, -26, -27, -31. Potential buyers can
start the bidding at a maximum interest
rate of 18 percent; the certificate is sold to
the bidder willing to buy it at the lowest
rate. N.J.S.A. 54:5-32.

<P20>The successful bidder "agrees to
pay ... the municipality the taxes or assessments
due," <EMU>Cronecker</EMU>, 189 N.J. at
319, 915 A.2d 489 (citing N.J.S.A. 54:5-31,
-32, -46), and can "record the certificate
... `as a mortgage on the land,'" <EMU>ibid.</EMU>
(quoting N.J.S.A. 54:5-50).

<P20>The purchase of a tax sale certificate
does not convey the property to the
buyer. <EMU>Princeton Off. Park</EMU>, 218 N.J. at 63,
93 A.3d 332. The delinquent owner still has
title to the property; the purchaser obtains
the municipality's lien. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 63, 67, 93
A.3d 332. With that, the purchaser acquires
an "inchoate interest [that] consists
of three rights: the right to receive the
sum paid for the certificate with interest";
"the right to redeem" any later-issued tax
sale certificate; "and the right to acquire
title by foreclos[ure]." <EMU>Varsolona</EMU>, 180 N.J.
at 618, 853 A.2d 865.
<Page 1186>

<P20>Property owners can redeem a tax certificate
by paying the amount tendered at
the sale, the buyer's expenses, and subsequent
taxes with interest. N.J.S.A. 54:5-58
to -60. The municipal taxing authority sets
the amount required for redemption, and
all redemptions must "be made through
the tax collector's office." N.J.S.A. 54:5-54,
-54.1.

<P20>If the property owner does not redeem,
the purchaser of the certificate can file an
action in court "to foreclose the right of
redemption." N.J.S.A. 54:5-86(a). The lawsuit
can be filed from two to twenty years
after the date the certificate was sold.
N.J.S.A. 54:5-79, -86(a). The purchaser
must give the owner thirty days' written
notice of the action, N.J.S.A. 54:5-97.1, -98,
and the owner can still redeem at any time
before the right to redeem is cut off or
final judgment is entered, N.J.S.A. 54:5-54;
<EMU>R.</EMU> 4:64-6. Once the
<SPage 434>
court enters final
judgment, title to the property "vest[s] in
the purchaser." N.J.S.A. 54:5-87.

<CN>B.

<P20>After we granted certification, the Legislature
amended the state's tax foreclosure
laws in response to <EMU>Tyler</EMU>. <EMU>L.</EMU> 2024, <EMU>c.</EMU>
39. Among other changes, property owners
facing tax foreclosure can now take steps
to preserve their equity in property being
foreclosed. <EMU>See</EMU> N.J.S.A. 54:5-87(b) (2024).
Owners can demand a judicial sale or internet
auction and seek to have any surplus
funds from the sale returned to them.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU> If no one bids on a property and the
tax sale certificate holder gets title, it is
"presumed that there is no equity in the
property." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> And if the owner does not
demand a judicial sale or internet auction,
the new law states that the owner "shall
have no claim against the holder of the tax
sale certificate for any equity in the property."
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>Governor Murphy signed the new law on
July 10, 2024. <EMU>A. 3772</EMU> (2024). The statute
provides that it "shall take effect immediately"
and "shall have no effect on any
foreclosure action in which a final judgment
has been entered prior to the effective
date of this act." <EMU>L.</EMU> 2024, <EMU>c.</EMU> 39, &sect; 11.
We asked for additional briefing on the
new law and note that it has no effect on
this appeal. For that reason, we do not
reach Roberto's argument that the revised
law is still unconstitutional.

<CN>III.

<P20>Plaintiff 20th Avenue Realty argues
there are no exceptional circumstances
that justify relief under <EMU>Rule</EMU> 4:50-1(f).
Plaintiff also contends that <EMU>Tyler</EMU> does not
apply to the TSL for three reasons: (1) no
property right to surplus equity exists in
New Jersey; (2) a private lienholder is not
a state actor; and (3) "there is no `public
purpose' when it comes to tax foreclosure."
Plaintiff, supported by the NTLA and
NJLTA, also raises various policy concerns.
Together, they submit that the Appellate
Division's ruling will jeopardize the
stability of title insurance, decrease the
likelihood of tax
<SPage 435>
foreclosures, and undercut
the ability of municipalities to generate
tax revenue.

<P20>Defendant Roberto maintains the trial
court did not abuse its discretion when it
vacated final judgment under <EMU>Rule</EMU> 4:50-1(f).
He also claims that the TSL is unconstitutional
in the wake of <EMU>Tyler</EMU> because
the law allows for the forfeiture of a property
owner's equity without just compensation.

<P20>The Pacific Legal Foundation and Legal
Services of New Jersey argue in support
of defendant's position. Pacific Legal
Foundation submits that <EMU>Tyler</EMU> applies to
New Jersey as much as Minnesota, and
that private lienholders are liable as state
actors because of their role in the foreclosure
scheme. Legal Services of New Jersey
similarly asserts that New Jersey recognizes
<Page 1187>
a property right in surplus equity,
and that the TSL deprives property owners
of their constitutional rights.

<P20>Invest Newark raises issues about vacant,
abandoned, and deteriorating properties
in the wake of <EMU>Tyler</EMU>.

<P20>The Attorney General takes no position
on whether <EMU>Tyler</EMU> applies to the TSL. If it
does, the Attorney General argues, that
conclusion should not extend to abandoned
properties. The Attorney General also contends
that only the party foreclosing
should be required to pay any compensation
due; in other words, non-foreclosing
municipalities should not be required to
reimburse surplus equity they never obtained.

<P20>The parties and amici also debate
whether and to what extent <EMU>Tyler</EMU> should
apply retroactively.

<CN>IV.

<P20>As we discuss later, the Supreme
Court's decision in <EMU>Tyler</EMU> materially affects
the legal issues in this appeal. We therefore
address only briefly plaintiff's argument
that the trial court abused its discretion
when it vacated judgment under <EMU>Rule</EMU>
4:50-1(f).
<SPage 436>

<P20>The Rule provides that a
"court may relieve a party ... from a final
judgment or order" for various reasons,
including "any ... reason justifying relief
from the operation of the judgment or
order." <EMU>R.</EMU> 4:50-1(f). Whether to grant relief
"is left to the sound discretion of the
trial court," <EMU>Mancini v. EDS ex rel. N.J.
Auto. Full Ins. Underwriting Ass'n</EMU>, 132
N.J. 330, 334, 625 A.2d 484 (1993), and that
decision is reviewed for abuse of discretion,
<EMU>U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Guillaume</EMU>,
209 N.J. 449, 467, 38 A.3d 570 (2012).

<P20>"[R]elief ... is available only
in `exceptional circumstances.'" <EMU>Hous.
Auth. of Morristown v. Little</EMU>, 135 N.J. 274,
290, 639 A.2d 286 (1994) (quoting <EMU>Baumann
v. Marinaro</EMU>, 95 N.J. 380, 395, 471 A.2d 395
(1984)). And the Rule's "boundaries `are as
expansive as the need to achieve equity
and justice.'" <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> (quoting <EMU>Palko v. Palko</EMU>,
73 N.J. 395, 398, 375 A.2d 625 (1977)).
Nonetheless, "vacation of a judgment ...
should be granted sparingly." <EMU>In re Guardianship
of J.N.H.</EMU>, 172 N.J. 440, 473-74, 799
A.2d 518 (2002).

<P20>To decide whether to vacate
judgment under the Rule, courts consider,
among other equitable factors, the extent
of the delay in applying for relief, the
applicant's fault or blamelessness, and any
prejudice to the other party. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 474, 799
A.2d 518. "[T]he strong interests in finality
of judgments and judicial efficiency," <EMU>Guillaume</EMU>,
209 N.J. at 467, 38 A.3d 570 (quoting
<EMU>Mancini</EMU>, 132 N.J. at 334, 625 A.2d 484),
are also balanced against "the need to
achieve equity and justice," <EMU>J.N.H.</EMU>, 172
N.J. at 474, 799 A.2d 518. In the end,
whether exceptional circumstances exist
depends on the facts of each case, and all
"doubts ... should be resolved in favor of
the parties seeking relief." <EMU>Mancini</EMU>, 132
N.J. at 334, 625 A.2d 484.

<P20>Several sources provide relevant time
limits for the Rule. In general, motions
under <EMU>Rule</EMU> 4:50-1 must be made "within a
reasonable time." <EMU>R.</EMU> 4:50-2 (specifying that
motions under sections (a), (b), and (c) of
<EMU>Rule</EMU> 4:50-1 must be made "not more than
one
<SPage 437>
year after the judgment"). The TSL
separately sets a three-month time limit to
apply to reopen a final judgment. N.J.S.A.
54:5-87.

<P20>Roberto filed his motion to vacate
judgment within two months. Under any of
the above measures, his motion was timely.

<P20>Whether exceptional circumstances were
present in this case, however, is a closer
question. The trial judge considered in
particular the substantial amount of surplus
equity in the property. Roberto owed
<Page 1188>
approximately $33,000 in delinquent taxes,
interest, and costs. Yet he may have had
hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional
equity in the property. As we discuss
next, however, that concern is properly
addressed by <EMU>Tyler</EMU>.

<P20>The Covid-19 pandemic did not factor
into the equitable analysis because, as the
trial court found, it "may or may not have
had an impact" on Roberto's ability to
collect rents.

<P20>Roberto also points to the fact that he
placed $50,000 in escrow with an attorney
to redeem the property. Plaintiff contends
that cannot amount to an exceptional circumstance
because, in order to redeem
property under the TSL, an owner must
be able to pay the outstanding amount of
tax due plus interest and costs.

<P20>Under the circumstances, we need not
resolve the dispute. We instead note that
Roberto's motion was timely and that we
do not adopt the Appellate Division's analysis
under <EMU>Rule</EMU> 4:50-1(f). <EMU>See Roberto</EMU>, 477
N.J. Super. at 368-70, 307 A.3d 19.

<P20>Following the trial court's decision to
vacate judgment, this matter was on direct
review before the Appellate Division when
the Supreme Court decided <EMU>Tyler</EMU>. We
therefore need to consider the import of
<EMU>Tyler</EMU>, which we turn to now.

<CN>V.

<CN>A.

<P20>The Takings Clause of the Fifth
Amendment provides that "private property"
shall not "be taken for public use,
without just compensation." <EMU>U.S. Const.</EMU>
amend. V. The Clause applies to
<SPage 438>
the
States through the Fourteenth Amendment.
<EMU>Tyler</EMU>, 598 U.S. at 637, 143 S.Ct.
1369; <EMU>Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R.R.
v. Chicago</EMU>, 166 U.S. 226, 236-37, 17 S.Ct.
581, 41 L.Ed. 979 (1897).

<P20>In <EMU>Tyler</EMU>, the Supreme Court evaluated
the Takings Clause in the context of the
foreclosure of a private home under
Minnesota's tax foreclosure scheme. 598
U.S. at 634-35, 143 S.Ct. 1369. Geraldine
<EMU>Tyler</EMU>, who was ninety-four years old,
owned a one-bedroom condominium in
Minneapolis when her family moved her to
a senior community. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 635, 143 S.Ct.
1369. In her absence, no one paid $2,300 in
property taxes due on the home. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
With interest and penalties, the debt grew
to $15,000 over five years. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> Under
Minnesota's tax forfeiture law, Hennepin
County seized the condo and sold it for
$40,000 to satisfy Tyler's debt. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> The
County kept the surplus equity of $25,000.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>Tyler sued in federal court and brought
a claim under the Takings Clause. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at
635-36, 143 S.Ct. 1369. The Supreme Court
concluded she had "stated a claim under
the Takings Clause and [was] entitled to
just compensation." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 639, 143 S.Ct.
1369. At the core of its analysis, the Court
explained "that a government may not
take more from a taxpayer than she owes."
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>To assess the question before it, the
Court looked to several sources for guidance:
state law, traditional property law
principles, historical practice, and precedent.
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 638, 143 S.Ct. 1369. The Court
first observed that Minnesota recognized a
homeowner's right to equity in real property.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU> As a result, although "[t]he
County had the power to sell Tyler's home
to recover the unpaid property taxes[,] ...
it could not ... confiscate more property
than was due." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 639, 143 S.Ct. 1369.

<P20>The Court traced that principle back to
the Magna Carta. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> It noted that the
"doctrine became rooted in English law"
and "made its way across the Atlantic"
into the law of ten states "shortly after the
founding." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 639-40, 143 S.Ct. 1369.
"[T]oday," the Court observed, "[t]hirty-six
States and the Federal Government require
<Page 1189>
that ... excess value be returned to
the taxpayer." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 642, 143 S.Ct. 1369.
<SPage 439>

<P20>The Court also reviewed precedents
for "the principle that a taxpayer is entitled
to the surplus in excess of the debt
owed." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>; <EMU>see United States v. Taylor</EMU>,
104 U.S. 216, 219, 221, 26 L.Ed. 721 (1881)
(finding a taxpayer was entitled to the
surplus equity in property sold to pay
delinquent taxes); <EMU>United States v. Lawton</EMU>,
110 U.S. 146, 149-50, 3 S.Ct. 545, 28
L.Ed. 100 (1884) (same when the federal
government kept the property instead of
selling it); <EMU>see also Nelson v. City of New
York</EMU>, 352 U.S. 103, 110, 77 S.Ct. 195, 1
L.Ed.2d 171 (1956) (noting that the relevant
ordinance did not preclude the owner
from obtaining surplus proceeds).

<P20>In addition, the Supreme Court considered
other contexts in which Minnesota
law recognized that "a property owner is
entitled to the surplus in excess of her
debt." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 645, 143 S.Ct. 1369. As examples,
the Court pointed to private creditors
seeking to enforce a judgment by selling a
debtor's real property, bank foreclosures,
the seizure of private property to pay delinquent
income taxes, and the failure to
pay taxes on other personal property. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
In each situation, the Court noted, any
surplus from the sale of property belonged
to the owner. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>In conclusion, the Court explained that
"[t]he Takings Clause `was designed to bar
Government from forcing some people
alone to bear public burdens which, in all
fairness and justice, should be borne by
the public as a whole.'" <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 647, 143
S.Ct. 1369 (quoting <EMU>Armstrong v. United
States</EMU>, 364 U.S. 40, 49, 80 S.Ct. 1563, 4
L.Ed.2d 1554 (1960)). Under the facts of
Tyler's case, "[a] taxpayer who loses her
$40,000 house to the State to fulfill a
$15,000 tax debt has made a far greater
contribution to the public fisc than she
owed." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU><fnr2>
<SPage 440>

<CN>B.

<P20><EMU>Tyler</EMU>, of course, is binding precedent
of the United States Supreme Court.
Under the Supremacy Clause, it is the
source of authority on the Takings Clause
for federal and state courts alike. <EMU>Cooper
v. Aaron</EMU>, 358 U.S. 1, 18, 78 S.Ct. 1401, 3
L.Ed.2d 5 (1958) ("Article VI of the Constitution
makes the Constitution the `supreme
Law of the Land'" and "the federal
judiciary is supreme in the exposition of
the law of the Constitution").

<P20>In <EMU>Harper v. Virginia Department
of Taxation</EMU>, 509 U.S. 86, 97, 113 S.Ct.
2510, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993), the Supreme
Court explained that when it

<B22>applies a rule of federal law to the parties
before it, that rule is the controlling
interpretation of federal law and must
be given full retroactive effect in all
cases still open on direct review and as
to all events, regardless of whether such
events predate or postdate our announcement
of the rule.

<P00><EMU>Tyler</EMU> thus applies to pending federal cases
on direct review.

<P20><EMU>Tyler</EMU> likewise applies to cases on
direct review in state court. The Supreme
Court made that clear in <EMU>Reynoldsville</EMU>
<Page 1190>
<EMU>Casket Co. v. Hyde</EMU>, 514 U.S. 749, 115
S.Ct. 1745, 131 L.Ed.2d 820 (1995).

<P20>In <EMU>Reynoldsville</EMU>, the Ohio Supreme
Court had declined to give effect to an
earlier decision of the United States Supreme
Court in <EMU>Bendix Autolite Corp. v.
Midwesco Enterprises, Inc.</EMU>, 486 U.S. 888,
108 S.Ct. 2218, 100 L.Ed.2d 896 (1988).
<EMU>Bendix</EMU> found that an Ohio tolling statute
impermissibly burdened interstate commerce
and was unconstitutional. <EMU>Reynoldsville</EMU>,
514 U.S. at 750, 115 S.Ct. 1745 (describing
<EMU>Bendix</EMU>). The Ohio Supreme Court
nonetheless continued to apply the statute
to pending "tort claims that accrued before
that decision." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 750-51, 115 S.Ct.
1745. In short order, the United States
Supreme Court stated that Ohio's holding
<SPage 441>
"violates the Constitution's Supremacy
Clause." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 751, 115 S.Ct. 1745. The
Court also rejected an "ingenious[]" argument
to view the Ohio ruling through the
lens of "remedy" instead of "retroactivity."
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 752-56, 115 S.Ct. 1745.

<P20>To evaluate whether <EMU>Tyler</EMU> should apply
to this appeal, the parties and the Appellate
Division, in part, reference case law
that considered when new <EMU>state</EMU> court rulings
should apply retroactively in state
court. <EMU>See Roberto</EMU>, 477 N.J. Super. at 362-64,
307 A.3d 19; <EMU>Coons v. Am. Honda
Motor Co.</EMU>, 96 N.J. 419, 421, 476 A.2d 763
(1984) (addressing the retroactivity of a
state court ruling that a state law violated
the Federal Constitution); <EMU>see also Salorio
v. Glaser</EMU>, 93 N.J. 447, 463-65, 461 A.2d
1100 (1983) (same); <EMU>State v. G.E.P.</EMU>, 243
N.J. 362, 386-89, 235 A.3d 157 (2020) (addressing
a state court ruling on the scope
of expert testimony).

<P20>Our case law looks to some of
the same principles that federal courts use
to decide if decisions should apply retroactively.
<EMU>See State v. Wessells</EMU>, 209 N.J. 395,
411 n.4, 37 A.3d 1122 (2012). But those
principles do not apply here because "[t]he
Supremacy Clause does not allow federal
retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by
the invocation of a contrary approach to
retroactivity under state law." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> (quoting
<EMU>Harper</EMU>, 509 U.S. at 100, 113 S.Ct.
2510). In other words, when the United
States Supreme Court applies a principle
of federal law to all cases on direct appeal,
state courts are bound by that approach.

<P20>This case involves the application of controlling
federal law, which the United
States Supreme Court applied to the parties
before it in <EMU>Tyler</EMU>. <EMU>Harper</EMU> and <EMU>Reynoldsville</EMU>
thus require that the law be applied
to pending cases on direct review in
both federal and state court.

<P20>Here, the trial court vacated the
final judgment of foreclosure, and plaintiff
appealed that ruling. As a result, this case
is not final; it is still pending. We therefore
agree with the Appellate
<SPage 442>
Division that
<EMU>Tyler</EMU> applies to this appeal, but we reach
that conclusion without conducting our
own retroactivity analysis.<fnr3>

<P20>To assess the parties' arguments and
determine whether the taking of Roberto's
property was without just compensation
contrary to the Fifth Amendment, we
<Page 1191>
therefore consider the principles the Supreme
Court articulated in <EMU>Tyler</EMU>.

<CN>VI.

<P20>Plaintiff contends <EMU>Tyler</EMU> should not apply
to New Jersey's tax foreclosure scheme for
several reasons. We address each in turn.

<CN>A.

<P20>A violation of the Takings Clause requires
the taking of private property. <EMU>U.S.
Const.</EMU> amend. V. Plaintiff argues that New
Jersey did not recognize a protected property
right to surplus equity when the equity
in Roberto's property was taken.

<P20>As noted earlier, the Supreme Court in
<EMU>Tyler</EMU> looked to various sources to assess
the nature of property rights, including
state law. 598 U.S. at 638, 143 S.Ct. 1369.
The Court found that Minnesota law recognized
an owner's right to surplus value
in property beyond the value of a debt in
various situations: when private creditors
sought to enforce a judgment by selling
property; in bank foreclosures; for the seizure
of property to pay delinquent income
taxes; and for the failure to pay taxes on
other personal property. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 645, 143
S.Ct. 1369. In all those areas,
<SPage 443>
the Court
observed that surplus value belonged to
the owner under state law. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>New Jersey, similarly, has long recognized
a property right to surplus equity in
different contexts. In a civil action for foreclosure
or satisfaction of a mortgage, money
raised from the sale of the mortgaged
property "shall be applied to pay off and
discharge the moneys ordered to be paid,
<EMU>and the surplus, if any</EMU>, shall be deposited
with the court and ... <EMU>shall be paid to the
person or persons entitled thereto</EMU>, ... as
the court shall determine." N.J.S.A. 2A:50-36,
-37 (enacted in 1951) (emphases added).
The defendant in a foreclosure action,
among other claimants, may apply for the
"withdrawal of surplus moneys." <EMU>R.</EMU> 4:64-3(a),
(b); <EMU>see also</EMU> N.J.S.A. 2A:50-37; <EMU>Danes
v. Smith</EMU>, 30 N.J. Super. 292, 301-02, 104
A.2d 455 (App. Div. 1954) (acknowledging
that when a "sheriff's sale produced a substantial
surplus beyond the mortgage
debt," the surplus was "available for distribution
according to the respective interests
of the parties").

<P20>In the commercial context, surplus proceeds
must be returned to the debtor after
the foreclosure of a security interest.
N.J.S.A. 12A:9-608(a)(4), -615(d)(1) (enacted
in 2001). And when pawned property is
sold at public auction or private sale, any
surplus proceeds are due "to the pledgor
or anyone else who would have been entitled
to redeem the pledge if it had not
been sold." N.J.S.A. 45:22-27 (enacted in
1931).

<P20>The historical and traditional legal
principles relating to surplus equity, which
the Supreme Court reviewed in <EMU>Tyler</EMU>, as
well as prior precedents, are relevant here
as well. <EMU>See Tyler</EMU>, 598 U.S. at 639-45, 143
S.Ct. 1369. As in Minnesota, therefore,
property owners in New Jersey have a
recognized property right to surplus equity.

<P20>"[M]ost rights secured by the
Constitution are protected only against infringement
by governments," not private
actors.
<SPage 444>
<EMU>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co.</EMU>,
457 U.S. 922, 936, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73
L.Ed.2d 482 (1982) (quoting <EMU>Flagg Bros.,
Inc. v. Brooks</EMU>, 436 U.S. 149, 156, 98 S.Ct.
1729, 56 L.Ed.2d 185 (1978)). In general,
then, under the Fourteenth Amendment,
state action is subject to constitutional
scrutiny, but private conduct is not. <EMU>Brentwood
Acad. v. Tenn. Secondary Sch. Athletic
Ass'n</EMU>, 531 U.S. 288, 295, 121 S.Ct.
924, 148 L.Ed.2d 807 (2001). Here, plaintiff
argues that private lienholders are not
state actors, so their conduct is not subject
to the Takings Clause.
<Page 1192>

<P20>The Supreme Court in <EMU>Lugar</EMU> articulated
a two-part approach to determine whether
actions by a private party may be "fairly
attributable to the State":

<B22>First, the deprivation must be caused by
the exercise of some right or privilege
created by the State or by a rule of
conduct imposed by the State or by a
person for whom the State is responsible.
... Second, the party charged with
the deprivation must be a person who
may fairly be said to be a state actor.
This may be because he is a state official,
because he has acted together with
or has obtained significant aid from
state officials, or because his conduct is
otherwise chargeable to the State.

<B22>[<EMU>Lugar</EMU>, 457 U.S. at 937, 102 S.Ct. 2744.]

<P20>More recently, the Court reviewed the
state action doctrine and highlighted three
distinct circumstances as examples of
when a private party can be considered a
state actor: "(i) when the private entity
performs a traditional, exclusive public
function; (ii) when the government compels
the private entity to take a particular action;
or (iii) when the government acts
jointly with the private entity." <EMU>Manhattan
Cmty. Access Corp. v. Halleck</EMU>, 587 U.S.
802, 809, 139 S.Ct. 1921, 204 L.Ed.2d 405
(2019) (citations omitted).

<P20>In light of those principles, the
purpose, structure, and practical application
of New Jersey's TSL demonstrate
that private lienholders who execute tax
foreclosures may be considered state actors.

<P20>The collection of tax revenue is a
quintessential, traditional public function.
In New Jersey, like other states, real estate
taxes are the primary source of revenue
for local governments. <EMU>Cronecker</EMU>, 189
N.J. at 318, 915 A.2d 489. When property
owners
<SPage 445>
fail to make those payments, the
TSL, enacted by the State, helps fill the
void. It creates a stream of revenue that
substitutes for delinquent tax payments.
And private lienholders play an integral
role in providing that revenue pursuant to
the TSL's statutory framework.

<P20>Local government and private lienholders
have different roles under the statute,
which assigns various responsibilities to
each. Municipalities, for example, issue and
sell tax certificates, and calculate redemption
amounts. N.J.S.A. 54:5-11, -12, -19,
-31, -54. Lienholders are incentivized to
purchase the certificates by a generous
maximum interest rate. N.J.S.A. 54:5-32.
They determine whether and when to start
an action to foreclose and, as part of that
process, take the necessary steps to foreclose
on delinquent properties. N.J.S.A.
54:5-86, -97.1. Lienholders on their own,
however, cannot facilitate the collection of
delinquent property taxes or create an alternate
stream of revenue for the town
under the TSL; nor can they transfer title
through a tax foreclosure. Local government
and private lienholders act jointly in
that regard. <EMU>See Lugar</EMU>, 457 U.S. at 937,
102 S.Ct. 2744; <EMU>Manhattan</EMU>, 587 U.S. at 809,
139 S.Ct. 1921. And their interdependent
actions flow from the statutory scheme the
State created &mdash; the TSL. <EMU>See Lugar</EMU>, 457
U.S. at 937, 941, 102 S.Ct. 2744.

<P20>By working in tandem under that
framework, local government, as the Nebraska
Supreme Court has observed, effectively
"delegate[s] to ... private investors
the common governmental function of
seizing properties to satisfy a tax debt."
<EMU>Cont'l Res. v. Fair</EMU> (<EMU>Fair II</EMU>), 317 Neb. 391,
10 N.W.3d 510, 523 (2024).

<P20>For those reasons, private lienholders
acting pursuant to the TSL can be considered
state actors.

<CN>C.

<P20>Plaintiff also argues that any equity
foreclosed in this case was not taken for a
public use. Plaintiff therefore submits that
<Page 1193>
a tax foreclosure would not run afoul of the
Fifth Amendment, which
<SPage 446>
bars the taking
of private property "<EMU>for public use</EMU>,
without just compensation." <EMU>U.S. Const.</EMU>
amend. V (emphasis added). Plaintiff raises
the same argument under the State
Constitution. <EMU>See N.J. Const.</EMU> art. I, &para; 20
("Private property shall not be taken for
public use without just compensation ...
first made to the owners.").

<P20>The argument is self-defeating
because "[a] purely private taking could
not withstand the scrutiny of the public
use requirement; it would serve no legitimate
purpose of government and would
thus be void." <EMU>Haw. Hous. Auth. v. Midkiff</EMU>,
467 U.S. 229, 245, 104 S.Ct. 2321, 81
L.Ed.2d 186 (1984). Even if just compensation
is paid, "one person's property may
not be taken for the benefit of another
private person without a justifying public
purpose." <EMU>Thompson v. Consol. Gas Utils.
Corp.</EMU>, 300 U.S. 55, 80, 57 S.Ct. 364, 81
L.Ed. 510 (1937).

<P20>If a lienholder or anyone else therefore
took surplus equity in property for a <EMU>private</EMU>
use, they could not keep it. In other
words, if this case did involve a private
use, plaintiff could not hold onto potentially
hundreds of thousands of dollars in equity
that far exceeded the roughly $33,000
it was owed.

<P20>In any event, the TSL does
serve a public purpose: it enables municipalities,
in essence, to collect taxes. <EMU>See
Sonderman v. Remington Constr. Co., Inc.</EMU>,
127 N.J. 96, 109, 603 A.2d 1 (1992) ("The
primary purpose of the Law is ... to
provide a method for collecting taxes.");
<EMU>Varsolona</EMU>, 180 N.J. at 617, 853 A.2d 865
("[T]he public policy in this State is to
encourage tax sale foreclosure so as to
assist municipalities in the collection of
delinquent taxes." (quoting <EMU>Lonsk v. Pennefather</EMU>,
168 N.J. Super. 178, 182, 402
A.2d 259 (App Div. 1979))); <EMU>Bron v. Weintraub</EMU>,
42 N.J. 87, 91, 199 A.2d 625 (1964)
("Contrary to early hostility to [tax] titles,
the policy today is to support them, thereby
to aid municipalities in raising revenue."
(citing the TSL at N.J.S.A. 54:5-85)).
And by creating an alternate stream of
revenue for delinquent taxes, and providing
for tax foreclosures by private lienholders,
the TSL enables municipalities "to
obtain the payment of ... taxes without
going into the real estate business." <EMU>Varsolona</EMU>,
180 N.J. at 618, 853 A.2d 865
<SPage 447>
(quoting <EMU>Fidelity Union Tr. Co. v. City
of Newark</EMU>, 11 N.J. Super. 205, 208, 77
A.2d 820 (Cnty. Ct. 1950)). Raising revenue
under the TSL is therefore designed
to contribute to the public's general welfare;
it is not a taking for a private purpose.

<P20>The public character of a taking under
the TSL is not diminished by the fact that
property may be transferred directly to a
private entity. <EMU>See Midkiff</EMU>, 467 U.S. at 244,
104 S.Ct. 2321 ("[G]overnment does not
itself have to use property to legitimate
the taking; it is only the taking's purpose,
and not its mechanics, that must pass scrutiny
under the Public Use Clause."); <EMU>see
also Kelo v. City of New London</EMU>, 545 U.S.
469, 482, 125 S.Ct. 2655, 162 L.Ed.2d 439
(2005) (reaffirming <EMU>Midkiff</EMU>).

<CN>D.

<P20>Other recent rulings have applied <EMU>Tyler</EMU>
in similar situations. In 2022, the Nebraska
Supreme Court initially upheld a tax certificate
scheme that allowed private lienholders
to obtain title to tax-delinquent
properties. <EMU>Cont'l Res. v. Fair</EMU> (<EMU>Fair I</EMU>), 311
Neb. 184, 971 N.W.2d 313, 316 (2022). The
Court's ruling, among other things, rejected
a claim that the homeowners were entitled
to compensation for surplus equity in
their property under the Takings Clause.
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 323-26. Shortly after <EMU>Tyler</EMU> was issued,
the United States Supreme Court
granted certiorari in <EMU>Fair I</EMU>, vacated the
judgment, and remanded the case "for further
<Page 1194>
consideration in light of <EMU>Tyler</EMU>." ___ U.S.
___, 143 S. Ct. 2580, 216 L.Ed.2d
1191 (2023).

<P20>On remand, the Nebraska Supreme
Court reaffirmed its earlier conclusion that
the issuance of a tax deed was not for a
private purpose. <EMU>Fair II</EMU>, 10 N.W.3d at 517.
But the Court reconsidered its finding that
homeowners were not entitled to just compensation.
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at 518. In a detailed opinion,
the Court found that homeowners had a
protected property interest in the surplus
value of their foreclosed property beyond
the tax debt. <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> The Court also found
that private lienholders qualified as state
actors when they "obtained a tax deed to
... property" in light of their "joint action
<SPage 448>
with governmental entities." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 522.
As a result, the Court concluded that the
private lienholder in the case "was not
entitled to judgment" on the homeowner's
"claim for just compensation under the
Takings Clause." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 526.

<P20>On the same day the Nebraska Supreme
Court decided <EMU>Fair II</EMU>, it also issued a
ruling in <EMU>Nieveen v. TAX 106</EMU>, 317 Neb.
425, 10 N.W.3d 365 (2024). The United
States Supreme Court had earlier vacated
and remanded <EMU>Nieveen</EMU> in light of <EMU>Tyler</EMU>.
___ U.S. ___, 143 S. Ct. 2580, 216
L.Ed.2d 1191 (2023).

<P20><EMU>Nieveen</EMU> likewise involved a Takings
Clause challenge to the issuance of a tax
deed under Nebraska's statutory scheme.
Relying heavily on its analysis in <EMU>Fair II</EMU>,
the Nebraska Supreme Court held that the
homeowner had adequately alleged a violation
of her Fifth Amendment rights. 10
N.W.3d at 370-71.

<CN>VII.

<P20>We hold that the version of the
TSL in effect before 2024 runs counter to
the principles outlined in <EMU>Tyler</EMU> and violates
the Takings Clause of the Fifth
Amendment.

<P20>The Takings Clause, by its
very terms, is designed to prevent the
taking of "private property ... for public
use, without just compensation." <EMU>U.S.
Const.</EMU> amend. V. As a result, lienholders
are entitled to recover debts they are owed
&mdash; the value of tax sales certificates they
purchased at public auction along with interest
and related costs. But they are not
entitled to surplus equity in property that
exceeds that amount. To the extent the
prior version of the TSL deviates from
those principles, it does not survive constitutional
scrutiny. Property owners challenging
a tax foreclosure on direct review
therefore have a plausible claim for the
value of property taken from them beyond
the debt they owe.

<P20>Because we resolve this case based on
the Fifth Amendment, which applies to the
States through the Fourteenth Amendment,
we need not consider whether different
language in the State
<SPage 449>
Constitution
provides greater protection to property
owners. <EMU>See N.J. Const.</EMU> art. I, &para; 20.<fnr4>
<Page 1195>

<CN>VIII.

<P20>For the reasons outlined above, we affirm
as modified the judgment of the Appellate
Division.

<P20>JUSTICES PATTERSON, WAINER
APTER, FASCIALE, and NORIEGA join
in CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER's opinion.
JUSTICE PIERRE-LOUIS did not
participate.
<FN>
<fnt1> As discussed further below, <EMU>Rule</EMU> 4:50-1 provides,
in part, that "the court may relieve a
party ... from a final judgment or order for
the following reasons: ... (e) ... it is no
longer equitable that the judgment or order
should have prospective application; or (f)
any other reason justifying relief from the
operation of the judgment or order."

<fnt2> Plaintiff contends that <EMU>Balthazar v. Mari,
Ltd.</EMU>, 301 F. Supp. 103 (N.D. Ill.), <EMU>aff'd</EMU>, 396
U.S. 114, 90 S.Ct. 397, 24 L.Ed.2d 307
(1969), demonstrates tax foreclosure schemes
like the TSL are constitutional. <EMU>Balthazar</EMU> primarily
involved a due process challenge to the
"sale of tax delinquent real estate" under
Illinois law. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 104-05. In a footnote, the
district court stated that case law relating to
just compensation was "inapplicable." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at
105 n.6. The Supreme Court summarily affirmed
the district court without issuing an
opinion. 396 U.S. 114, 90 S.Ct. 397.

<P20><EMU>Tyler</EMU> does not mention <EMU>Balthazar</EMU>. To the
extent plaintiff argues that the district court's
opinion and the Court's summary affirmance
are at odds with <EMU>Tyler</EMU>, <EMU>Tyler</EMU> controls.

<fnt3> Because Roberto's claim is on direct review
before this Court, we need not determine
whether full retroactivity is warranted in other
cases. For that reason, we decline to address
or adopt the appellate court's analysis
of that issue. <EMU>See Roberto</EMU>, 477 N.J. Super. at
363, 307 A.3d 19. We also do not decide a
related question amicus Pacific Legal Foundation
has raised: whether a party may file a
claim for just compensation alone when a
foreclosure has been finalized and a taking of
equity has already occurred, but the taking is
within the relevant statute of limitations. <EMU>See
State v. O'Driscoll</EMU>, 215 N.J. 461, 479, 73 A.3d
496 (2013) (noting that, in general, an amicus
cannot expand the issues on appeal); <EMU>State v.
Gandhi</EMU>, 201 N.J. 161, 191, 989 A.2d 256
(2010) (same).

<fnt4> Amici raise other arguments that this case
does not present. For that reason, we do not
address them. <EMU>See O'Driscoll</EMU>, 215 N.J. at 479,
73 A.3d 496. Specifically, we make no finding
about whether today's ruling extends to in
rem foreclosures of abandoned property &mdash; an
issue the Attorney General, citing <EMU>Texaco, Inc.
v. Short</EMU>, 454 U.S. 516, 102 S.Ct. 781, 70
L.Ed.2d 738 (1982), has raised. Nor do we
address the Attorney General's thoughtful argument
that the entity that forecloses and
takes surplus equity should be required to pay
any just compensation due, rather than a
"non-foreclosing" municipality. Finally, we
decline to address Invest Newark's request
that the Court adopt a rebuttable presumption
that no equity exists in vacant, abandoned, or
deteriorating properties. Those issues are best
resolved in later disputes among adverse parties.

<P20><dgn>JUSTICE</dgn> <author>WAINER APTER</author> delivered
the opinion of the Court.
<SPage 456>
[MT]
<P20>In 1991, Celestine Payne poisoned her
husband Alphonso Payne to collect his
$39,000 life insurance policy. She then enlisted
her children and a tenant who lived
with her family, Eugene Cooper, to help
<Page 1199>
her dump Alphonso's body on the side of a
road.

<P20>Two years later, Celestine convinced
Cooper to name her the beneficiary of a
life insurance policy in his name. Then, she
had him stabbed with her kitchen knife.
When Cooper did not die, Celestine went
to the hospital, pretended to be his mother,
and signed a do-not-resuscitate order
(DNR).

<P20>Celestine next enlisted her daughter
Wendy Payne to pose as Wendy's best
friend, 18-year-old Tara Carter, to obtain a
life insurance policy on Tara naming Celestine
as the beneficiary. In 1995, she solicited
Wendy's boyfriend, Charles Pinchom,
to bludgeon
<SPage 457>
Tara to death. She
and Pinchom stuffed Tara's body into a
sleeping bag and dumped her in a park.

<P20>After serving 26 years in prison for murder
and other crimes, Celestine petitioned
for release under the Compassionate Release
Act (CRA or Act), N.J.S.A. 30:4-123.51e.
The trial court found she had
satisfied the Act's medical and public safety
requirements. But the court denied her
petition, finding, among other things, that
her crimes involved "particularly heinous,
cruel, or depraved conduct" and therefore
satisfied the first "extraordinary aggravating
factor" set forth in <EMU>State v. A.M.</EMU>, 252
N.J. 432, 460, 286 A.3d 660 (2023).

<P20>The Appellate Division reversed, concluding
that the trial court had abused its
discretion in finding that Celestine's
crimes were extraordinarily heinous, cruel,
or depraved.

<P20>We disagree. The trial court's finding
that Celestine's crimes were extraordinarily
heinous, cruel, and depraved was supported
by substantial evidence in the record,
and the trial court's application of
extraordinary aggravating factor one was
not an abuse of discretion. In addition, in
denying Celestine's petition for compassionate
release, the trial court appropriately
considered significant mitigating factors
raised by Celestine alongside the extraordinary
aggravating factors raised by the
State.

<P20>We therefore reverse the Appellate Division's
judgment. We do not reach the other
extraordinary aggravating factors relied
on by the trial court or discussed by the
parties. We similarly do not reach the
State's alternative argument that Celestine
did not satisfy the CRA's public safety
requirements.

<CN>I.

<CN>A.

<P20>In 1997, Celestine<fnr1> pled guilty to two
counts of first-degree murder, two counts
<Page 1200>
of conspiracy to commit murder, one count
of
<SPage 458>
first-degree attempted murder, three
counts of hindering apprehension, two
counts of forgery, and other crimes. She
was sentenced to two concurrent life terms
with 30 years' parole ineligibility plus a
consecutive 20-year term. The following
facts are taken from the presentence report
and testimony at the CRA hearing.

<P20>In the late 1980s, Celestine wanted "to
get rid of her husband." She unsuccessfully
tried to procure a gun to shoot him. She
also solicited Cooper to shoot him, but
Cooper refused.

<P20>In 1991, Celestine poisoned her husband
in order to collect his $39,000 life insurance
policy. She had Cooper and her children,
then ages 14 to 20, help her put her husband's
body in a large box and dump him
on the side of the road.

<P20>Celestine next convinced Cooper to take
out a life insurance policy naming her as
the beneficiary. Once the policy was in
place, she offered Pinchom $60,000 to kill
Cooper. When Pinchom, who had recently
been released from prison, refused, Celestine
told him that Cooper was molesting
Wendy. In September 1994, she
<SPage 459>
handed
Pinchom a kitchen knife and told him to
take Cooper "somewhere dark and stab
him in the neck."

<P20>Pinchom stabbed Cooper and left him on
the street to die. But Cooper survived.
While Cooper was in the hospital in critical
condition, Celestine went to the hospital,
pretended to be his mother, and signed a
DNR.

<P20>Two months later, Celestine instructed
Wendy to impersonate her best friend
Tara and take out a $25,000 life insurance
policy on Tara, again naming Celestine as
the beneficiary. Tara had grown up with
the Payne family. The two families vacationed
together, the children went to
school together, and Tara respected and
loved Celestine like a mother. After Tara's
family moved to Georgia, Tara decided
that she wanted to move back to New
Jersey. She and her family arranged that
she would move in with Celestine and
Wendy.

<P20>With the fraudulent life insurance policy
in hand, Celestine repeatedly pressured
Pinchom to kill Tara, offering him a portion
of the proceeds. He initially refused.

<P20>Then Tara learned from Wendy that
Celestine had poisoned Alphonso. Celestine
had also offered Tara $10,000 to act as
her alibi in an arson &mdash; Celestine planned
to collect $538,000 in insurance money by
having Pinchom blow up her house. Tara
told her sister Rosie Carter that she felt
uncomfortable living with Celestine. Tara
and Rosie made plans for Tara to move out
of the house.

<P20>On March 3, 1995, the day before Tara
was supposed to move out, Celestine called
Pinchom. While Tara sat at the kitchen
table, Celestine handed Pinchom a crowbar,
and said "now is your chance." Pinchom
then struck Tara in the back of the
head four or five times, bludgeoning her to
death. Together, Celestine and Pinchom
stuffed Tara's body into a sleeping bag and
dumped her in Paterson's Eastside Park.
After joggers discovered Tara's body, Celestine
and her children lied to police to
cover up the crimes.
<SPage 460>

<P20>At Celestine's sentencing, the court
found several aggravating factors, including
factor one: that Celestine's offenses
were "committed in an especially heinous,
cruel, or depraved manner," N.J.S.A.
2C:44-1(a)(1).
<Page 1201>

<CN>B.

<P20>In November 2021, when she was 71
years old, Celestine petitioned the court
for compassionate release.

<P20>Celestine attached a Certificate of Eligibility,
certifying that she suffered from a
permanent physical incapacity under
N.J.S.A. 30:4-123.51e(d)(2) and was therefore
"medically eligible for consideration
for Compassionate Release." The parties
do not dispute that Celestine suffers from
a permanent physical incapacity under the
CRA. We therefore do not discuss her
serious medical conditions, or her permanent
physical incapacity, in this opinion.

<P20>The court convened a CRA hearing and
heard multiple days of testimony from doctors,
representatives of Celestine's family,
representatives of Tara's family, and Celestine
herself.

<P20>Dr. Sandra Braimbridge, the medical director
at Edna Mahan Correctional Facility,
where Celestine is incarcerated, testified
about Celestine's medical conditions
and explained that she had been living in
the infirmary since 2021. Dr. Braimbridge
testified that she knew Celestine "very
well" and found her to be a "respectful"
and "delightful human being."

<P20>Dr. James Cassidy, the clinician supervisor
of mental health at Edna Mahan, testified
that Celestine was "psychologically
stable" and at a "very low risk" to commit
any crime. He stated that Celestine's behavior
at Edna Mahan was "exemplary,"
and she was "loved by her peers" in the
prison.

<P20>Celestine testified that she had taken
every course offered at Edna Mahan. She
explained that she had zero infractions
while incarcerated and had been active in
church and employed in the commissary
and in the sewing program until she was
no longer physically able. Celestine apologized
repeatedly for her crimes.
<SPage 461>

<P20>Two of Celestine's children and two of
her grandchildren testified that they loved
Celestine, communicated with her frequently,
and would visit and support her if
she were released.

<P20>For the State, Rosie testified that Celestine
manipulated the Carter family to gain
their trust by feigning care for Tara, who
was "18 and vulnerable." Tara's daughter,
Banisha Curry,<fnr2> who was two years old
when her mother was murdered, testified
that she lived "a life of ... grief and ...
pain," and had difficulty trusting people
because of how Celestine manipulated
Tara's trust. Curry feared Celestine
"would mastermind ... another plot
against someone else in the family." Curry
further stated that Celestine's apology at
the CRA hearing was the first made to her
or any member of Tara's family.

<CN>C.

<P20>In its decision, the trial court detailed
the above evidence. It found all witnesses,
other than Celestine, "credible and sincere."
The court discussed our opinions in
<EMU>State v. A.M.</EMU> and <EMU>State v. F.E.D.</EMU>, 251 N.J.
505, 279 A.3d 406 (2022), at length. It then
denied Celestine's petition for compassionate
release.

<P20>As an initial matter, the court found that
Celestine met the medical and public safety
conditions set forth in the Act. The
court also acknowledged that Celestine
"had no infractions" while incarcerated,
was "compliant with prison rules" and got
along "well with other inmates." It noted
Celestine's work history in prison and the
courses Celestine completed, "including relating
to healing one's self, understanding
domestic violence, managing anger, victim
focus," and more. The court recognized
that Celestine "expressed remorse for all
of her crimes" and "insist[ed] that she
<Page 1202>
profoundly regretted what she had done."
It acknowledged that Celestine would be
eligible for parole in March 2025. And the
court documented Celestine's plan to live
with her daughter, "a
<SPage 462>
skilled and experienced
nurse," who the court was "satisfied
... would take good and loving care"
of Celestine.

<P20>Yet the court denied Celestine's petition
for compassionate release, relying on our
holding in <EMU>A.M.</EMU>, 252 N.J. at 460, 286 A.3d
660, that a CRA petition may be denied if
"one or more extraordinary aggravating
factors exist." The court stressed the "heinous
cruelty" of Celestine's crimes (factor
one), "the vulnerability of each victim"
(factor two), and the intense harm that
release would cause Rosie and Curry (factor
four).

<P20>As to extraordinary aggravating factor
one, the court found Celestine's crimes to
be "extraordinarily cruel and vicious." The
court noted how Tara, who was "living on
her own and vulnerable," was "viciously
beaten to death with a crowbar," and that
"[t]his terrible and horrendously evil crime
was motivated by the hope of financial
gain." The court similarly recounted that
Cooper, who was "autistic and vulnerable,"
was repeatedly stabbed and left for dead.
When he did not die, Celestine "went to
the hospital, claimed that she was his
mother, and instructed the doctors to implement
a [DNR]. This was vicious, cold-hearted
and cruel...." The court concluded
that Celestine's "horrible crimes were
committed over a substantial period of
time, between September 1991 and March
1995" and involved "significant planning."

<P20>As to extraordinary aggravating factors
two and four, the court emphasized the
vulnerability of both Tara and Cooper, and
how Rosie and Curry would be profoundly
and grievously harmed if Celestine were
released.

<CN>D.

<P20>Celestine appealed. The Appellate Division
reversed and remanded, concluding
that the trial court "engaged in an inappropriate
exercise of judicial discretion
when it denied [Celestine] compassionate
release."

<P20>As to extraordinary aggravating factor
one, the Appellate Division concluded that
"the facts found by the trial court undoubtedly
<SPage 463>
establish a basis for a finding of
aggravating factor one" at sentencing.
However, the appellate court explained, to
justify denying compassionate release, the
aggravating factors must "rise to the level
of extraordinary." In the court's view,
"[t]he tragic facts presented here &mdash; premeditation,
blunt force trauma, and monetary
gain &mdash; are often present in first-degree
murder cases." According to the
Appellate Division, "characterizing the trial
court's findings on [factor one] as extraordinary
would create `de facto categorical
barriers to release,'" contrary to this
Court's decision in <EMU>A.M.</EMU>, 252 N.J. at 459,
286 A.3d 660.

<P20>The Appellate Division also disagreed
with the trial court's application of extraordinary
aggravating factor four. It did not
discuss extraordinary aggravating factor
two. The Appellate Division instructed the
trial court to grant Celestine's petition for
compassionate release.

<CN>E.

<P20>We granted the State's motion to stay
Celestine's release and its petition for certification.
256 N.J. 440, 310 A.3d 10 (2024).
We also granted leave to appear as amici
curiae to the Attorney General of New
Jersey (Attorney General), the American
Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey
(ACLU), and the Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers of New Jersey (ACDL).
<Page 1203>

<CN>II.

<CN>A.

<P20>The State argues that "the Appellate
Division failed to apply the abuse of discretion
standard and instead substituted its
own judgment, based on review of a cold
record, for that of the trial court." The
State contends that under the correct standard
of review, it "cannot be said that the
trial court's determination that defendant
engaged in particularly heinous, cruel, or
depraved conduct rested on an impermissible
basis, was made without a rational
explanation, or inexplicably departed from
established
<SPage 464>
principles." The State emphasizes
the trial court's "detailed factual
findings regarding defendant's conduct,"
including that: "defendant's three (3) homicidal
acts were committed over a period of
several years" and "involved significant
planning"; the crimes against Cooper and
Tara were "particularly vicious"; Celestine
"dumped" two bodies; and Celestine "pretended
to be [Cooper's] mother in an attempt
to fraudulently convince doctors
that it was his family's wish that he not be
resuscitated."

<P20>The Attorney General agrees that the
Appellate Division "substituted its judgment
for that of the trial court." The Attorney
General likewise details why this is
"not just another murder case": Celestine
"committed two successful murders and
attempted a third, executed a multi-year
plan where she solicited others &mdash; including
her own children &mdash; to help murder those
closest to her in a protracted insurance-fraud
scheme, and employed particularly
brutal methods of killing and exhibited
grave disrespect to the remains." The Appellate
Division wrongly minimized those
facts, the Attorney General maintains, reducing
Celestine's "breathtaking[ly] cruel[]
and brutal[]" crimes to "premeditation,
blunt force trauma, and monetary
gain."

<CN>B.

<P20>Celestine contends that the Appellate
Division correctly reversed the trial court's
determination. According to Celestine,
<EMU>A.M.</EMU> "made clear that extraordinary aggravating
factors should permit denial only
in an extremely limited subset of cases."
In other words, "extraordinary must mean
extraordinary," and, as the Court held in
<EMU>A.M.</EMU>, a finding of extraordinary aggravating
factors must be "exceptional and rare"
(quoting 252 N.J. at 461, 286 A.3d 660).
Regarding the first extraordinary aggravating
factor, Celestine maintains that a defendant's
conduct must be "uniquely heinous"
to justify denial of compassionate
release.

<P20>Celestine also submits that because
"[o]ur courts have <EMU>never</EMU> considered aggravating
factors without also considering
mitigating factors," courts must "consider
not only whether extraordinary
<SPage 465>
aggravating factors warrant denial but
also whether mitigating factors warrant
granting release." Celestine avers that had
the trial court properly considered the
"abundance of mitigating factors" she presented,
it would have granted her release.

<P20>The ACLU agrees with Celestine that
"except in rare and exceptional cases, to
effectuate the will of the Legislature,
courts should grant compassionate release
to people who satisfy the medical and public
safety requirements of the Act." The
ACLU likewise agrees that "[a]ny analysis
of aggravating factors must necessarily
also include evaluation of mitigating factors."
Such mitigating factors might include
whether "the petitioner is otherwise
parole eligible, has completed unusual programming,
or demonstrated a noteworthy
personal transformation." The ACDL
highlights the financial burden on the Department
of Corrections (DOC) in providing
"around-the-clock medical care to a
<Page 1204>
person who has proven she does not pose a
threat to the public safety."

<CN>III.

<CN>A.

<P20>We review a trial court's decision
to grant or deny compassionate release for
abuse of discretion. <EMU>A.M.</EMU>, 252 N.J. at 442,
286 A.3d 660. Although we did not specify
in <EMU>A.M.</EMU> the standard of review for application
of an extraordinary aggravating factor,
we now hold that such findings are
also reviewed for abuse of discretion. That
keeps with both the standard applied to
determinations regarding the CRA's statutory
factors, <EMU>see ibid.</EMU>, and the standard
applied to a trial court's finding of aggravating
or mitigating factors at sentencing,
<EMU>see State v. Miller</EMU>, 237 N.J. 15, 19, 203
A.3d 102 (2019).

<P20>In determining whether a trial
court abused its discretion in applying a
particular extraordinary aggravating factor,
we thus will consider whether the
application of the factor was "based upon
competent credible evidence in the record,"
and whether the trial court "clearly
erred by reaching a conclusion that could
not
<SPage 466>
have reasonably been made." <EMU>State
v. Roth</EMU>, 95 N.J. 334, 364, 366, 471 A.2d 370
(1984).

<CN>B.

<P20>This is our third time reviewing the
Compassionate Release Act, which was enacted
in 2020. As we thoroughly detailed in
<EMU>State v. F.E.D.</EMU>, the Act repealed the former
Medical Parole Statute in order to
"reduce capacity[] and alleviate financial
strains [on the DOC] while getting medically
vulnerable residents the care they
need outside of prison." 251 N.J. at 522,
279 A.3d 406 (quoting Off. of the Governor,
<EMU>Press Release: Governor Murphy Signs
Sentencing Reform Legislation</EMU> (Oct. 19,
2020)).

<P20>The CRA does so in part by vesting
authority to grant compassionate release
in the courts, rather than the New Jersey
State Parole Board, and by removing a
provision from the former statute that had
prohibited individuals convicted of murder
and other serious crimes from applying for
release. <EMU>See</EMU> N.J.S.A. 30:4-123.51e(e);
N.J.S.A. 30:4-123.51c(a)(3) (repealed 2020);
<EMU>F.E.D.</EMU>, 251 N.J. at 521, 523 n.6, 279 A.3d
406.

<P20>To petition a court for compassionate
release, an inmate must first obtain a Certificate
of Eligibility based on a medical
diagnosis, made by two licensed physicians,
that she has a terminal condition or
a permanent physical incapacity. N.J.S.A.
30:4-123.51e(b), (d)(2). The Act provides
that for an inmate who has a permanent
physical incapacity, "the court may order"
compassionate release "if the court finds
by clear and convincing evidence that the
inmate is ... permanently physically incapable
of committing a crime if released
and ... the conditions established ... under
which the inmate would be released
would not pose a threat to public safety."
<EMU>Id.</EMU> at (f)(1). Victims and their family members
must be notified if a petition for
compassionate release is filed. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at (e)(2).
They are also entitled to testify at a hearing
"concerning any harm suffered by the
victim or family member." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>In <EMU>State v. A.M.</EMU>, we considered whether
a trial court has "discretion to deny compassionate
release if an inmate satisfies
the Act's medical and public safety conditions."
252 N.J. at 451, 286
<SPage 467>
A.3d 660.
Relying in part on the use of the word
"may" rather than "shall" in N.J.S.A. 30:4-123.51e(a)
and (f)(1), and in part on the
requirement in subsection (e)(2) that
judges "hear a victim's testimony about
any harm they have suffered," we held
that the CRA "cannot be read to require
courts to grant compassionate release" if
<Page 1205>
the medical and public safety conditions
are met. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 454-56, 286 A.3d 660.

<P20>We then turned to how trial courts
should exercise their discretion. We held
that "courts may not exercise discretion in
a way that creates de facto categorical
barriers to release and overrides legislative
intent." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 459, 286 A.3d 660. Instead,
inmates who meet "the Act's medical
and public safety criteria should be
granted compassionate release unless one
or more extraordinary aggravating factors
exist." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 460, 286 A.3d 660. We gave
several examples of what trial courts "may
consider" as extraordinary aggravating
factors, including "whether an offense involved
any of the following extraordinary
circumstances:"

<B22>(1) particularly heinous, cruel, or depraved
conduct; (2) a particularly vulnerable
victim, based on the person's
advanced age, youth, or disability; (3) an
attack on the institutions of government
or the administration of justice; and (4)
whether release would have a particularly
detrimental effect on the well-being
and recovery process of victims and family
members.

<B22>[<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>]

<P20>We noted that those extraordinary aggravating
factors were "draw[n] from the
goals of the CRA" and from sentencing
provisions in the Criminal Code. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 460
& n.6, 286 A.3d 660 (citing N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(1)
to (2)). We concluded that the standard
to find an extraordinary aggravating
factor was "a necessarily high one" and
was "limited to exceptional and rare circumstances
to comport with the statute's
goal of increasing the use of compassionate
release." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 460-61, 286 A.3d 660.

<CN>IV.

<CN>A.

<P20>We hold that the trial court did not
abuse its discretion in finding that Celestine's
conduct was exceptionally heinous,
cruel, or depraved and in therefore denying
compassionate release.
<SPage 468>

<P20>The Appellate Division minimized
Celestine's conduct, dismissing it as "premeditation,
blunt force trauma, and monetary
gain," and held that all three "are
often present in first-degree murder
cases." At oral argument, counsel for Celestine
similarly characterized these facts
as "ordinary" in cases of first-degree murder.

<P20>We disagree. The trial court's finding
that Celestine's crimes were "particularly
heinous, cruel, or depraved," <EMU>A.M.</EMU>,
252 N.J. at 460, 286 A.3d 660, is amply
supported by the record. Indeed, Celestine's
overall course of criminal conduct
between 1991 and 1995 was breathtakingly
heinous, cruel, and depraved. It was also
calculated, devious, and brutal.

<P20>As the trial court recounted in detail,
Celestine first murdered her husband by
poisoning him, and then enlisted her children
and Cooper, her autistic tenant, to
dump his body on the side of the road to
make his death appear accidental. She
then collected his life insurance proceeds.

<P20>Two years later, Celestine convinced
Cooper to take out a life insurance policy
listing her as the beneficiary. When Pinchom
initially refused to kill Cooper, Celestine
manipulated him by claiming that
Cooper was molesting Wendy. She then
handed Pinchom her kitchen knife and told
him to take Cooper "somewhere dark and
stab him in the neck." While Cooper was
hospitalized, Celestine pretended to be his
mother and signed a DNR.

<P20>Next, Celestine directed Wendy to impersonate
Tara to take out yet another
fraudulent life insurance policy naming
Celestine as the beneficiary. Celestine then
handed Pinchom a crowbar and directed
him to bludgeon Tara to death. She and
Pinchom dumped Tara's body in a park.
<Page 1206>

<P20>The trial court concluded that all those
crimes, committed over a "substantial period
of time between" 1991 and 1995, were
"extraordinarily cruel and vicious," "horrendously
evil," "cold-hearted and cruel,"
"motivated by the hope of financial gain,"
and involved "significant planning." That
conclusion was not an abuse of discretion.
<SPage 469>

<P20>In reaching this holding, we do
not accept the Attorney General's suggestion,
made at oral argument, that a finding
that aggravating factor one applies at sentencing
will generally preclude compassionate
release. At sentencing, the first
aggravating circumstance asks courts to
consider "[t]he nature and circumstances
of the offense, and the role of the actor in
committing the offense, including whether
or not it was committed in an especially
heinous, cruel, or depraved manner."
N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(a)(1). The extraordinary
aggravating factor for purposes of compassionate
release requires the court to
determine whether the offense involved
"particularly heinous, cruel, or depraved
conduct." <EMU>A.M.</EMU>, 252 N.J. at 460, 286 A.3d
660.

<P20>The language is similar, but not the
same. And we specifically held in <EMU>A.M.</EMU> that
a finding of any extraordinary aggravating
factor is "limited to exceptional and rare
circumstances," and the burden on the
State is "a necessarily high one." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at
460-61, 286 A.3d 660. We also held that
courts may not create "de facto categorical
barriers" to compassionate release. <EMU>Id.</EMU> at
459, 286 A.3d 660. Any rule that a particular
finding at sentencing will automatically
prevent compassionate release could be
such a categorical bar that would "override[]
legislative intent." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>However, we do consider some case
law interpreting aggravating factor one at
sentencing to be instructive. In the sentencing
context, we have held that "an
application of aggravating factor one must
be premised upon factors independent of
the elements of the crime and firmly
grounded in the record." <EMU>State v. Fuentes</EMU>,
217 N.J. 57, 63, 85 A.3d 923 (2014). In
other words, "a sentencing court must
scrupulously avoid `double-counting' facts
that establish the elements of the relevant
offense." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 74-75, 85 A.3d 923.

<P20>In <EMU>State v. McGuire</EMU>, the defendant shot
and killed her husband; cut his body into
sections and placed each section into a
garbage bag and then a luggage set; drove
to Virginia; threw the suitcases over the
Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel and into
the water; and immediately "embarked on
a plan to conceal [her] crimes." 419
<SPage 470>
N.J.
Super. 88, 107-08, 16 A.3d 411 (App. Div.
2011). The sentencing court applied aggravating
factor one, finding defendant's actions
"over a three-week period spanning
four different states ... reflected a willfulness
and a malice that goes far beyond the
elements of the crime of murder in our
law." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 159, 16 A.3d 411. The Appellate
Division concluded that the trial court did
not abuse its discretion, noting "that the
crimes were the result of a cold, calculated
plan carried out with shocking attention to
detail and callous disregard for the life of a
human being." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 159-60, 16 A.3d 411.

<P20>We hold similarly in this appeal. The
trial court's analysis of extraordinary aggravating
factor one in this case reflected
no impermissible double-counting of the
elements of first-degree murder. And it
did not rely on facts common to many
first-degree murder cases.

<P20>Instead, as we required in <EMU>A.M.</EMU>, the trial
court found the facts of this case truly
"exceptional and rare." 252 N.J. at 461, 286
A.3d 660. We agree. Celestine killed by
preying on the trust of those closest to her
&mdash; including her victims, her family members,
and others she ensnared. She manipulated
people to commit fraud and to brutally
kill and injure on her behalf. She
dumped two bodies. When one of her victims
did not die, she impersonated his
<Page 1207>
mother to try to ensure he did. She did all
of this through elaborate scheming, involving
significant preparation, over a period
of many years. Taken together, the trial
court did not abuse its discretion in finding
that these facts rise to the level of extraordinary,
exceptional, and rare.

<P20>We do not suggest that any one
fact is dispositive or will always support a
finding of particularly cruel, heinous, or
depraved conduct to satisfy extraordinary
aggravating factor one. Instead, we trust
that trial courts will carefully consider all
the facts to determine whether extraordinary
aggravating factor one has been met,
in light of the Legislature's intent to "increas[e]
the use of compassionate release."
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>
<SPage 471>

<CN>B.

<P20>Because the trial court's finding on extraordinary
aggravating factor one was
sufficient to deny compassionate release,
we do not reach the other extraordinary
aggravating factors relied upon by the
court or discussed by the parties. We likewise
do not reach the State's alternative
grounds for reversal.

<CN>C.

<P20>We agree with Celestine and the
ACLU that if a trial court considers extraordinary
aggravating factors raised by
the State in opposing compassionate release,
it must also consider significant mitigating
factors raised by an inmate that
point in favor of release. Yet we decline to
remand because the trial court did consider
mitigating evidence here.

<P20>We had no occasion to consider
mitigating factors in <EMU>A.M.</EMU> But in other
areas of the law, our courts do not consider
aggravating factors without also considering
mitigating factors. At sentencing,
"[m]itigating factors that are called to the
court's attention should not be ignored,"
and any that are "supported by credible
evidence" "must be found." <EMU>State v. Case</EMU>,
220 N.J. 49, 64, 103 A.3d 237 (2014) (internal
quotations omitted). Similarly, before
the Legislature abolished the death penalty,
courts reviewing the proportionality of
a death sentence evaluated both aggravating
and mitigating factors. <EMU>See, e.g.</EMU>, <EMU>State
v. Bey</EMU>, 137 N.J. 334, 350, 645 A.2d 685
(1994).

<P20>The mitigating factors the Legislature
has set forth for courts to consider
at sentencing, N.J.S.A. 2C:44-1(b)(1) to
(14), may not be relevant at a compassionate
release hearing years later. But other
mitigating evidence may weigh strongly in
favor of compassionate release, such as a
petitioner's conduct in prison, including
lack of disciplinary infractions and involvement
in work, courses, or other activities;
testimony from those who know the person
well about their extraordinary adjustment
to prison life or
<SPage 472>
personal transformation;
strong family or community support;
and more.

<P20>The trial court considered such
evidence here. Recall that the trial court
quoted testimony from Dr. Braimbridge
and Dr. Cassidy that Celestine was a "respectful"
and "delightful human being,"
whose behavior at Edna Mahan was "exemplary"
and who was "loved by her
peers." The court catalogued the many
courses Celestine took while incarcerated
and her long work history. It acknowledged
her activities with the prison
church. It recognized that Celestine had
zero infractions during her decades-long
incarceration. It documented how Celestine
"expressed remorse for all of her
crimes," and "insist[ed] that she profoundly
regretted what she had done." It described
Celestine's strong support from
her children and grandchildren, and it
found that Celestine's daughter "would
take good and loving care of her." Yet it
still denied compassionate release, implicitly
<Page 1208>
finding none of that could overcome
Celestine's extraordinarily cruel, heinous,
and depraved conduct. We discern no
abuse of discretion in that conclusion.

<P20>In summary, in petitioning a
court for compassionate release, the inmate
bears the burden of proving she
meets the Act's medical and public safety
requirements. If the State relies on one or
more extraordinary aggravating factors to
then oppose compassionate release, petitioners
can present significant mitigating
factors that point in favor of release, which
the trial court must consider. The existence
of mitigating factors alone, however,
cannot establish that an individual is entitled
to compassionate release.

<CN>V.

<P20>The judgment of the Appellate Division
is therefore reversed, and the order of the
trial court denying compassionate release
is reinstated.

<P20>CHIEF JUSTICE RABNER and
JUSTICES PATTERSON, PIERRE-LOUIS,
FASCIALE, and NORIEGA join
in JUSTICE WAINER APTER's opinion.
<FN>
<fnt1> The CRA states that "information contained
in the petition [for compassionate release]
and the contents of any comments submitted
by a recipient in response ... shall be confidential
and shall not be disclosed to any person
who is not authorized to receive or review
the information or comments." N.J.S.A. 30:4-123.51e(e)(4).
As we noted in <EMU>A.M.</EMU>, the CRA
"does not expressly address testimony in open
court at a hearing on a petition." 252 N.J. at
447, 286 A.3d 660. Nor does it address judicial
opinions. In <EMU>A.M.</EMU>, we held that if a CRA
opinion describes a defendant's medical condition,
"it cannot identify the defendant by
name." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>; <EMU>see also State v. F.E.D.</EMU>, 251
N.J. 505, 536, 279 A.3d 406 (2022). We therefore
identified one petitioner by name, without
discussing his specific medical condition,
and identified the second petitioner by initials.
<EMU>A.M.</EMU>, 252 N.J. at 448, 286 A.3d 660.

<P20>Here, Celestine repeatedly waived CRA confidentiality
before the trial court. The court
nonetheless used initials for Celestine and all
her relatives because of the "abundance of
medical details" in the opinion. The Appellate
Division adopted the same practice. In this
opinion, we do not include information about
Celestine's medical conditions. We therefore
use first names for Celestine and all members
of the Payne family. We also use first names
for Tara Carter and her sister, Rosie Carter.
We mean no disrespect in doing so. For those
who do not share the last name Payne or
Carter, we use last names. We continue to call
on the Legislature to review the CRA's confidentiality
provision and provide instruction
on how courts should handle use of CRA
petitioners' names, including in judicial opinions.
<EMU>See ibid.</EMU>

of Ms. Curry's name.

[MT]
<P20>These compensation cases, calendared
back-to-back and consolidated for purposes
of this opinion, present a novel issue:
whether a judge of compensation was required
to recuse herself from presiding
over a matter involving the application of a
statute for which the judge was a sponsor
in her prior capacity as a member of the
Legislature.

<P20>By leave granted, respondent Township
of Ocean School District appeals from two
orders of the Division of Workers' Compensation:
the February 21, 2024 order
denying its motion for recusal of the assigned
judge of compensation; and the
March 14, 2024 order finding decedent<fnr1>
was an essential employee during the period
of occupational exposure to COVID-19.
Having considered respondent's
<SPage 244>
contentions
in light of the record and applicable
law, we affirm both orders.

<P20>Decedent was a full-time teacher in respondent's
intermediate school. After ceasing
in-person instruction because of the
COVID-19 pandemic, the school reopened
on February 8, 2021, and decedent returned
to work. She became ill and died on
May 18, 2021, of respiratory failure as a
result of COVID-19.

<P20>Petitioner filed a dependency claim with
the Division alleging decedent suffered an
occupational disease when she contracted
COVID-19 during the period of occupational
exposure and died as a result of the
disease. Respondent answered that decedent's
exposure to COVID-19 did not arise
out of or in the course of her employment.

<P20>Petitioner moved for an order declaring
decedent entitled to a presumption she
was an essential employee as provided by
N.J.S.A. 34:15-31.11 and .12, which respondent
opposed. Upon the assigned judge's
retirement, the matter was transferred to
Judge of Compensation Joann Downey,
whom respondent moved to recuse.

<CN>I.

<P20>We first address whether a judge of
compensation is required to recuse herself
from presiding over a matter involving the
application of a statute for which the judge
was a sponsor in her prior capacity as a
member of the Legislature. Judge Downey
was a member of the New Jersey Assembly
from 2016 to 2020. In that role, she
was one of eight sponsors of Senate Bill
2380, which was passed by the Legislature
<Page 1215>
on July 30, 2020, and approved by the
Governor on September 14, 2020. The bill
amended the workers' compensation statute
to create a rebuttable presumption
that an essential employee's contraction of
COVID-19 during the state of emergency
was work-related. <EMU>See</EMU> N.J.S.A. 34:15-31.11
and .12.

<P20>In denying respondent's motion to recuse,
the judge first addressed its contention
she prejudged the case. The judge
acknowledged
<SPage 245>
that in conferencing with
the attorneys, she expressed her opinion of
what she believed to be an essential employee.
The judge stated her "job" during
conferences was to speak frankly with the
attorneys and discuss "where [she was]
going" based on "the law and the facts that
have so far been presented to [her] during
those conferences."

<P20>The judge then addressed her role as a
legislator:

<B42>So, at that time yes, I was a sponsor
of this bill which concerns the employment
benefits and [COVID-19] infections
contracted by essential employees. But
being an assembly member on a bill as
far as I can see from any of the Rules of
Judicial Conduct and including the fact
that I tried to look [at] ... what cases
there were available to see if there was
any reasoning whatsoever that ...
would make me specifically not permitted
to be able to sit in this matter
because of any undue prejudice and I
know that I don't have any undue prejudice.

<P20>The judge then addressed potential bias:

<B42>I have no personal knowledge of the
facts, of the actual disputed facts. The
only thing that I have knowledge of is
the law and the law making&mdash;I don't
think that's extrajudicial knowledge. I
think that's judicial knowledge. It's my
understanding basically as a person
who's here sitting before you and I'm
supposed to interpret the law it's best to
know about the law and it's best to be
able to read the law and be able to take
in all the facts and then apply the facts
to the law. That's what I intend to do in
this case as I have with any other case
I've had before me so far.

<P20>On appeal, respondent argues the
judge should have granted its recusal motion
to avoid the appearance of bias. "[R]ecusal
motions are `entrusted to the sound
discretion of the judge and are subject to
review for abuse of discretion.'" <EMU>Goldfarb
v. Solimine</EMU>, 460 N.J. Super. 22, 30, 213
A.3d 200 (App. Div. 2019) (quoting <EMU>State v.
McCabe</EMU>, 201 N.J. 34, 45, 987 A.2d 567
(2010)), <EMU>aff'd as modified and remanded on
other grounds</EMU>, 245 N.J. 326, 245 A.3d 570
(2021).

<P20>New Jersey court rules do not directly
control the actions of workers' compensation
judges. <EMU>Waters v. Island Transp.
Corp.</EMU>, 229 N.J. Super. 541, 550, 552 A.2d
205 (App. Div. 1989). Nevertheless, the
code of conduct for judges of compensation
is based on the New Jersey Code of Judicial
Conduct. <EMU>Code of Conduct for Judges
of Comp.</EMU> pmbl., N.J.A.C. 12:235-10 app.
Judges of compensation are required to
perform their duties impartially and to

disqualify themselves in proceedings
where "their impartiality or the appearance
of their impartiality might reasonably
be questioned." <EMU>Id.</EMU> r. 3.16(B). The applicable
standard as defined in the Compensation
Code is whether "a reasonable, fully
informed person [would] have doubts
about the judge's impartiality." <EMU>Id.</EMU> r. 3.16
cmt. 2.

<P20>This standard also refers to <EMU>DeNike v.
Cupo</EMU>, where our Supreme Court concluded:

<B22>Indeed, as this Court recognized nearly
a half century ago, "`justice must satisfy
the appearance of justice.'" <EMU>State v.
Deutsch</EMU>, 34 N.J. 190, 206 [168 A.2d 12]
(1961) (quoting <EMU>Offutt v. United States</EMU>,
<Page 1216>
348 U.S. 11, 14 [75 S.Ct. 11, 99 L.Ed. 11]
(1954)). That standard requires judges
to "refrain ... from sitting in any
causes where their objectivity and impartiality
may fairly be brought into
question." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU> In other words, judges
must avoid acting in a biased way or in a
manner that may be <EMU>perceived</EMU> as partial.
To demand any less would invite
questions about the impartiality of the
justice system and thereby "threaten[]
the integrity of our judicial process."

<P20>Our decision in <EMU>Panitch v. Panitch</EMU>,
339 N.J. Super. 63, 66-67, 770 A.2d
1237 (App. Div. 2001), provides guidance
on how a Superior Court judge should
decide a motion for recusal:

<B42>It is improper for a judge to withdraw
from a case upon a mere suggestion that
he [or she] is disqualified "unless the
alleged cause of recusal is known by him
[or her] to exist or is shown to be true in
fact." <EMU>Hundred E. Credit Corp. v. Eric
Schuster Corp.</EMU>, 212 N.J. Super. 350, 358
[515 A.2d 246] (App. Div. 1986). The
challenged judge who hears the motion
should clearly set forth the "objective
and subjective bases for the ultimate
decision." <EMU>Magill v. Casel</EMU>, 238 N.J. Super.
57, 65 [568 A.2d 1221] (App. Div.
1990). In construing the analogous federal
statute on judicial disqualification,
Justice Kennedy stated in a concurring
opinion that "[i]f through obduracy, honest
mistake, or simple inability to attain
self[-]knowledge the judge fails to acknowledge
a disqualifying predisposition
or circumstance, an appellate court must
order recusal no matter what the
source." <EMU>Liteky v. United States</EMU>, 510
U.S. 540, 563 [114 S.Ct. 1147, 127
L.Ed.2d 474] (1994) (Kennedy, J., concurring).

face a judge where there is reasonable
question of impartiality...." <EMU>Alexander
v. Primerica Holdings, Inc.</EMU>, 10 F.3d 155,
162 (3d Cir. 1993).

<B42>It is unnecessary to prove actual prejudice
on the part of the court, but rather
"the mere appearance of bias may require
disqualification.... However, before
the court may be disqualified on the
ground of an appearance of bias, the
belief that the proceedings were unfair
must be objectively reasonable." <EMU>State v.
Marshall</EMU>, 148 N.J. 89, 279 [690 A.2d 1]
(1997).
<SPage 247>

<B22>[(Third alteration in original) (citations
reformatted).]

<P20>We have not directly addressed whether
a former legislator who later became a
compensation judge may rule on a matter
that concerns the application of a statute
that the judge sponsored while in the Legislature.
However, other jurisdictions have
considered this issue with regard to federal
judges. For example, in <EMU>Limeco, Inc. v.
Division of Lime</EMU>, 571 F. Supp. 710, 711
(N.D. Miss. 1983), a federal judge recused
himself based on his involvement in a legislative
process over forty years earlier
because of the appearance of partiality.
Eighteen years later, the Sixth Circuit disagreed:

<B42>We decline to hold that <EMU>Limeco</EMU> correctly
states a rule of mandatory recusal
and believe the weight of authority to
the contrary to be far more persuasive.
We hold that a judge who, as a legislator,
sponsored or voted for legislation
implementing or favoring the death penalty
cannot be presumed to be disqualified
from reviewing capital cases as a
judge. Establishing a rule that a judge
must recuse himself in cases involving
legislation that had been enacted when a
judge served as a legislator would force
recusal in an inordinate amount of cases.
In addition, it might prevent individuals
<Page 1217>
who are or were legislators from serving
as members of the judiciary and from
bringing their unique perspectives to the
bench....

<B42>Moreover, such a rule does not comport
with 28 U.S.C. &sect; 455(a), which
states that a judge "shall disqualify himself
in any proceeding in which his impartiality
might reasonably be questioned."
This rule requires a fact-specific
analysis of the judge's prior activity, legislative
or otherwise, to determine if disqualification
is required.

<B22>[<EMU>Buell v. Mitchell</EMU>, 274 F.3d 337, 347 (6th
Cir. 2001).]

<P20>In his concurring opinion in <EMU>Liteky</EMU>, 510
U.S. at 557-58, 114 S.Ct. 1147, Justice Kennedy
described the basis for a federal
judge to grant a motion for recusal:

<B42>Section 455(a) provides that a judge
"shall disqualify himself in any proceeding
in which his impartiality might reasonably
be questioned." For present
purposes, it should suffice to say that
&sect; 455(a) is triggered by an attitude or
state of mind so resistant to fair and
dispassionate inquiry as to cause a party,
the public, or a reviewing court to
have reasonable grounds to question the
neutral and objective character of a
judge's rulings or findings. I think all
would agree that a high threshold is
required to satisfy this standard. Thus,
under &sect; 455(a), a judge should be disqualified
only if it appears that he or she
harbors an aversion, hostility or disposition
of a kind that a fair-minded person
could not set aside when judging the
dispute.

<P20>We agree with this approach
here. A compensation judge who formerly
sponsored a bill enacted into law is not per
se
<SPage 248>
disqualified from presiding over
cases implicating or interpreting that law.
"A judge ordinarily is not disqualifiable
because of his [or her] own life experiences."
<EMU>Johnson v. Salem Corp.</EMU>, 189 N.J.
Super. 50, 60, 458 A.2d 1290 (App. Div.
1983). "[E]ach of us is a product of the
aggregate of our experiences, and our understanding
is enhanced by the totality of
our experiences." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 60-61, 458 A.2d
1290. Thus, a judge's personal knowledge
of or experience with certain legislative
history does not necessarily render the
judge biased or unable to make a fair
judgment in the matter.

<P20>Rather, the judge must determine
whether a reasonable person would doubt
the judge's impartiality, given the judge's
prior involvement in the legislative proceedings
and the issues and facts presented
in the case before the judge. We are
satisfied that Judge Downey did not abuse
her discretion in deciding a recusal was
unwarranted in this case. Her knowledge
of the law and lawmaking was not extrajudicial
knowledge but rather judicial knowledge
that many judges take with them to
the bench. In addition, her comments during
conferences were based on her application
of the statute, as it was enacted, to the
facts presented to her at that time.

<P20>Respondent also argues that the
judge, as a former sponsor of the bill,
could be called as a witness and therefore
should not have decided the matter. We
are unpersuaded by this speculative contention.
While a court may look to legislative
history, including the sponsors' statements,
to shed light on an ambiguous
statute, individual legislators are typically
not subject to examination as to how they
personally interpreted the statute. That is
because we are not interested in the
statement of one legislator as to what he
or she believed was the correct interpretation
of a statute. <EMU>See DiProspero v.
Penn</EMU>, 183 N.J. 477, 499, 874 A.2d 1039
(2005).
<Page 1218>

<CN>II.

<P20>We next turn to respondent's
appeal of the order declaring decedent an
essential employee. "Appellate review of
<SPage 249>
workers' compensation cases is `limited
to whether the findings made could have
been reached on sufficient credible evidence
present in the record ... with due
regard also to the agency's expertise[.]'"
<EMU>Hersh v. Cnty. of Morris</EMU>, 217 N.J. 236,
242, 86 A.3d 140 (2014) (alteration in original)
(quoting <EMU>Sager v. O.A. Peterson
Constr., Co.</EMU>, 182 N.J. 156, 163-64, 862 A.2d
1119 (2004)). "Nonetheless, the judge of
compensation's legal findings are not entitled
to any deference and, thus, are reviewed
de novo." <EMU>Id.</EMU> at 243, 86 A.3d 140.

<P20>Petitioner's motion sought an order declaring
decedent an essential employee.
N.J.S.A. 34:15-31.11 (emphasis added) defines
an essential employee as

<B22>an employee in the public or private
sector who, during a state of emergency:

<B42>(1) is a public safety worker or first
responder, including any fire, police or
other emergency responders;

<B42>(2) is involved in providing medical
and other healthcare services, emergency
transportation, social services, and
other care services, including services
provided in health care facilities, residential
facilities, or homes;

<B42>(3) performs functions which involve
physical proximity to members of the
public and are essential to the public's
health, safety, and welfare, including
transportation services, hotel and other
residential services, financial services,
and the production, preparation, storage,
sale, and distribution of essential
goods such as food, beverages, medicine,
fuel, and supplies for conducting essential
business and work at home; or

<B42>(4) <EMU>is any other employee deemed an
essential employee by the public authority
declaring the state of emergency.</EMU>

<B42>An employee who is an employee of
the State who is offered the option of
working at home but has refused that
option shall not be regarded as an essential
employee.

<P20>Petitioner sought the order because essential
employees who contracted COVID-19
are entitled to "a rebuttable presumption
that the contraction of the disease is
work-related and fully compensable for the
purposes of benefits provided under
[N.J.S.A.] 34:15-1 [to -6], ordinary and accidental
disability retirement, and any other
benefits provided by law to individuals
suffering injury or illness through the
course of their employment." N.J.S.A.
34:15-31.12. The "presumption may be rebutted
by a preponderance of the evidence
showing that the worker was not
<SPage 250>
exposed to the disease while working in
the place of employment other than the
individual's own residence." <EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>In determining decedent was an essential
employee, the judge found the following
facts. On March 9, 2020, Governor
Murphy issued Executive Order (EO) 103,
declaring a public health emergency and
state of emergency in New Jersey as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. <EMU>Exec.
Order No. 103</EMU> (Mar. 9, 2020), 52 N.J.R.
549(a) (Apr. 6, 2020). EO 103 authorized
the State Office of Emergency Management
(OEM), in conjunction with the New
Jersey Department of Health (DOH), to
take any actions necessary to protect the
health and welfare of New Jersey citizens.
<EMU>Ibid.</EMU>

<P20>On March 16, 2020, the Governor issued
EO 104, closing all schools in New Jersey.
<EMU>Exec. Order No. 104</EMU> (Mar. 16, 2020), 52
N.J.R. 550(a) (Apr. 6, 2020). On August 13,
2020, the Governor signed EO 175, which
superseded the prior EOs requiring
schools to remain closed and allowed
schools to reopen for in-person instruction
subject to health and safety protocols.
<Page 1219>
<EMU>Exec. Order No. 175</EMU> (Aug. 13, 2020), 52
N.J.R. 1699(a) (Sept. 21, 2020).

<P20>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency (CISA), an agency of the
United States Department of Homeland
Security, issued guidance as to who should
be considered essential employees; kindergarten
through twelfth-grade teachers
were included in the list. CISA, <EMU>Guidance
on the Essential Critical Infrastructure
Workforce: Ensuring Community and National
Resilience in COVID-19 Response</EMU>
10 (version 4.0 Aug. 18, 2020). CISA's essential
employee guidelines were adopted
by OEM. <EMU>Essential Employees</EMU>, <EMU>OEM</EMU>,
https://nj.gov/njoem/programs/essential-employees.shtml
(last visited Nov. 18,
2024).<fnr2>
<SPage 251>

<P20>In addition, on October 16, 2020,
DOH promulgated a COVID-19 vaccination
plan which identified "education and
child-care workers" as essential employees.
N.J. Dep't of Health, <EMU>COVID-19 Vaccination
Plan</EMU> 43 (version 1 Oct. 16, 2020).
On June 4, 2021, Governor Murphy signed
EO 244 ending the COVID-19 public
health emergency. <EMU>Exec. Order No. 244</EMU>
(June 4, 2021), 53 N.J.R. 1131(a) (July 6,
2021).

<P20>Based on the foregoing, the judge found
decedent, as a teacher in public middle
school, was an essential employee.

<P20>Respondent argues the judge erred because
there were genuine issues of material
facts as to whether teachers should be
considered essential employees pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 34:15-31.11 because the statute
does not specifically or implicitly include
them. Respondent points out that at the
time of its enactment, New Jersey schools
were closed and learning occurred virtually.

<P20>We disagree with this narrow
reading of the statute because it ignores
section (4), which extends the definition of
essential employees to include "any other
employee deemed an essential employee
by the public authority declaring the state
of emergency." Thus, even if the statute
did not identify teachers as essential employees,
it nevertheless encompassed any
other employee the governing authority
deemed essential. Teachers were deemed
essential employees through the Governor's
delegation of the responsibility to
protect the public to OEM, and OEM's
adoption of CISA's list of essential employees,
which included teachers.

<P20>This determination is further buttressed
by EO 175, which permitted the reopening
of schools because "in-person instruction
provides students with academic, social,
emotional, and mental health supports that
cannot be provided with the same level of
efficacy in a remote setting" and "is critical
in facilitating the social and emotional
health of students." <EMU>Exec. Order No. 175</EMU>,
52 N.J.R. at 1699. As a result of EO 175,
schools reopened while there was still a
public health emergency in place.
<SPage 252>

<P20>Respondent further argues that
the judge erred because there is no provision
for summary decisions in workers'
compensation court, yet she summarily
found decedent was an essential employee
based on "nothing but [the judge's] personal
beliefs" regarding the statute. According
to respondent, petitioner's motion
lacked any competent evidentiary materials,
because he provided no evidence or
affidavits other than his attorney's certification,
which included conclusory arguments.
Respondent also contends petitioner
did not provide a statement of material
facts, a requirement for summary decisions
according to <EMU>Rule</EMU> 4:46-2(a) and <EMU>Brill</EMU>
<Page 1220>
<EMU>v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America</EMU>,
142 N.J. 520, 666 A.2d 146 (1995).

<P20>We are unpersuaded by respondent's
arguments. Petitioner sought a
declaratory judgment as to a limited aspect
of the matter. A party to a workers'
compensation dispute may obtain "a declaration
of rights" pursuant to the Declaratory
Judgment Act (DJA), N.J.S.A. 2A:16-50
to -62. <EMU>See Weir v. Mkt. Transition
Facility of N.J.</EMU>, 318 N.J. Super. 436, 442-43,
723 A.2d 1231 (App. Div. 1999).
N.J.S.A. 2A:16-53 permits a person to seek
a "declaration of rights, status or other
legal relations" when that person's rights
or status are affected by a statute. "A
declaratory action ... is proper provided
there is a justiciable controversy, the party
claiming the relief has standing, and there
are no adequate or appropriate alternative
remedies." <EMU>Lab. Ready Ne., Inc. v. Dir.,
Div. of Tax'n</EMU>, 25 N.J. Tax 607, 612 (Tax
2011) (citing <EMU>Registrar & Transfer Co. v.
Dir., Div. of Tax'n</EMU>, 157 N.J. Super. 532,
538-43, 385 A.2d 268 (Ch. Div. 1978)).

<P20>Personal affidavits were not necessary
to decide whether decedent was an essential
employee because there was no disagreement
she was a full-time teacher in
respondent's school district and the issue
was not determined on facts specific to
decedent. In addition, <EMU>Rule</EMU> 4:46-2(a) permits,
but does not require, the court to
dismiss a motion for summary judgment
for failure to file a statement of material
facts. Because the judge's decision here
turned on statutory interpretation and
analysis of public documents,
<SPage 253>
the lack of
a statement of material facts was not fatal
to the application and the judge did not
abuse her discretion in considering the
application absent the statement.

<P20>Lastly, we note the presumption under
N.J.S.A. 34:15-31.12 that an essential employee's
"contraction of the disease [was]
work-related and fully compensable" is rebuttable.
Thus, notwithstanding the
judge's declaratory finding that decedent
was an essential employee, respondent
may introduce evidence to rebut the presumption
that decedent's contraction of
COVID-19 was work-related.

<P20>Affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt1> Decedent was petitioner Giuseppe Amato's
wife, Denise Amato.

<fnt2> The version of OEM's website published at
the time of the judge's decision referred to
version 4.0 of CISA's guidance, which was in
effect at the time decedent returned to work.
The current version of OEM's website refers
to version 4.1 of CISA's guidance.

[MT]
<P20>On December 15, 2023, the Commonwealth
Court issued a "Rule to Show
Cause Why Action Should Not Be Dismissed
for Failure to Prosecute" pertaining
to Appellant Leon D. Bodie's Petition
for Review. Receiving no timely response,
the court issued an order dismissing Appellant's
petition. It appears that Appellant
did not receive timely notice of the Commonwealth
Court's December 15, 2023
Rule to Show Cause, and the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, Department of
Corrections, indicates no opposition to remanding
this case for further proceedings.
Accordingly, this 17th day of December,
2024, the Commonwealth Court order dismissing
Leon D. Bodie's Petition for Review
at Commonwealth Court docket 683
MD 2020 is <EMB>VACATED.</EMB> The case is <EMB>REMANDED</EMB>
with direction to the Commonwealth
Court to give Appellant a full and
fair opportunity to file a response to the
court's Rule to Show Cause dated December
15, 2023. This Court's jurisdiction is
relinquished.

<P20>OPINION BY <author>STEVENS</author>, <dgn>P.J.E.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Appellant Robert Franklin Mucci appeals
<EM>pro se</EM> from the December 29, 2023,
order entered in the Court of Common
Pleas of Elk County, which denied his
"Motion to Vacate Defendant's Illegal SVP
Designation and Lifetime Registration Requirements
Imposed under Megan's Law
III." After a careful review, we affirm.

<P20>This Court has previously set forth the
relevant facts and procedural history, in
part, as follows:

<B42>The record of this case includes [Appellant]
having entered pleas of guilty to
two counts of aggravated indecent assault[-complainant
less than 13 years
old], 18 Pa.C.S.A. [&sect;] 3125(a)(7), and one
count of sexual abuse of children, 18
Pa.C.S.A. [&sect;] 6312(b), all graded as second
degree felonies, on August 18, 2011.
[Appellant admitted he committed the
crimes on or about August 29, 2009.]
Consequently, [Appellant] was ordered
to undergo an assessment by a member
of the Sexual Offenders Assessment
Board (SOAB) pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A.
[&sect;] 9795.4. The assessment by a member
of [the] SOAB was conducted on October
20, 2011. On November 21, 2011,
[Appellant] entered a signed stipulation
with his counsel in which he agreed that
the October 21, 2011, report of the member
of [the SOAB] provided sufficient,
clear, and convincing evidence that he
was a sexually violent predator (SVP).
[Appellant] also waived the necessity of
any SVP hearing, and [he] agreed that
the stipulation that he was an SVP could
be entered as a court order. By order of
court dated November 23, 2011[,] and
docketed November 28, 2011, [Appellant]
was found to be [an SVP] pursuant
to 42 Pa.C.S.A. [&sect;] 9795.4(e) and 42 Pa.
C.S.A. [&sect;] 9792, provisions of Megan's
Law III[,] which was in effect at that
time. [Appellant] was then sentenced on
December 22, 2011[,] in accordance with
the terms of the proposed sentence negotiated
by counsel for the Commonwealth
and [defense counsel,] Douglas
Sughrue, Esquire. In accordance with
the negotiated pleas and suggested sentences,
he was sentenced, <EM>inter alia,</EM> to
an aggregate period of incarceration of
not less than 8 [years] nor more than 27
years. The [trial] court provided [Appellant]
with a registration notice dated
December 22, 2011[,] and docketed December
27, 2011[,] stating that he was
subject to the lifetime registration requirements
<Page 1226>
of Megan's Law III including
42 Pa.C.S.A. [&sect;] 9795.1(b)(2) and 42
Pa.C.S.A. [&sect;] 9795.1(b)(3).

<B42>[On August 26, 2016, Appellant filed a]
petition for a <EM>writ</EM> of <EM>habeas corpus/writ</EM>
of <EM>coram nobis,</EM> [and a hearing] was
scheduled for February 27, 2017, but
continued until May 22, 2017. A <EM>pro se</EM>
motion for correction of the record and
issuance of a corrected DC-300B commitment
order was then filed by [Appellant]
on March 9, 2017. The hearing on
that motion was scheduled for the same
time as the continued hearing on May
22, 2017. [Appellant] then filed a petition
on May 4, 2017, withdrawing two claims
asserted in his <EM>habeas corpus</EM> petition
and requesting that the hearing be conducted
by video conference. [Appellant]
next requested a continuance of the May
22, 2017[,] hearing due to the inability of
the Department of Corrections to provide
adequate time to conduct the hearing
by video conference. The hearing
was continued until August 4, 2017[,]
and then ultimately rescheduled until
September 29, 2017.

<B42>On August 24, 2017, [Appellant] filed
an "Addendum/Supplement to Petitioner's
<EM>Habeas Corpus/Coram</EM> Petition
seeking Declaratory and Injunctive Relief
from the Retroactive Application of
SORNA." The Commonwealth filed a
motion to dismiss [Appellant's] petition
for a writ of <EM>habeas corpus</EM> on September
29, 2017, to which [Appellant] filed
an answer. [Appellant] filed a brief in
support of his <EM>habeas</EM> petition on December
8, 2017. He next filed a post-brief
submission/addendum to argument/supplemental
case authority supporting relief
requested retroactively on December
18, 2017. [Appellant] then filed a second
post brief submission on December 27,
2017. The motion for leave to supplement
the record filed by [Appellant] on
April 23, 2018[,] was granted by Order
of Court on September 7, 2018[,] and
[Appellant] was given until October 1,
2018[,] to submit any additional authority.
An amendment/supplement to the
<EM>habeas</EM> petition was filed by [Appellant]
on September 24, 2018. The October 1,
2018, date notwithstanding, [Appellant's]
"post case submissions" received and
filed on November 8, 2018[,] and December
20, 2018[,] respectively [were] also
considered.

<B42>On December 28, 2018, the trial court
entered an order denying Appellant's
petition. [Specifically, the trial court determined
Appellant's filings were untimely
petitions filed under the Post
Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.
C.S.A. &sect;&sect; 9541-9546.] Appellant did not
file an appeal from the December 28,
2018, order. Rather, Appellant filed a
petition for reconsideration on January
7, 2019, which the trial court denied on
February 15, 2019. On March 4, 2019,
Appellant filed a motion seeking the reinstatement
of his appeal rights <EM>nunc
pro tunc.</EM> On April 22, 2019, the trial
court scheduled a hearing on the motion,
and on May 23, 2019, appointed counsel
for purposes of the hearing. The trial
court held a hearing on July 29, 2019.
On October 2, 2019, the trial court entered
an order denying Appellant's motion
for reinstatement of his right to
appeal. Further, the order vacated the
limited appointment of counsel and appointed
new counsel to represent Appellant
in "any subsequent proceedings and
to address the merit, if any, of the positions
and issues promoted by [Appellant]."
Order, 10/2/19, at 2.

<B42>On October 31, 2019, newly appointed
counsel filed a motion to withdraw and a
<EMBI>Turner/Finley</EMBI>[<fnr1>] no-merit letter. On
<Page 1227>
June 18, 2020, the trial court filed a
"discussion, notice and order," ultimately
ordering that "in accordance with Pa.
R.Crim.P. 907(1), the Commonwealth
and [Appellant] are notified that to the
extent any of [Appellant's] pending
pleadings are construed as a PCRA petition,
the [c]ourt intends to dismiss such
petition." Order, 6/18/20, at 3. Also, on
June 18, 2020, the trial court filed an
order granting appointed counsel's request
to withdraw.... On July 17, 2020,
the trial court entered an order denying
any pending PCRA petitions. Appellant
filed [a notice of] appeal on August 17,
2020.

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Mucci,</EMBI> No. 876 WDA
2020, 2021 WL 2592376, at *1-4 (Pa. Super.
filed June 24, 2021) (unpublished memorandum)
(citation to record and footnote
omitted) (footnote added).

<P20>On appeal, this Court quashed Appellant's
appeal on the basis he failed to file a
timely appeal. Specifically, we held as follows:

<B42>As set forth in the recitation of the
procedural history of this case, on August
26, 2016, nearly five years after
entry of his judgment of sentence and
SVP designation, Appellant filed a petition
for <EM>writ</EM> of <EM>habeas corpus</EM> and/or
<EM>writ</EM> of <EM>coram nobis.</EM> Appellant then provided
the trial court with additional filings,
and a hearing was held on September
29, 2017. Subsequently, Appellant
filed additional pleadings with the trial
court. On December 28, 2018, the trial
court entered an order that denied Appellant's
petition, considering it to be an
untimely PCRA [petition]. However, Appellant
failed to take a timely appeal
from that order.

<C5>***

<B42>We [conclude] that the appealable order
in this matter was entered on December
28, 2018. As such, the instant
appeal, filed on August 17, 2020, is patently
untimely, and at this juncture, we
lack jurisdiction to address Appellant's
claims.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at *6-7.

<P20>Nevertheless, this Court relevantly noted
as follows in a footnote:

<B42>We note that in <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Lacombe,</EMBI> 660 Pa. 568, 234 A.3d 602
(2020), our Supreme Court recognized
the problems registrants face in challenging
changes to sex-offender-registration
statutes, and [the Court] declared
that registrants are not to be
restricted to using the PCRA as the
exclusive means for challenging their
registration requirements. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 617-18.
Consequently, if we had been presented
with a timely appeal from the final order
entered [on] December 28, 2018, pursuant
to <EMBI>Lacombe,</EMBI> we would have held
Appellant's challenge to his registration
is not subject to the PCRA's time limitations.
<EMBI>See Commonwealth v. Smith,</EMBI> 240
A.3d 654, 658 (Pa. Super. 2020) (holding
that substantive claims challenging the
application of SORNA II's lifetime registration
requirements are not cognizable
under the PCRA, and thus, not subject
to its time-bar). Hence, if we had
reached the merits of Appellant's claims,
we would have vacated the December
28, 2018, order of the trial court that
concluded Appellant's filing was an untimely
PCRA petition and remanded for
further proceedings.

<P00><EMBI>Mucci,</EMBI> No. 876 WDA 2020, *7-8 n.4.

<P20>Thereafter, Appellant filed a petition for
allowance of appeal with our Supreme
Court, which denied the petition on January
4, 2022.

<P20>On July 6, 2023, Appellant filed a <EM>pro se</EM>
motion entitled "Motion to Vacate Defendant's
Illegal SVP Designation and Lifetime
Registration Requirements Imposed
<Page 1228>
under Megan's Law III."<fnr2> On August 17,
2023, the Commonwealth filed an answer
in opposition to Appellant's motion.

<P20>On October 25, 2023, the trial court held
a hearing on Appellant's <EM>pro se</EM> motion.
During the hearing, Appellant admitted he
was deemed to be a SVP under Megan's
Law III.<fnr3> N.T., 10/25/23, at 22. However,
he argued, that Megan's Law III was void
<EM>ab initio,</EM> and, consequently, there was no
authority to impose registration, notification,
and counseling requirements upon
him. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 23. Moreover, Appellant argued
that any attempt to apply Subchapter I of
SORNA II retroactively was unconstitutional.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 22.

<P20>Furthermore, although Appellant admitted
during the October 25, 2023, hearing
that, on November 21, 2011, he signed a
stipulation agreeing that the October 21,
2011, report of the SOAB provided sufficient,
clear, and convincing evidence that
he was a SVP, and this stipulation was
entered as a court order, Appellant offered
into evidence "law reviews and some other
reports that have been generated regarding
recidivism of sexual offenders[.]" <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
19-20. Appellant averred the evidence was
necessary to address the irrebuttable presumption
of recidivism set forth in Subchapter
I, which he alleged violated his
right to reputation. Appellant did not present
any expert testimony.

<P20>By order and opinion filed on December
29, 2023, the trial court denied Appellant's
<EM>pro se</EM> motion. This timely <EM>pro se</EM> appeal
followed, and all Pa.R.A.P. 1925 requirements
have been met.

<P20>On appeal, Appellant sets forth the following
issues in his "Statement of Questions
Involved" (verbatim):

<B24>A. Whether the lower court erred by
failing to grant Appellant relief
from the void SVP designation and
lifetime registration requirements
imposed under Megan's Law III by
applying the void <EM>ab initio</EM> doctrine
to vacate them and declare them
null and void and unenforceable?

<B24>B. Whether the lower court erred by
denying Appellant an opportunity to
present scientific case studies rebutting
<Page 1229>
the irrebuttable presumption of
future dangerousness utilized by the
legislature in 42 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 9799.51(a)(2) during the evidentiary
hearing requiring a remand for
further factual development in accordance
with <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Torsilieri,</EMBI> 659 Pa. 359, 232 A.3d
567, 595 (2020), and <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Boyd,</EMBI> 287 A.3d 957, 960
(Pa. Super. 2022)?

<B24>C. Whether the lower court erred by
failing to vacate and correct Appellant's
illegal sentence <EM>sua sponte</EM>
and impose a lawful sentence under
its inherent powers of correction
pursuant to <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Holmes,</EMBI> 593 Pa. 601, 933 A.2d 57
(2007), despite the statutory timelines
limitations placed upon a trial
court's constitutional authority by
42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9545(b)(1)?

<P00>Appellant's Brief at 5 (suggested answers
omitted).

<P20>In his first issue, Appellant contends
he is challenging the "legality of his
SVP designation and the lifetime registration,
notification, and counseling requirements
(RNC) imposed upon him absent
any valid statutory authority under void
Megan's Law III[.]" Appellant's Brief at
16. He contends that his RNC requirements
were imposed under a statute (Megan's
Law III) which is void <EM>ab initio,</EM> and
any attempt to impose RNC requirements
is unconstitutional.<fnr4> Moreover, Appellant
claims any attempt to apply Subchapter I
of SORNA II retroactively to him is unconstitutional.
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 30. Additionally,
he claims an offender who was subjected
to Megan's Law III cannot lawfully be
considered an "existing registrant" under
SORNA II based upon acts rendered null
and void. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 42.

<P20>Initially, we note Appellant's claims
"raise questions of law for which our standard
of review is <EM>de novo</EM> and our scope of
review is plenary." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Torsilieri,</EMBI> 659 Pa. 359, 232 A.3d 567, 575
(2020) (citation omitted). In resolving such
claims, our Supreme Court has explained:

<B22>In addressing constitutional challenges
to legislative enactments, we are ever
cognizant that the General Assembly
may enact laws which impinge on constitutional
rights to protect the health,
safety, and welfare of society, but also
that any restriction is subject to judicial
review to protect the constitutional
rights of all citizens. We emphasize that
a party challenging a statute must meet
the high burden of demonstrating that
the statute clearly, palpably, and plainly
violates the Constitution.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (citations, quotations, and quotation
marks omitted).

<P20>On the merits, we agree with Appellant
that he is no longer subject to Megan's
Law III, as our Supreme Court struck
down that law eleven years ago. <EMBI>See Commonwealth
v. Neiman,</EMBI> 624 Pa. 53, 84
A.3d 603 (2013). We disagree, however,
with Appellant's claims that his SVP designation
cannot stand, and he may be exempt
from Subchapter I. Contrary to his
argument, the applicability of SORNA II
to his case has been settled, as the <EMBI>Lacombe</EMBI>
Court held that Subchapter I does
not constitute criminal punishment, and its
retroactive application does not violate <EM>ex</EM>
<Page 1230>
<EM>post facto</EM> concerns. <EMBI>See Lacombe, supra,</EMBI>
234 A.3d at 626-27.

<P20>Moreover, in <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Barger,</EMBI>
325 A.3d 858 (Pa.Super. filed 10/2/24), this
Court recently held as follows:

<B42>[The] appellant argues that he cannot
be required to register under Subchapter
I of SORNA II since his duty to
register as a SVP arose under Megan's
Law III, which has since been determined
to be void. [The] appellant, who
committed his qualifying offenses before
December 20, 2012, argues that Subchapter
I of SORNA cannot be retroactively
applied to him as such a designation
would be violative of <EM>ex post facto</EM>
prohibitions. However, [the] appellant
does not suggest that the RNC requirements
imposed upon him through Subchapter
I are in any way punitive.

<B42>[I]n <EMBI>Butler II,</EMBI>[<fnr5>] our Supreme Court
rejected a similar challenge to Subchapter
H of SORNA, as it found that the
RNC requirements imposed on SVPs
therein do not constitute criminal punishment.
The Court distinguished SVPs
from non-SVP registrants "due to
heightened public safety concerns based
on the determination that SVPS have a
`mental abnormality or a personality disorder
that makes the individual more
likely to engage in predatory sexually
violent offenses.'" <EMBI>Butler II,</EMBI> 657 Pa. at
604, 226 A.3d at 987 (quoting 42 Pa.
C.S.A. &sect; 9799.12).

<C5>***

<B42>We also reiterate that in <EMBI>Lacombe,</EMBI>
the Supreme Court specifically found
that Subchapter I of SORNA II "is nonpunitive
and does not violate the constitutional
prohibition against <EM>ex post facto</EM>
laws." <EMBI>Lacombe,</EMBI> 660 Pa. at 575, 234
A.3d at 605-06.

<B42>Given the same logic set forth in <EMBI>Butler
II</EMBI> and <EMBI>Lacombe,</EMBI> this Court has rejected
<EM>ex post facto</EM> challenges brought
by petitioners deemed to be SVPs under
Megan's Law III, who claimed they
should not be subject to retroactive application
of Subchapter I of SORNA II.
In <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Zack,</EMBI> 262 A.3d
497 (Pa. Super. 2021), this Court held
that the appellant, who was originally
deemed an SVP under Megan's Law III,
"must now register under Subchapter I
of SORNA II, which has less stringent
reporting requirements than the constitutionally
permissible requirements of
Subchapter H." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 505.

<B42>As a result, [the] appellant's claim
that he cannot be required to submit to
RNC requirements set forth in Subchapter
I of SORNA II is clearly meritless.
Accordingly, the trial court correctly determined
that [the] appellant is not entitled
to <EM>habeas</EM> relief.

<P00><EMBI>Barger, supra,</EMBI> 2024 WL 4367448, at *5-6
(footnotes and citation omitted) (footnote
added). <EMBI>See Commonwealth v. Moreno,</EMBI>
No. 1418-19 MDA 2024, 2024 WL 1952686
(Pa. Super. filed May 3, 2024) (unpublished
memorandum)<fnr6> (recognizing that, in <EMBI>Lacombe,</EMBI>
our Supreme Court held that the
retroactive application of Subchapter I of
SORNA II is nonpunitive and does not
violate the constitutional prohibition
against <EM>ex post facto</EM> laws).

<P20>Based on the aforementioned legal holdings,
we conclude Appellant is not entitled
to relief. While we agree with Appellant
that Megan's Law III, the statute under
which his RNC requirements were imposed,
has been voided, this does not end
<Page 1231>
our inquiry. Rather, we conclude Appellant
is subject to the RNC requirements of
Subchapter I of SORNA II, and as indicated
<EM>supra,</EM> such retroactive application is
not violative of the <EM>ex post facto</EM> clause.<fnr7>

<P20>Furthermore, we reject Appellant's
claim that an offender who was subjected
to Megan's Law III cannot lawfully be
considered an "existing registrant" under
SORNA II. We note Section 9799.55(b)(3)
of Subchapter I specifically imposes lifetime
registration on an SVP. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 42 Pa.
C.S.A. &sect; 9799.55(b)(3). An SVP, in turn, is
defined as:

<B42>[A] person who has been convicted of
a sexually violent offense and who is
determined to be a sexually violent predator
under section 9799.58 (relating to
assessments) due to a mental abnormality
or personality disorder that makes
the person likely to engage in predatory
sexually violent offenses or who has ever
been determined by a court to have a
mental abnormality or personality disorder
that makes the person likely to engage
in predatory sexually violent offenses
under a former sexual offender
registration law of this Commonwealth.

<P00>42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9799.53. Since the trial
court determined, in 2011, that Appellant
met the criteria for an SVP under Megan's
Law III, he remains an SVP for purposes
of Subchapter I. <EMBI>See Commonwealth v.
Haggerty,</EMBI> No. 1305 WDA 2023, 2024 WL
4318605 (Pa. Super. filed Sept. 27, 2024)
(unpublished memorandum) (rejecting the
appellant's claim that an offender who was
subjected to Megan's Law III cannot lawfully
be considered an "existing registrant"
under SORNA II based upon acts rendered
null and void).

<P20>In his next issue, Appellant
claims his RNC requirements, as imposed
by Subsection I of SORNA II, violate the
right to reputation<fnr8> without due process.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Appellant's Brief at 44-45. Appellant
also claims his SVP designation under
Subsection I of SORNA II creates an unconstitutional
irrebuttable presumption.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Specifically, Appellant claims that, in
Subchapter I, the General Assembly created
an unconstitutional irrebuttable presumption
by indicating that "sexually violent
predators and offenders pose a high
risk of engaging in further offenses,"
which is not universally true for all those
required to register and is not true for
him. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Initially, we note that, in <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Morgan,</EMBI> 258 A.3d 1147 (Pa.
Super. 2021), this Court held as follows:

<B42>Although an SVP designation and the
concomitant RNC requirements infringe
upon a defendant's right to reputation, it
is only after [a] detailed assessment and
hearing process that an individual may
be subject to that infringement. Upon
review, we conclude that this procedure
comports with due process and that Subchapter
I is narrowly tailored to its compelling
state purpose of protecting the
public from those who have been found
to be dangerously mentally ill. Accordingly,
we hold that SVP designations
under Subchapter I of SORNA II are
constitutional and do not violate the
right to reputation under Pennsylvania's
constitution.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 1157 (citations and quotation marks
omitted). <EMBI>See Commonwealth v. Zepprinans,</EMBI>
No. 1815 EDA 2020, 2022 WL
<Page 1232>
102632 (Pa. Super. filed Jan. 11, 2022)
(unpublished memorandum) (holding a defendant's
SVP designation under Subchapter
I of SORNA does not violate a defendant's
right to reputation).

<P20>Further, in <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Guo,</EMBI> No.
643 WDA 2023, 2024 WL 3200042 (Pa.
Super. filed June 27, 2024) (unpublished
memorandum), after analyzing <EMBI>Morgan,
supra,</EMBI> this Court examined the irrebuttable
presumption doctrine. Specifically, we
reasoned as follows:

<B42>Our Supreme Court recently issued
its disposition in <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Torsilieri,</EMBI> ___ Pa. ___, 316 A.3d 77
(2024), in which the Court considered
whether the General Assembly's determination,
in [SORNA II], that individuals
who commit sexual offenses pose a
high risk of committing additional sexual
offenses constitutes an unconstitutional
irrebuttable presumption violative of due
process, because it impairs the right to
reputation under the Pennsylvania Constitution.[<fnr9>]

<B44>Our High Court explained:

<B44>[T]he first issue before us concerns a
presumption which largely undergirds
the criminal justice system's treatment
of sex offenders: that those who
commit sexual offenses pose a high
risk to reoffend. The General Assembly
has memorialized this presumption
in its legislative findings: "Sexual offenders
pose a high risk of committing
additional sexual offenses and protection
of the public from this type of
offender is a paramount governmental
interest." 42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9799.11(a)(4).[<fnr10>]
To challenge such assumptions under
the irrebuttable presumption doctrine,
a challenging party must demonstrate:
(1) an interest protected by
the due process clause, (2) utilization
of a presumption that is not universally
true; and (3) the existence of a
reasonable alternative means to ascertain
the presumed fact.

<B22><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 79 (some internal citations omitted).

<B42>The Court noted that the parties did
not meaningfully dispute the first prong
of the doctrine&mdash;that "the right to reputation
is protected by the due process
clause and that the designation as a
sexual offender, based upon a presumption
of posing a high risk of recidivism,
impacts one's reputation." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 97 n.13.
Turning to the second prong of the irrebuttable
presumption doctrine, the
Court explained that "to meet his heavy
burden of establishing that the General
Assembly's presumption was not universally
true, [the] [a]ppellee was required
to establish that there exists a scientific
consensus that sexual offenders pose no
greater risk of committing additional
sexual crimes than other groups not subject
to similar registration laws." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
98.

<B44>The Court held:

<B44>Here, [the] [a]ppellee's own experts
concede that adult sexual offenders
reoffend at a rate of at least three
times higher than other individuals
convicted of non-sexual offenses. Accordingly,
rather than refuting it, the
evidence supports the legislative presumption;
the evidence validates the
<Page 1233>
statutory underpinnings of Subchapter
H. We need go no further. Having
reviewed arguments and the evidence
presented below, we find that the evidence
does not demonstrate a consensus
that the presumption at issue is
not universally true. Thus, we hold
[the] [a]ppellee has failed to meet his
heavy burden to demonstrate that the
irrebuttable presumption at issue was
constitutionally infirm.

<B22><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 99 (citations and footnote omitted).

<B42>Based on its disposition of the second
prong, the Court did not need to evaluate
the third prong of the irrebuttable
presumption. Nevertheless, the Court
noted that the third prong would be met
because SORNA II provides "for individualized
assessment of adult sexual offenders
as [SVPs]." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 97 n.13.

<B42>Instantly, we note at the outset that,
unlike the defendant in <EMBI>Torsilieri,</EMBI> [the]
[a]ppellant [in <EMBI>Guo</EMBI>] was designated an
SVP. Although [the] [a]ppellant claims
that his SVP status violates his right to
reputation as protected under the due
process clause, and that the presumption
of his likelihood to reoffend is not universally
true, [the] [a]ppellant offers no
reasonable alternative means to ascertain
the presumed fact. The <EMBI>Torsilieri</EMBI>
Court noted that the third prong required
to challenge the irrebuttable presumption
doctrine would be met for non-SVPs
attacking their registration requirements,
because a reasonable alternative
means to evaluate their likelihood
of re-offense would be through an individualized
assessment similar to the assessments
conducted for SVPs. <EMBI>See
Torsilieri, supra,</EMBI> at 97 n.13. [The] [a]ppellant
[in <EMBI>Guo</EMBI>] acknowledges that the
SOAB has the tools necessary to conduct
individualized assessments, but he
complains that the SOAB representative
failed to utilize those tools in [his] case.
Thus, [the] [a]ppellant is essentially
challenging the sufficiency of the evidence
for his SVP designation based on
what he alleges was an incomplete assessment
by the SOAB. In the absence
of any proffered "reasonable alternative
means to ascertain the presumed fact,"
[the] [a]ppellant's challenge to his SVP
status under the irrebuttable presumption
doctrine necessarily fails.

<B42>To the extent [the] [a]ppellant [in
<EMBI>Guo</EMBI>] is advancing any challenge to the
irrebuttable presumption doctrine that
could implicate any registration requirement
he may be subject to that falls
outside his registration requirements as
an SVP, our Supreme Court has now
expressly held that "the evidence does
not demonstrate a consensus that the
presumption at issue is not universally
true." <EMBI>Torsilieri, supra,</EMBI> at 99. [The]
[a]ppellant does not proffer any evidence
that would be inconsistent with or go
beyond that which was presented in
<EMBI>Torsilieri.</EMBI> In fact, [the] [a]ppellant's
failure to present evidence to support
his constitutional claim is reason enough
to deny relief.

<P00><EMBI>Guo, supra,</EMBI> 2024 WL 3200042, at *5-7
(footnote added) (footnotes omitted) (citations
omitted).

<P20>Here, as in <EMBI>Guo,</EMBI> we note that Appellant
was designated a SVP. Although Appellant
claims that his SVP status violates the
right to reputation as protected under the
due process clause, and that the presumption
of his likelihood to re-offend is not
universally true, Appellant offers no reasonable
alternative means to ascertain the
presumed fact. As we noted in <EMBI>Guo,</EMBI> the
High Court in <EMBI>Torsilieri</EMBI> held the third
prong required to challenge the irrebuttable
presumption doctrine would be met for
non-SVPs attacking their registration requirements
because a reasonable alternative
means to evaluate their likelihood of
re-offense would be available through an
individualized assessment similar to the
assessments conducted for SVPs.
<Page 1234>

<P20>However, in the case <EM>sub judice,</EM> the
SOAB conducted an individualized assessment
of Appellant. While Appellant may
challenge whether the SOAB considered
all evidence, this is essentially a challenge
to the sufficiency of the evidence for his
SVP designation. As we held in <EMBI>Guo,</EMBI> "in
the absence of any proffered reasonable
alternative means to ascertain the presumed
fact," Appellant's challenge to his
SVP status in the case <EM>sub judice</EM> fails
under the irrebuttable presumption doctrine.
<EMBI>Guo, supra,</EMBI> 2024 WL 3200042, at *5-6.

<P20>In his final claim, Appellant avers
that, just as the PCRA is not the exclusive
procedural mechanism for challenging sexual
offender registration statutes, the
PCRA is not the exclusive procedural
mechanism for challenging the alleged illegality
of his term of imprisonment and/or
the voluntariness of his plea. Thus, Appellant
avers the trial court erred in concluding
his attempt to raise the issues was
brought forth in an untimely PCRA petition.<fnr11>

<P20>As indicated <EM>supra,</EM> in <EMBI>Lacombe,</EMBI>
our Supreme Court held that Subchapter I
of SORNA II does not constitute criminal
punishment and expressly "decline[d] to
find the PCRA, or any other procedural
mechanism, is the exclusive method for
challenging sexual offender registration
statutes[.]" <EMBI>Lacombe, supra,</EMBI> 234 A.3d at
618, 626. Accordingly, SORNA registrants
seeking relief from such requirements are
not required to do so in a timely-filed
PCRA petition. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 617-18. However,
contrary to Appellant's assertion, we
conclude the PCRA court properly treated
Appellant's purported legality of sentencing
claim, as well as his challenge to the
voluntariness of his plea, as claims falling
under the auspices of the PCRA.<fnr12>

<P20>It is well-settled the PCRA is
"the sole means of obtaining collateral relief,"
and "if the underlying substantive
claim is one that could potentially be
remedied under the PCRA, that claim is
exclusive to the PCRA." <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Pagan,</EMBI> 864 A.2d 1231, 1233 (Pa. Super.
2004) (emphasis omitted). Moreover, "[i]ssues
that are cognizable under the PCRA
must be raised in a timely PCRA petition
and cannot be raised in a <EM>habeas corpus</EM>
petition [or other self-styled petition outside
of the PCRA]." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Taylor,</EMBI> 65 A.3d 462, 466 (Pa. Super. 2013).

<P20>Here, Appellant challenges the legality
of his sentence on the basis the trial court
did not have the statutory authority to
impose a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.<fnr13>
He also avers the trial
<Page 1235>
court's sentence exceeds the statutory limits
because the trial court imposed consecutive
sentences in addition to the mandatory
minimum term of imprisonment. He
also generally avers his guilty plea was
involuntarily entered since it was unlawfully
induced.

<P20>Appellant's self-styled petition purports
to raise legality of sentencing claims,
as well as challenges to the voluntariness
of his guilty plea. Both of these claims are
cognizable under the PCRA and subject to
the PCRA timeliness provisions. <EMBI>See Commonwealth
v. Moore,</EMBI> 665 Pa. 95, 247 A.3d
990 (2021) (holding claims implicating legality
of sentence must be raised under
the auspices of the PCRA); 42 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 9543(a)(2)(iii) (indicating a defendant is
eligible for PCRA relief where he alleges
"[a] plea of guilty unlawfully induced
where the circumstances make it likely
that the inducement caused the petitioner
to plead guilty and the petitioner is innocent.").
Accordingly, as did the PCRA
court below, we deem this portion of Appellant's
<EM>pro se</EM> motion to be a serial
PCRA petition. Thus, we proceed to determine
whether it was timely filed under the
PCRA.

<B42>Pennsylvania law makes clear no
court has jurisdiction to hear an untimely
PCRA petition. The most recent
amendments to the PCRA, effective
January 16, 1996, provide a PCRA petition,
including a second or subsequent
petition, shall be filed within one year of
the date the underlying judgment becomes
final. 42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9545(b)(1). A
judgment is deemed final "at the conclusion
of direct review, including discretionary
review in the Supreme Court of
the United States and the Supreme
Court of Pennsylvania, or at the expiration
of time for seeking the review." 42
Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9545(b)(3).

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Monaco,</EMBI> 996 A.2d 1076,
1079 (Pa. Super. 2010) (citations omitted).

<B42>[There are] three statutory exceptions
to the timeliness provisions in the PCRA
[that] allow for the very limited circumstances
under which the late filing of a
petition will be excused. 42 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 9545(b)(1). To invoke an exception, a
petitioner must allege and prove:

<B42>(i) the failure to raise the claim previously
was the result of interference by
government officials with the presentation
of the claim in violation of the Constitution
or laws of this Commonwealth
or the Constitution or laws of the United
States;

<B42>(ii) the facts upon which the claim is
predicated were unknown to the petitioner
and could not have been ascertained
by the exercise of due diligence;
or

<B42>(iii) the right asserted is a constitutional
right that was recognized by the
Supreme Court of the United States or
the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after
the time period provided in this section
and has been held by that court to
apply retroactively.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 1079-80 (citing 42 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii)).

<P20>Under this framework, an appellant
must either file a petition within one
year of his judgment of sentence becoming
final under Section 9545(b)(3), or "plead"
and "prove" that one of the enumerated
exceptions apply. "[T]here is no generalized
equitable exception to the jurisdictional
one-year time bar pertaining to post-conviction
petitions." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Brown,</EMBI> 596 Pa. 354, 943 A.2d 264, 267
(2008).

<P20>In the case <EM>sub judice,</EM> Appellant does
not dispute that his instant petition, filed
on July 6, 2023, was not filed within one
year from the date his judgment of sentence
became final, <EM>i.e.,</EM> in January of 2012,
thirty days after he failed to file a direct
appeal to this Court. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 42 Pa.C.S.A.
<Page 1236>
&sect; 9545(b)(3); Pa.R.A.P. 903(a). Further, although
under limited circumstances a petitioner
may invoke a timeliness exception
under which the late filing of a petition will
be excused, Appellant does not present or
develop any argument related to the timeliness
exceptions. Instead, he contends the
PCRA court erred in treating his <EM>pro se</EM>
document as a PCRA petition subject to
the timeliness requirements. As indicated
<EM>supra,</EM> the PCRA court did not err in this
regard.<fnr14>

<P20>Accordingly, for the aforementioned reasons,
we affirm the December 29, 2023,
order. However, upon remand of the record,
we direct the lower court to notify
Appellant of his registration requirements
under Subchapter I.<fnr15>

<P20>Order affirmed. Case remanded with instructions.
Jurisdiction relinquished. Application
for relief denied.

Court.

379 Pa.Super. 390, 550 A.2d 213 (1988) (<EM>en
banc</EM>).

<fnt2> Although this <EM>pro se</EM> motion was docketed
on July 27, 2023, we deem it to have been
filed on July 6, 2023, when Appellant handed
it to prison officials. <EMBI>See Commonwealth v.
Jones,</EMBI> 549 Pa. 58, 700 A.2d 423 (1997) (explaining
the "prisoner mailbox rule").

<fnt3> For background purposes, we note that Megan's
Law III, 42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect;&sect; 9795.1-9799.4,
was in effect at the time of Appellant's sentencing.
However, on December 20, 2011, the
Pennsylvania General Assembly enacted the
Sexual Offender Registration and Notification
Act (SORNA), 42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect;&sect; 9791-9799.9. As
a result, SORNA provided for the expiration
of Megan's Law III, as of December 20, 2012,
the effective date of SORNA. Thereafter, in
response to various Pennsylvania Supreme
Court decisions, the Legislature amended
SORNA I and enacted SORNA "Act 10" of
2019, Act of Feb. 21, 2018, P.L. 27, creating a
new statutory scheme referred to as SORNA
II. Through Act 10, the General Assembly
split SORNA I's former Subchapter H into a
Revised Subchapter H and Subchapter I.
Subchapter I addresses sexual offenders who
committed an offense on or after April 22,
1996, but before December 20, 2012. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 42
Pa.C.S.A. &sect;&sect; 9799.51-9799.75. Subchapter I
contains less stringent reporting requirements
than Revised Subchapter H, which applies to
offenders who committed an offense on or
after December 20, 2012. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 42 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect;&sect; 9799.10-9799.42. Since Appellant committed
his offenses on or about August 29, 2009,
Subchapter I applies in this case.

<P20>Under Subchapter I, a person designated to
be an SVP is subject to lifetime registration.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> 42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 9799.55(b)(3)-(4). In <EMBI>Lacombe,</EMBI>
our Supreme Court held that the registration
requirements in Subchapter I are
not punitive and thus retroactive application
of those requirements does not violate our
constitutional <EM>ex post facto</EM> rules. <EMBI>See Lacombe,
supra,</EMBI> 234 A.3d at 626-27. <EMBI>Lacombe</EMBI>
further held that a challenge to a sexual offender
registration statute could be brought
outside the PCRA. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 618.

<fnt4> We note Appellant initially claims that,
since Megan's Law III is void, we should
cease our inquiry and conclude he cannot be
subject to any RNC requirements. He claims:
"Void from the beginning-void for all time."
Appellant's Brief at 26. However, given our
Legislature's passing of SORNA II, and more
specifically Subchapter I to which Appellant
is subject, we disagree that our inquiry ends
with the voiding of Megans' Law III. Apparently
recognizing we might so hold, Appellant
alternatively argues that application of Subchapter
I of SORNA II retroactively is unconstitutional.

<fnt5> <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Butler,</EMBI> 657 Pa. 579, 226
A.3d 972 (2020) (<EMBI>Butler II</EMBI>).

<fnt6> <EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 126(b) (unpublished non-precedential
decisions of the Superior Court filed
after May 1, 2019, may be cited for their
persuasive value).

<fnt7> We note Appellant also claims Subchapter I
violates the separation of powers doctrine by
unconstitutionally usurping judicial sentencing
authority. However, in <EMBI>Lacombe,</EMBI> our Supreme
Court noted that such a claim necessarily
fails since Subchapter I is nonpunitive.
<EMBI>See Lacombe, supra,</EMBI> 234 A.3d at 608 n.5.

<fnt8> The Pennsylvania Constitution recognizes
the right to reputation as a fundamental interest.
<EMBI>See Commonwealth v. Morgan,</EMBI> 258 A.3d
1147 (Pa. Super. 2021).

<fnt9> We note that the defendant in <EMBI>Torsilieri</EMBI> was
not an SVP. Moreover, <EMBI>Torsilieri</EMBI> focused on
Revised Subchapter H and whether the presumption
contained in Section 9799.11(4) of
SORNA &mdash; that individuals convicted of sexual
offenses pose a high risk of committing
additional sexual offenses &mdash; was an unconstitutional
irrebuttable presumption.

<fnt10> As it applies to Subchapter I, the General
Assembly provided: "These sexually violent
predators and offenders pose a high risk of
engaging in further offenses even after being
released from incarceration or commitments,
and protection from this type of offender is a
paramount governmental interest." 42 Pa.
C.S.A. &sect; 9799.51(a)(2).

<fnt11> We note Appellant raised his claims challenging
the legality of his sentence and the
voluntariness of his plea in his <EM>pro se</EM> "Motion
to Vacate Defendant's Illegal SVP Designation
and Lifetime Registration Requirements
Imposed under Megan's Law III." As Appellant
indicates, the trial court determined
these claims should be treated under the auspices
of the PCRA.

<fnt12> Our scope and standard of review when
reviewing the denial of a PCRA petition are
well-settled:

<B22>[O]ur scope of review is limited by the
parameters of the [PCRA]. Our standard of
review permits us to consider only whether
the PCRA court's determination is supported
by the evidence of record and
whether it is free from legal error. Moreover,
in general we may affirm the decision
of the [PCRA court] if there is any basis on
the record to support the [PCRA] court's
action[.]

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Heilman,</EMBI> 867 A.2d 542,
544 (Pa. Super. 2005) (quotations and citations
omitted).

<fnt13> As the Commonwealth notes, Appellant
misreads the record inasmuch as the "Commonwealth
waived the imposition of a mandatory
minimum sentence under [Section]
9718(a)(3) when it entered into the negotiated
plea agreement and [Appellant] entered his
guilty plea." Commonwealth's Brief at 28.

<fnt14> We note Appellant claims that the PCRA
time bar does not apply to his sentencing
claims because the errors in his case are
patent and obvious. He relies on <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. McGee,</EMBI> ___ Pa. ___, 302 A.3d 659
(2023), for the proposition that a court has
the authority to correct patent and obvious
errors "despite the absence of traditional jurisdiction."
<EMBI>McGee, supra,</EMBI> 302 A.3d at 663.
However, our Supreme Court expressly ruled
in <EMBI>McGee</EMBI> that there was no patent error and
it "[did] not reach the question of whether a
trial court's inherent authority to correct patent
and obvious errors in the record is subject
to the time limitations of the PCRA." <EMBI>McGee,
supra,</EMBI> 302 A.3d at 670. Therefore, Appellant's
reliance on <EMBI>McGee</EMBI> is not legally persuasive.

<P20>Furthermore, even if a trial court's authority
to correct patent and obvious errors in the
record were not subject to the PCRA's time
limitations, Appellant's claim of a patent and
obvious error is unavailing. A patent and obvious
error is one that is, as the title implies,
obvious. Here, there is no obvious error.

<fnt15> On or about September 12, 2024, Appellant
filed in this Court an "Application for
Relief" wherein he seeks reimbursement of
$92.40 for the copy and mail fees associated
with the filing of his appellate brief. Appellant
avers the funds were removed from his personal
inmate account, and he wants the funds
reimbursed to him. We deny Appellant's Application
for Relief. Appellant is not proceeding
<EM>in forma pauperis</EM> in this matter. Further,
we note the trial court conducted an inquiry
during the October 25, 2023, hearing as to
Appellant's ability to pay. Appellant admitted
he had over $20,000.00 in his checking account,
and he had no financial impediment.

[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <author>BECK</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Keith Phillips ("Phillips") appeals from
the judgment of sentence entered by the
Philadelphia County Court of Common
Pleas ("trial court") after a jury convicted
him of first-degree murder, attempted
murder, aggravated assault, possessing an
instrument of crime ("PIC"), carrying a
firearm on public streets in Philadelphia,
and carrying a firearm without a license.<fnr1>
Phillips challenges the trial court's denial
of his motion to suppress statements he
made during an interview with police on
the basis that the interviewing detectives
violated the protections of <EMBI>Miranda v. Arizona,</EMBI>
384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16
L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), after he had voluntarily
waived those rights. Because we conclude
that the detectives who conducted
the interrogation violated the protections
of <EMBI>Miranda,</EMBI> invalidating his waiver of
those rights, we vacate Phillips' judgment
of sentence and remand the case to the
trial court for a new trial.

<P20>We summarize the factual history of this
case as follows. I-Dean Fulton ("Fulton")
was the subject of an FBI investigation
involving drug trafficking. Fulton, suspecting
that his cousin, Nasir Sadat ("Sadat"),
was cooperating with the investigation, ordered
"a hit" on Sadat.

<P20>On July 5, 2019, Jewell Williams, Jr.
("Williams") was driving around North
Philadelphia at around 4:00 p.m., waiting
to go to a haircut appointment. While passing
the time, Williams saw his friend, Sadat,
near the intersection of 16th and
Clearfield Streets; he parked his car to
greet Sadat. Sadat was in the process of
rehabilitating a nearby property, and he
asked Williams to look at the progress of
the project. After viewing the property,
Sadat and Williams walked across the
street from the house to one of Sadat's
work trucks where they conversed with
each other and with a passerby. At this
time, surveillance footage showed several
individuals on bicycles circling the area.
Shortly thereafter, one of the bicyclists,
which surveillance footage of the incident
showed to be wearing a shirt with a distinctive
floral pattern, walked up to Sadat
and Williams and opened fire. Sadat sustained
gunshot wounds to his head, neck,
and arm; Williams sustained gunshot
wounds to his chest, buttocks, arm, leg,
and back. The perpetrator immediately
fled the scene.

<P20>Within one to two minutes, Philadelphia
police officers arrived at the scene and
immediately transported both Sadat and
Williams to Temple University Hospital.
Williams survived but had to undergo extensive
surgery and spent two weeks in
the hospital and several weeks at a rehabilitation
facility. Sadat was pronounced
dead at the hospital at 5:47 p.m. Philadelphia
Associate Medical Examiner Dr.
Khalil Wardak determined that Sadat's
cause of death was multiple gunshot
wounds, and the manner of death was
homicide.

<P20>While investigating the shooting, Philadelphia
Police Detective John Verrecchio
received an anonymous tip that the shooter
in this case had an Instagram account
with the handle "@broad_day_kay." When
Detective Verrecchio searched the handle
<Page 1240>
on Instagram, it returned pictures of an
individual he believed to be Phillips wearing
floral shirts similar to the shirt worn
by the assailant in the surveillance footage
of the shooting. Roughly ten minutes after
the shooting, this Instagram account made
posts indicating that the owner of the account
was just involved in a murder for
hire.

<P20>On November 7, 2019, Detective Verrecchio
and Detective Thomas Gaul conducted
an interview of Phillips&mdash;who, at that time,
was incarcerated on other charges&mdash;at the
Philadelphia Police Department's Homicide
Unit. The detectives sought to question
Phillips concerning the shooting of
Sadat and Williams as well as what they
believed to be a retaliatory shooting where
Phillips was the victim. After detectives
read Phillips his <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> rights and he
waived his right to remain silent, Phillips
made several incriminating statements to
the detectives, including admitting that he
was the owner of the "@broad_day_kay"
Instagram account and that he was involved
in the shooting of Sadat and
Williams.

<P20>Prior to trial, Phillips filed a motion to
suppress his interview with Detectives
Verrecchio and Gaul. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Motion to Suppress
Statement, 12/28/2021. Phillips
averred that the Detective Gaul violated
his <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> rights when, shortly after
waiving his right to remain silent, he asked
the detectives: "You all going to use this in
court on me?" and Detective Gaul responded:
"Nobody's using anything in court."
Brief in Support of Motion to Suppress
Statement, 3/22/2022, at 1-13. Phillips
averred that Detective Gaul's statement
violated <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> because the statement
was factually incorrect and directly contradicted
<EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> because anything Phillips
told police could, in fact, be used against
him in court. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> On April 25, 2022, the
trial court held a hearing on the suppression
motion, at the conclusion of which the
court denied this aspect of the motion.<fnr2>

<P20>On May 12, 2023, following trial,<fnr3> a jury
found Phillips guilty of the aforementioned
crimes. The same day, the trial court sentenced
Phillips to the mandatory term of
life in prison without the possibility of
parole on the first-degree murder conviction,
and consecutive sentences of ten to
twenty years in prison for attempted murder,
two-and-a-half to five years each for
PIC and carrying a firearm on the public
streets of Philadelphia, respectively, and
three-and-a-half to seven years for carrying
a firearm without a license, for an
aggregate sentence of life plus eighteen-and-a-half
to thirty-seven years of incarceration.
Additionally, the trial court found
Phillips in contempt of court twice during
the sentencing hearing because of disrespectful
comments he made to the court
and sentenced him to an additional three
to six months in prison on each contempt
conviction, to run consecutively to each
other and to the other sentences. N.T.,
5/12/2023, at 42-46. On May 19, 2023, Phillips
filed a post-sentence motion, which the
trial court denied on August 17, 2023.

<P20>Phillips timely appealed to this Court.
Both the trial court and Phillips have complied
with Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate
<Page 1241>
Procedure 1925. Phillips presents the following
issues for review:

<B24>A. Whether the [trial court] erred as a
matter of law and abused [its] discretion
in admitting as evidence the
testimony of interrogating officers
and video of the interrogation where
the interrogating officers made a
promise of confidentiality to the
[Phillips], violated the protections of
<EMBI>Miranda v. Arizona,</EMBI> and induced
[Phillips] to make an involuntary
statement when at the 38:44 mark
into the video interrogation [Phillips]
asked the officers "You all going
to use this in court on me?" that
was answered by the officer "Nobody's
using anything in court[]"?

<B24>B. Whether after sentencing [Phillips]
to a life sentence without parole, the
[trial court] erred in imposing a consecutive
sentence of [eighteen-and-a-half
to thirty-seven] years by declining
a [presentence] investigation
report requested by [Phillips], resulting
in a record without any
background, evidence of psychological
impairments, history of trauma
and/or character of [Phillips]?

<P00>Phillips' Brief at 12.

<P20>Phillips' first issue challenges the
trial court's denial of his motion to suppress
the statements he made during his
interview with Detectives Verrecchio and
Gaul. The standard of review for the denial
of a suppression motion is well settled:

<B42>Our standard of review in addressing
a challenge to the denial of a suppression
motion is limited to determining
whether the suppression court's factual
findings are supported by the record
and whether the legal conclusions drawn
from those facts are correct. Because
the Commonwealth prevailed before the
suppression court, we may consider only
the evidence of the Commonwealth and
so much of the evidence for the defense
as remains uncontradicted when read in
the context of the record as a whole.
Where the suppression court's factual
findings are supported by the record, we
are bound by these findings and may
reverse only if the court's legal conclusions
are erroneous. The suppression
court's legal conclusions are not binding
on an appellate court, whose duty it is to
determine if the suppression court properly
applied the law to the facts. Thus,
the conclusions of law of the courts below
are subject to our plenary review.

<B42>Moreover, appellate courts are limited
to reviewing only the evidence presented
at the suppression hearing when examining
a ruling on a [pretrial] motion to
suppress.

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Carey,</EMBI> 249 A.3d 1217,
1223 (Pa. Super. 2021).

<P20>Phillips argues that the trial court erred
in denying his suppression motion because
Detective Gaul made statements to him
that directly contradicted the <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI>
warnings. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Phillips' Brief at 31-62. Specifically,
Phillips takes issue with the following
portion of his interrogation, which
occurred after the detectives had informed
him of his rights pursuant to <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> and
Phillips had signed a card waiving those
rights:

<B22>[Detective Gaul]: ... Now, do you remember
the day that you were shot? As
far as [the] date?

<B22>[Phillips]: Yeah, um. It was um, I went
to Dorney Park that day, it was July,
July 15th.

<B22>[Detective Gaul]: [O]kay. And, like I said
we're not asking you to sign a photograph
or circle somebody's photograph
or sign a statement, but who shot you?

<B22>[Phillips]: (points to the camera). You all
gonna use this in court on me?
<Page 1242>

<B22>[Detective Gaul]: Nobody's using anything
in court. Like I said, we're not
here to try to railroad you or anything
like that. What we're trying to do is like
we talked about in the beginning. And
even though it's kinda like an age old
saying, as you go through life you can
keep on making the same decisions and
the same thing's going to keep on happening.
All right. So at some point, at
different times, you gotta be old enough
to realize that you know what, maybe
the same mistakes I'm making are the
reason why I'm in the situation that I'm
in....

<B22>[Phillips]: Yeah.

<P00>N.T., 4/25/2022, Exhibit C-2 (hereinafter
"Interrogation Transcript") at 14-15.

<P20>Phillips argues that Detective Gaul's
statement "Nobody's using anything in
court" was in direct contravention to the
<EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> warning that "anything you say
can and will be used against you in a court
of law." Phillips' Brief at 31. Phillips further
asserts that this statement undermined
his voluntary waiver of his <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI>
rights, as it was an improper promise of
confidentiality and that consequently, his
statements, including his admission to participating
in the shooting of Sadat and
Williams, was inadmissible and subject to
suppression. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>The law is clear that when an
individual is in custody and subject to interrogation,
that individual is entitled to
<EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> warnings. <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Yandamuri,</EMBI> 639 Pa. 100, 159 A.3d 503, 520
(2017) (citing <EMBI>Miranda,</EMBI> 384 U.S. at 478-79,
86 S.Ct. 1602). Our Supreme Court has
explained that under such circumstances,
"before law enforcement officers question
an individual" the officers "must first warn
the individual that he has the right to
remain silent, that anything he says can be
used against him in a court of law, that he
has the right to the presence of an attorney,
and that if he cannot afford an attorney
one will be appointed." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 520-21
(citing <EMBI>Miranda,</EMBI> 384 U.S. at 478-79, 86
S.Ct. 1602). The <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> rights are rooted
in the portion of the Fifth Amendment
to the United States Constitution that protects
individuals from self-incrimination.<fnr4>
<EMBI>See Miranda,</EMBI> 384 U.S. at 469, 86 S.Ct.
1602. Importantly, the rights set forth in
the <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> warnings persist throughout
the entirety of an interrogation. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 473-74,
86 S.Ct. 1602 ("If the individual indicates
in any manner, at any time prior to
or during questioning, that he wishes to
remain silent, the interrogation must
cease.").

<P20>With respect to the warning regarding
the use of an individual's statements in
court, the <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> Court explained that
the warning is necessary to explicitly inform
the individual "not only of the privilege
[against compelled self-incrimination],
but also of the consequences of foregoing
it." <EMBI>Miranda,</EMBI> 384 U.S. at 469, 86 S.Ct.
1602. The Court reasoned that "[i]t is only
through an awareness of these consequences
that there can be any assurance of
real understanding and intelligent exercise
of the privilege" and that "this warning
may serve to make the individual more
acutely aware that he is faced with a phase
of the adversary system&mdash;that is he is not
in the presence of persons acting solely in
his interest." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Additionally, the United States Supreme
Court has stated that review into the adequacy
of the waiver of <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> rights is a
two-part inquiry:
<Page 1243>

<B22>First, the relinquishment of the right
must have been voluntary in the sense
that it was the product of a free and
deliberate choice rather than intimidation,
coercion, or deception. Second,
the waiver must have been made with a
full awareness of both the nature of the
right being abandoned and the consequences
of the decision to abandon it.
Only if the totality of the circumstances
surrounding the interrogation reveals
both an uncoerced choice and the requisite
level of comprehension may a court
properly conclude that the <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI>
rights have been waived.

<P00><EMBI>Moran v. Burbine,</EMBI> 475 U.S. 412, 421, 106
S.Ct. 1135, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986) (citation
omitted); <EMBI>see also Commonwealth v.
Smith,</EMBI> 210 A.3d 1050, 1058 (Pa. Super.
2019) (same).

<P20>Critically, the United States
Supreme Court has recognized that statements
or actions by police officers can
undermine protections afforded by the <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI>
warnings. <EMBI>Miranda,</EMBI> 384 U.S. at
476, 86 S.Ct. 1602. Where there is evidence
that demonstrates "that the accused was
threatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver,"
then that "will, of course, show that
the defendant did not voluntarily waive his
privilege." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>; <EMBI>see also Colorado v.
Spring,</EMBI> 479 U.S. 564, 576 n.8, 107 S.Ct.
851, 93 L.Ed.2d 954 (1987) (observing that
the Court had previously "found affirmative
misrepresentations by the police sufficient
to invalidate a suspect's waiver of the
Fifth Amendment privilege") (citing <EMBI>Lynumn
v. Illinois,</EMBI> 372 U.S. 528, 83 S.Ct. 917,
9 L.Ed.2d 922 (1963); <EMBI>Spano v. New York,</EMBI>
360 U.S. 315, 79 S.Ct. 1202, 3 L.Ed.2d 1265
(1959)). As stated by our Supreme Court:

<B22>Promises of benefits or special considerations,
however benign in intent, comprise
the sort of persuasion and trickery
which easily can mislead suspects
into giving confessions. The process of
rendering <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> warnings should
proceed freely without any intruding
frustration by the police. Only in that
fashion can we trust the validity of subsequent
admissions, for if the initial
employment of <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> is exploited illegally,
succeeding inculpatory declarations
are compromised. Misleading
statements and promises by the police
choke off the legal process at the very
moment which <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> was designed
to protect.

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Gibbs,</EMBI> 520 Pa. 151, 553
A.2d 409, 411 (1989).<fnr5>

<P20>Additionally, when evaluating
"the comprehensibility and efficacy of the
<EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> warnings" we must do from the
perspective of "a reasonable person in the
suspect's shoes." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Charleston,</EMBI> 16 A.3d 505, 523 (Pa. Super.
2011) (quoting <EMBI>Missouri v. Seibert,</EMBI> 542
U.S. 600, 602, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d
643 (2004) (Souter, J., Opinion Announcing
the Judgment of the Court)), <EMBI>abrogated on
other grounds by In re L.J.,</EMBI> 622 Pa. 126,
79 A.3d 1073 (2013). Regardless of whether
the police officer's conduct was intentional
or inadvertent, the motive underlying the
officer's conduct "is irrelevant to the question
of the intelligence and voluntariness of
[the accused]'s election to abandon his
rights." <EMBI>Burbine,</EMBI> 475 U.S. at 423, 106
S.Ct. 1135. "Such conduct" by the interrogating
officer "is only relevant to the constitutional
validity of a waiver if it deprives
a defendant of knowledge essential to his
<Page 1244>
ability to understand the nature of his
rights and the consequences of abandoning
them." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 424, 106 S.Ct. 1135.

<P20>Moreover, courts "will not
pause to inquire in individual cases whether
the defendant was aware of his rights"
despite noncompliance with <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> because
"[a]ssessments of the knowledge the
defendant possessed, based on information
as to his age, education, intelligence, or
prior contact with authorities, can never be
more than speculation; a warning is a
clearcut fact." <EMBI>Miranda,</EMBI> 384 U.S. at 468-69,
86 S.Ct. 1602 (footnote omitted). Thus,
when analyzing the voluntariness of the
waiver of <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> rights or a confession,
we must look only to the actual words of
the interrogating officer and the understanding
of a reasonable person standing
in the accused's shoes, not to the motives
or beliefs underlying the officer's conduct,
nor can we speculate regarding the knowledge
a suspect possessed about their
rights. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI>; <EMBI>see also Burbine,</EMBI> 475 U.S.
at 423, 106 S.Ct. 1135.

<P20>The record in this case reflects that
during their interrogation of Phillips, Detectives
Verrecchio and Gaul initially discussed
biographical information with him,
asked him questions about his family, and
then posed a few questions about the injuries
Phillips sustained during the recent
shooting. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Interrogation Transcript at
1-9. Detective Gaul then informed Phillips
that they were going to be questioning him
about the "various shootings that have
been taking place all throughout the area
where you were shot and we're not sure
why you were shot as far as motive, you
might have done something, you might not
have done something," thus making Phillips
aware they would be discussing more
than just the incident during which he was
shot and that the detectives believed he
may have played a role in one or more of
the other shootings. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 10.

<P20>Immediately thereafter, Detective Gaul
read Phillips his <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> rights and Phillips
signed a form waiving those rights. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
After the detectives asked Phillips more
questions about his family, Detective Gaul
asked Phillips who shot him. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 10-14.
It was at this point that Phillips pointed to
the camera in the room and asked, "You
all gonna use this in court on me?" to
which Detective Gaul responded, "Nobody's
using anything in court." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> and 14.
With that assurance, Phillips continued to
speak with the detectives, and during the
conversation that followed, he expressed
his fear of retribution if he told the detectives
who had shot him and ultimately
provided critical information related to his
involvement in the shooting of Sadat and
Williams. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 14-16, 92-100.

<P20>At the hearing on Phillips' suppression
motion, Detective Gaul testified regarding
Phillips' response to the question of who
shot him:

<B22>Q. [Phillips] pointed to the camera and
said: "You all gonna use this in court on
me?" When he said "this," what did you
take him to mean? What did you take
that question to mean when he was asking
that?

<C5>* * *

<B22>A. Based on my experience with shootings,
you know, both nonfatal and fatal
shootings and dealing with witnesses,
my understanding from [Phillips'] response
was the way he pointed to the
camera and said "you all gonna use this
in court," was that he was afraid that it
would be &mdash; this video would be getting
out if he did identify who shot him. You
know, that was how I took that, that he
was concerned about his information
getting out in court, that we &mdash; everybody
in this room, you know, I'm sure
has seen that one of the biggest hurdles
to get over is witness &mdash; or actually
<Page 1245>
victim intimidation. So that's what I took
that as.

<B22>Q. And when you said, "Nobody's using
anything in court, bud, like I said, we're
not here to try to railroad you or anything
like that," what were you telling
[Phillips] was not going to be used in
court at that specific moment?

<B22>A. His identification. Like if he did come
out and then say, you know, look, it was
Kevin or whoever that shot him, you
know what I mean, we weren't going to
&mdash; you know, at this point in the investigation,
there was going to be other
means that we could use to further the
investigation, either through grand jury,
indicting grand jury. We were trying to
&mdash; I was trying to actually put him at
ease so he would keep talking at this
point and tell us who shot him.

<P00>N.T., 4/25/2022, at 29-31.

<P20>In denying Phillips' motion to suppress
the statements he made during his interrogation
after Detective Gaul assured him
his statement would not be used in court,
the trial court explained:

<B22>The [c]ourt found the testimony of Detective
Gaul to be credible. [N.T.,
4/25/2022,] at 48. The [c]ourt found that
[Phillips] was given <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> warnings,
which he unequivocally waived. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> The
[c]ourt found that [Phillips] was treated
well throughout the interview, and that
no coercion took place. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> With respect
to Detective Gaul's statement that "[n]obody's
using anything in court," the
[c]ourt stated as follows:

<B44>I think it's very clear from the video
that when Detective Gaul said nobody
is using anything in court, he was
clearly, unquestionably referring to
[Phillips'] understandable concern
about identifying somebody who shot
him in the environment here in Philadelphia,
where, as he eloquently described
during the statement, often
involves, including many people he
personally knew, getting shot and
killed. And that to me would not in
any way violate the principles of <EMBI>Miranda.</EMBI>
It did not imply that the statement
would not be used against him.
It implied that the statement would
not be used against ... whomever it
was who shot him. And that's an altogether
different matter.

<B22><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 47. The [c]ourt found that no
violation of <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> occurred prior to
[Phillips'] request for an attorney, and
that [Phillips'] statement was voluntary.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P00>Trial Court Opinion, 12/12/2023, at 9.

<P20>We conclude that the trial court's
decision is not supported by the record or
the relevant law. The trial court's reasoning
overlooks a significant aspect of Detective
Gaul's answer to Phillips' direct question
"You all going to use this in court on
me?" <EMBI>See</EMBI> Interrogation Transcript at 14
(emphasis added). Phillips did not ask if
the detectives were going to use any portion
of his statement in court in general, he
asked if they were going to use his statements
in court against him. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> Detective
Gaul made no attempt to clarify the
question, and instead he explicitly told
Phillips that "Nobody's using anything in
court" without any equivocation or qualification.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (emphasis added). To the contrary,
Detective Gaul explained this assurance
by telling Phillips that police were not
there "to railroad" him but were exploring
Phillips' actions that may have led to his
own shooting. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> In other words, the detectives
were not out to get Phillips, they
just wanted to know who shot him and
what he did to cause someone to shoot
him.

<P20>The plain meaning of Detective Gaul's
actual words was that the detectives would
not use anything that Phillips said in court
<Page 1246>
against him. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> This was a false,
misleading, and empty promise of confidentiality.
<EMBI>See Gibbs,</EMBI> 553 A.2d at 411. This
is particularly true considering the detectives'
frequent attempts to convince Phillips
that they had his best interests in
mind, referring to him as "bud" throughout
the interview, telling him that they
were trying to help him, and repeatedly
telling him that they were not trying to
"railroad" him, including in the context of
Detective Gaul's promise that nothing Phillips
said was going to be used against him
in court. <EMBI>See, e.g.,</EMBI> Interrogation Transcript
at 10, 14, 16, 34, 79, 82, 84.

<P20>Phillips also did not express any concern
about retribution prior to Detective Gaul
assuring him "Nobody's using anything in
court." <EMBI>See</EMBI> Interrogation Transcript at 14.
Until that point, Phillips had only provided
the detectives with biographical information
and details about the injuries he had
sustained when he was shot. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at 1-14.
Phillips only expressed a fear of retribution
and talked about people he knew
getting shot in retaliation for talking to
police after Detective Gaul stated, "Nobody's
using anything in court." <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at
14-16. Although Detective Gaul may have
subjectively believed, based on his training
and experience, that Phillips asked the
question based upon his concern about retaliation
for telling police who shot him,
there is no support in the record for a
finding that Phillips understood the assurance
that nothing would be used against
him in court to be limited to his identification
of his assailant, especially in light of
the clear and unambiguous language of
both Phillips' question and Detective
Gaul's response.

<P20>As the authority set forth above makes
clear, the motives and beliefs underlying
Detective Gaul's conduct is irrelevant
when determining whether Phillips had
voluntarily waived his rights pursuant to
<EMBI>Miranda. See Miranda,</EMBI> 384 U.S. at 469-70,
86 S.Ct. 1602; <EMBI>Burbine,</EMBI> 475 U.S. at
423, 106 S.Ct. 1135. Rather, the relevant
considerations are the actual words that
Detective Gaul uttered and what a reasonable
person in Phillips' position would have
understood regarding his rights under the
totality of the circumstances. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> In
this case, the record reflects that almost
immediately after the detectives read Phillips
the <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> warnings, including the
warning that anything he said could be
used against him in a court of law, Detective
Gaul told Phillips, without qualification
and in direct contravention to <EMBI>Miranda,</EMBI>
"Nobody's using anything in court," detectives
were not going to "railroad" him, and
that they wanted to know about Phillips'
actions that may have led to his own shooting.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Interrogation Transcript at 14.
Indeed, it was not until after this assurance
was made that Phillips made any
inculpatory statements.

<P20>Based on the foregoing, we conclude
that when Detective Gaul told Phillips
"Nobody's using anything in court," he
violated Phillips' rights under <EMBI>Miranda,</EMBI>
invalidating his voluntary waiver of those
rights, and that such violation required
suppression of any statements Phillips
made during the remainder of his interrogation.
<EMBI>See Spring,</EMBI> 479 U.S. at 576 n.8, 107
S.Ct. 851 (recognizing that cases exist
wherein the Court has found, even after
proper <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> warnings and a knowing,
intelligent, and voluntary waiver, an interrogator
may, through subsequent statements
during the ensuing interrogation,
subvert those warnings and thus invalidate
the suspect's earlier waiver, requiring suppression
of statements the suspect made
thereafter during the interrogation); <EMBI>Moran,</EMBI>
475 U.S. at 426, 106 S.Ct. 1135 (observing
"the interrogation process is `inherently
coercive' and that, as a consequence,
there exists a substantial risk that the
police will inadvertently traverse the fine
<Page 1247>
line between legitimate efforts to elicit admissions
and constitutionally impermissible
compulsion") (citation omitted); <EMBI>see
also Hopkins v. Cockrell,</EMBI> 325 F.3d 579,
585 (5th Cir. 2003) ("An officer cannot read
the defendant his <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> warnings and
then turn around and tell him that despite
those warnings, what the defendant tells
the officer will be confidential and still use
the resultant confession against the defendant.").
The trial court therefore erred in
denying Phillips' motion to suppress those
statements.

<P20>We further conclude that such
error was not harmless. "An error is harmless
if it could not have contributed to the
verdict, or stated conversely, an error cannot
be harmless if there is a reasonable
possibility the error might have contributed
to the conviction." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Poplawski,</EMBI> 634 Pa. 517, 130 A.3d 697, 716
(2015). Harmless error occurs where:

<B22>(1) the error did not prejudice the defendant
or the prejudice was de minimis;

<B22>(2) the erroneously admitted evidence
was merely cumulative of other untainted
evidence which was substantially similar
to the erroneously admitted evidence;
or

<B22>(3) the properly admitted and uncontradicted
evidence of guilt was so overwhelming
and the prejudicial effect of
the error was so insignificant by comparison
that the error could not have
contributed to the verdict.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (citation omitted). "The Commonwealth
has the burden of proving harmless error
beyond a reasonable doubt." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>At the outset, we note that the
Commonwealth did not argue harmless error
in its brief before this Court. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
Commonwealth's Brief at 9-18. Although
we may raise the question of harmlessness
sua sponte, <EMBI>see Commonwealth v. Hamlett,</EMBI>
660 Pa. 379, 234 A.3d 486, 492 (2020),
we cannot conclude that Phillips' confession
could not have contributed to the verdict.
During the interrogation, Phillips
made numerous incriminating statements.
Phillips told the detectives that he owned
the Instagram account "@broad_day_kay,"
that he was at the scene at the time
Sadat and Williams were shot, that he was
paid $4,500 to serve as a lookout for his co-conspirators
who he thought were going to
commit a robbery during a drug transaction,
and that his co-conspirators were getting
paid $50,000. Interrogation Transcript
at 92-100. Phillips' confession during the
interrogation to playing an integral role in
the criminal activity that resulted in Sadat's
death resulted in his admission to the
detectives that he participated in a conspiracy
to commit murder. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> As the
United States Supreme Court has recognized:

<B22>A confession is like no other evidence.
Indeed, the defendant's own confession
is probably the most probative and damaging
evidence that can be admitted
against him.... The admissions of a
defendant come from the actor himself,
the most knowledgeable and unimpeachable
source of information about his past
conduct. Certainly, confessions have profound
impact on the jury, so much so
that we may justifiably doubt its ability
to put them out of mind even if told to
do so.

<P00><EMBI>Arizona v. Fulminante,</EMBI> 499 U.S. 279, 296,
111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991); <EMBI>see
also Commonwealth v. Ardestani,</EMBI> 558 Pa.
191, 736 A.2d 552, 557 (1999) (Zappala, J.,
Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the
Court) (same). The evidence the Commonwealth
submitted to the jury of Phillips'
interrogation was, standing alone, sufficient
to elicit a conviction of first-degree
murder from the jury.

<P20>Prior to speaking with Phillips, the detectives
believed Phillips was the owner of
<Page 1248>
the "@broad_day_kay" Instagram handle,
<EMBI>see</EMBI> N.T., 5/10/2023, at 103-04, but had no
affirmative evidence that the account was
his until he confirmed ownership during
the interrogation. Additionally, there was
no eyewitness testimony at trial identifying
Phillips as the shooter and the surveillance
footage of the shooting was not of
high enough quality for police to utilize
facial recognition software to identify the
shooter. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 102-03. Without the evidence
the detectives obtained from the
interrogation, the most incriminating evidence
the Commonwealth had against
Phillips was that he conducted internet
searches on the day of the shooting for
extended clips for 9mm handguns, and police
recovered 9mm shell casings from the
crime scene, N.T. 5/10/2023, at 164-66, and
his cell phone pinged the cell tower in the
vicinity of the crime scene around the time
of the shooting. N.T., 5/11/2023, at 40.

<P20>While this circumstantial evidence could
support a finding of Phillips' guilt, it pales
in comparison to the unequivocal evidence
the detectives obtained during the interrogation.
Thus, we cannot say the erroneously
admitted evidence was merely cumulative
of other untainted evidence, nor can
we say that the properly admitted evidence
of guilt was so overwhelming that
the prejudicial effect of the error was so
insignificant by comparison that the error
could not have contributed to the verdict.
<EMBI>See Poplawski,</EMBI> 130 A.3d at 716. Rather,
the record reflects that there was, at the
very least, a reasonable probability that
the erroneously admitted evidence contributed
to the verdict and Phillips was prejudiced
by its admission. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> We therefore
cannot find that the admission of
Phillips' confession was harmless error.

<P20>Accordingly, we must vacate Phillips'
judgment of sentence and remand this
matter to the trial court for a new trial.<fnr6>

<P20>Judgment of sentence vacated. Case remanded.
Jurisdiction relinquished.

6108, 6106(a)(1).

<fnt2> We note that the trial court did suppress a
portion of Phillips' statement to police. Later
in the interrogation, Phillips eventually requested
a lawyer. N.T., 4/25/2022, Exhibit C-2
at 109. Although the detectives purported to
stop their interrogation, they engaged in what
they referred to as a "recap" of the interview
with Phillips after he requested counsel. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
The trial court determined that the "recap"
after Phillips requested an attorney violated
<EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> and must be suppressed. N.T.,
4/25/2022, at 49-50.

<fnt3> This was Phillips' second trial. His first trial
ended in a mistrial because of an outbreak
Covid-19 among the jurors. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T.,
5/4/2022, at 4-8.

<fnt4> We note that Phillps does not raise a separate
claim under Article I, &sect; 9 of the Pennsylvania
Constitution, and we therefore limit our
discussion to the suppression decision under
the Fifth Amendment.

<fnt5> "This pronouncement, applied in <EMBI>Gibbs</EMBI> to
the right to counsel, was also intended by the
<EMBI>Gibbs</EMBI> Court to extend to all of the rights
elucidated in <EMBI>Miranda</EMBI> and subsequent derivative
case law, including the right to remain
silent." <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Morgan,</EMBI> 414

539 Pa. 274, 652 A.2d 295 (1994) (per curiam).

<fnt6> Based on our disposition of Phillips' first
issue, we need not address his remaining issue
challenging the discretionary aspects of
his sentence.

<P20>OPINION BY <author>KUNSELMAN</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>Eric Raymond George appeals from the
judgment of sentence imposed for his convictions
of murder of the third degree,
aggravated assault, and strangulation. 18
Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2502(c), 2702(a)(1), 2718(a)(1).
He argues that murder of the third degree
and strangulation should have merged for
sentencing purposes. We affirm.

<P20>A jury found George guilty of the above
crimes based on evidence that he strangled
his wife to death. The trial court initially
imposed a mandatory-minimum sentence
of 25 to 50 years of incarceration for murder
and a concurrent 5-to-10-year sentence
for strangulation. This Court vacated and
remanded for resentencing, ruling that
George's prior conviction for robbery in
Wisconsin did not qualify as a predicate
offense for purposes of Pennsylvania's
mandatory sentencing law. <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. George,</EMBI> 311 A.3d 621 (Pa. Super.
2023) (non-precedential decision).

<P20>On March 18, 2024, the trial court
resentenced George to 17 to 34 years for
murder and a consecutive term of 5 to 10
years for strangulation. (For sentencing
purposes, aggravated assault merged with
<Page 1250>
murder of the third degree.) George
moved for reconsideration <EM>nunc pro tunc,</EM>
which the trial court denied. George timely
appealed.<fnr1> George and the trial court complied
with Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate
Procedure 1925.

<P20>George argues on appeal that the
trial court erred by failing to merge, for
sentencing purposes, his convictions for
murder of the third degree and strangulation.
This claim implicates the legality of
George's sentence, over which we exercise
a <EM>de novo</EM> standard of review and a plenary
scope of review. <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Lynch,</EMBI>
242 A.3d 339, 348 (Pa. Super. 2020).

<P20>By statute, crimes merge for sentencing
purposes only if "the crimes arise
from a single criminal act and all of the
statutory elements of one offense are included
in the statutory elements of the
other offense." 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9765. As it is
undisputed that George's crimes arose
from a single act, our analysis of merger
"begins and ends with the statutory elements
of each offense." <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Edwards,</EMBI> 667 Pa. 647, 256 A.3d 1130, 1137
(2021).

<P20>The statutory elements of strangulation
are not included in the statutory
elements of murder of the third degree.
Strangulation, as charged here, is committed
when a "person knowingly or intentionally
impedes the breathing or circulation
of the blood of another person by ...
applying pressure to the throat or neck."
18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2718(a)(1). Murder, by contrast,
is defined in the statute by degrees:
murder of the first degree (committed by
an intentional killing), murder of the second
degree (committed in the perpetration
of a felony), and murder of the third degree
("All other kinds of murder"). 18 Pa.
C.S. &sect; 2502. As interpreted by case law,
the elements of murder of the third degree
are that "the accused killed another person
with malice." <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Geiger,</EMBI>
944 A.2d 85, 90 (Pa. Super. 2008).

<P20>A conviction for murder (including
murder of the third degree) requires
proof that the defendant caused the victim's
death. <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Rementer,</EMBI>
410 Pa.Super. 9, 598 A.2d 1300, 1304
(1991), <EMBI>see also</EMBI> 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 303 (titled,
"Causal relationship between conduct and
result"). However, it does not require
proof that the defendant impeded the victim's
breathing or circulation, applied
pressure to the victim's throat or neck, or
employed any specific means to bring
about the death of the victim. Simply put,
a defendant can commit murder without
touching the victim's neck. Because we do
not look beyond the statutory elements of
each offense, <EMBI>Edwards, supra,</EMBI> it does not
matter for the merger analysis that this
was the method by which George killed his
wife. Strangulation does not merge with
murder of the third degree for sentencing
purposes.<fnr2> <EMBI>See Commonwealth v. Leonard,</EMBI>
276 A.3d 251 (Table), 2022 WL
841245, at *6 (Pa. Super. Mar. 22, 2022)
(non-precedential decision) (reaching the
same conclusion).

<P20>George's reliance on <EMBI>Commonwealth v.
Watson,</EMBI> 228 A.3d 928, 941-942 (Pa. Super.
2020), does not change our analysis. In
that pre-<EMBI>Edwards</EMBI> case, we held that simple
assault (attempting to cause or causing
bodily injury or attempting by physical
menace to put another in fear of imminent
<Page 1251>
serious bodily injury) should have merged
for sentencing purposes with robbery
(causing, threatening with, or intentionally
putting another in fear of bodily injury in
the course of committing a theft). <EMBI>See</EMBI> 18
Pa.C.S. &sect; 2701(a)(1) & (3), 3710(a)(1)(iv).
As charged in <EMBI>Watson,</EMBI> simple assault was
a lesser-included offense of robbery.

<P20>Here, however, based on the elements of
the offenses as charged, strangulation is
not a lesser-included offense of murder of
the third degree. Because strangulation
requires proof of an element that murder
does not&mdash;impeding the breathing or circulation
of the blood of another person by
applying pressure to the throat or neck&mdash;
the two crimes do not merge for sentencing
purposes, and the trial court did not
err in this regard.

<P20>Judgment of sentence affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt1> George claimed he was appealing from the
order denying his post-sentence motion. In a
criminal case, however, appeal lies only from
the judgment of sentence; we have amended
the caption accordingly. <EMBI>See Commonwealth
v. Knupp,</EMBI> 290 A.3d 759, 766 n.4 (Pa. Super.
2023) (citation omitted).

<fnt2> Similarly, murder of the third degree requires
proof of an element that strangulation
does not: causing the death of the victim.

<P20>OPINION BY <author>BENDER</author>, <dgn>P.J.E.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>E.B. (Father) appeals from the decrees
terminating his parental rights to R.H.B.
and J.K.B. (Children), and the orders
changing Children's permanency goals
from concurrent return to parent and
adoption, to adoption and permanent legal
custodian.<fnr1> After careful consideration, we
vacate the decrees and orders, and remand
for further proceedings.

<CN><EM>CASE HISTORY</EM>

<P20>R.H.B. was born in December 2019, and
J.K.B. was born in October 2021. This case
began in February 2023, when the York
County Office of Children, Youth and
Families (CYF) filed for emergency protective
custody of Children. Children were
3 and 1&frac12; years old at the time, and Father
was incarcerated in a neighboring county.<fnr2>
CYF sought protective custody based on
Mother abusing drugs and leaving Children
in the care of others for "long lengths
of time." Shelter Care Application, 2/9/23,
at 3-4.

<P20>The trial court explained:

<B22>At the Shelter Care Hearing held on
February 10, 2023, Mother admitted to
using heroin and methadone but said
that she did not leave Children with a
babysitter without providing food and
clothing for Children. Father was unable
to be at the hearing as he was in[carcerated,]
and arrangements for a Zoom appearance
could not be made. It is self-evident
that Dauphin County Prison is
not located within York County, so at
this point, and at all future points in the
case, Father did not reside within York
County. Legal and physical custody
were given to CYF by order [entered
on] February 13, 2023.
<Page 1255>

<B22>An adjudicatory hearing was held [on]
February 17, 2023. Children were removed
from paternal grandmother's
care and placed into a foster home together
at her request on February 13,
2023.... Father could not be contacted
at Dauphin County Prison.

<B22>On April 6, 2023, CYF made a motion to
modify the placement of Children and
the motion was granted. Children were
placed in the home of [their current
foster parents]on April 10, 2023.

<B22>A Status Review Hearing was held on
May 23, 2024.... Father continued to
be incarcerated. Children continued in
their placement.

<B22>On July 11, 2023, [a permanency review
hearing was held and] the court issued a
Permanency Review Order finding ...
Father had no compliance with the permanency
plan.... Father continued to
be incarcerated at Dauphin County Prison.
Children continued to be in the care
of the [] foster family.

<B22>A Status Review Hearing was held [on]
August 21, 2023.... Father continued
to be incarcerated. At this hearing[,] the
court took note that Father had been
found guilty following a trial in the case
docketed at CP-22-CR-0000356-2022 for
two counts of [EWOC], DUI &mdash; 2nd
Offense, and [REAP] on March 14, 2023.
Father was sentenced to 1.5-3 years in
prison[, with 1 year and 10 months of
credit for time served]. It was also determined
that Father had been moved to
SCI Smithfield.

<B22>The children endangered in [Father's]
trial were [C]hildren in this matter, as
[Father] was operating a motor vehicle
... while he was under the influence....
CYF caseworker Isabella Grab
testified that Father, while in Dauphin
County Prison, had not requested any
services and he remained incarcerated.
She did describe practical difficulties in
making Father available for court proceedings
in person or virtually from
Dauphin County Prison, including limitations
on communications imposed by
Dauphin County Prison. Father reported
to Ms. Grab that he was not doing
any services within the prison. The court
noted that at least as of August 21, 2023,
Father's communication problems as
they may have related to Dauphin County
Prison would be resolved by his move
to the SCI system. Children continued
to be in their foster home placement.

<B22>At the Status Review Hearing held [on]
October 16, 2023, ... Father continued
to be incarcerated and requested court
appointed counsel. CYF responded to
the request by mailing Father the application
for court appointed counsel. Children
continued in their foster care placement.

<B22>[On] December 11, 2023, a combined
Permanency and Dispositional Hearing
was held.... Father continued to be
incarcerated and had no visits with Children
as the prison staff could not be
contacted. Father was evidently moved
to SCI Rockview on or about October
19, 2023[,] according to his publicly
available criminal court docket sheet. It
is believed ... Father remains at SCI
Rockview pursuant to the SCI Inmate
Locator. SCI Rockview is not located
within York County. Children continued
to remain in their foster home placement.

<B22>A Status Review Hearing was held [on]
March 12, 2024.... There had been no
changes to Father's status at this time.
Children had begun to interview with
pre-adoptive foster homes.

<P00>Trial Court Opinion (TCO), 7/24/24, at 2-6
(citations and footnotes omitted).

<P20>On April 19, 2024, CYF filed a petition
to terminate Father's parental rights. CYF
alleged grounds for termination pursuant
to 23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2511(a)(1),(2),(5), and (8),
and averred that termination served Children's
<Page 1256>
needs and welfare pursuant to 23
Pa.C.S. &sect; 2511(b). Along with the termination
petition, CYF filed a motion for
judicial notice of the dependency proceedings,
and a motion to change Children's
permanency goals.

<P20>The trial court held a hearing on June 4,
2024. CYF presented testimony from the
"contracted caseworker" for CYF, Michelle
Royer; R.H.B.'s therapist, Ellie
Williams; and Children's foster parent,
[L.W.]. N.T., 6/4/24, at 13, 48, 57. Mother
and Father also testified. At the conclusion
of the hearing, the court entered decrees
terminating Father's parental rights, and
orders taking judicial notice of the dependency
proceedings and changing Children's
permanency goals.

<P20>The trial court entered separate termination
decrees and goal change orders for
each child. The decrees do not mention
statutory grounds for termination. The decrees
state:

<B22>AND NOW, this 4th day of June, 2024,
upon consideration of the within Petition
and after hearing had thereon:

<B22>The [c]ourt, being satisfied as to the
truth of the facts set forth in the Petition,
finds that [Father] has forfeited his
parental rights with respect to [R.H.B./J.K.B.],
and further finds that it is in the
best interest of [R.H.B./J.K.B.] that the
Petition be granted, and it is hereby
ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED
that all parental rights of [Father]
in respect to [R.H.B./J.K.B.] are
terminated forever, and custody of
[child] is hereby awarded to [CYF], ...
which is authorized to consent to the
adoption of [child], and the child may
now be adopted without further consent
or notice to the parents....

<P00>Final Decrees for Involuntary Termination
of Parental Rights, 6/4/24.

<P20>The goal change orders state that the
concurrent placement plan for Children is
adoption and "non-relative" permanent legal
custodian. Orders, 6/4/24.

<P20>On July 1, 2024, Father filed timely
appeals from the decrees and goal change
orders, along with concise statements of
errors pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a)(2)(i).<fnr3>

<P20>Father presents the following question
for our review:

<B22>Did the trial court commit an abuse of
discretion and error of law in finding
that factors other than Father's incarceration
prevented reunification, when
granting the Petition for Termination of
Parental Rights, and changing the Children's
permanency goals[?]

<P00>Father's Brief at 5.

<CN><EM>LAW</EM>

<P20>A trial court may terminate the
"rights of a parent in regard to a child ...
after a petition filed on any of [eleven]
grounds." 23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2511(a). Typically,
and in very general terms, a petitioner
must prove that the parent is unable or
incapable of properly caring for the child,
and has failed to remedy the inability or
incapacity. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> (setting forth specific
grounds for termination). "In evaluating
whether the petitioner proved grounds under
&sect; 2511(a), the court must focus on the
parent's conduct." <EMBI>Int. of M.E.,</EMBI> 283 A.3d
820, 830 (Pa. Super. 2022) (citation omitted).
The petitioner must establish statutory
grounds by clear and convincing evidence,
which is evidence that is so "clear,
direct, weighty, and convincing as to enable
a trier of fact to come to a clear
conviction, without hesitance, of the truth
of the precise facts in issue." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> If the
court finds a petitioner has proven
grounds for termination, it must then "give
primary consideration to the developmental,
<Page 1257>
physical and emotional needs and welfare
of the child." 23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2511(b).

<P20>A trial court decides a dependent
child's placement goal pursuant to the Juvenile
Act, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 6301-65. Section
6351 directs that a court "not only consider
the appropriateness and feasibility of a
child's current goal during the permanency
review hearings, it also mandates that the
court enter an order addressing whether
to continue, modify or terminate placement."
<EMBI>Int. of K.C.,</EMBI> 319 A.3d 596, 600 (Pa.
Super. 2024) (citation omitted).

<P20>This Court reviews appeals from
termination decrees and goal change orders
for an abuse of discretion. The Pennsylvania
Supreme Court has stated:

<B22>[A]ppellate courts must apply an abuse
of discretion standard when considering
a trial court's determination of a petition
for termination of parental rights. As in
dependency cases, our standard of review
requires an appellate court to accept
the findings of fact and credibility
determinations of the trial court if they
are supported by the record. If the factual
findings are supported, appellate
courts review to determine if the trial
court made an error of law or abused its
discretion.

<P00><EMBI>In re Adoption of S.P.,</EMBI> 616 Pa. 309, 47
A.3d 817, 826 (2012) (citations omitted). An
appellate court is not required to accept
the lower court's inferences or conclusions
of law. <EMBI>See In Interest of: L.Z., A Minor
Child,</EMBI> 631 Pa. 343, 111 A.3d 1164, 1174
(2015).

Court has recognized that "`critical rights'
are still at issue in dependency proceedings,

a family's life, the physical and legal custody
of the subject child, and the parents'
respective fitness to obtain or retain such
custody." <EMBI>Int. of J.F.,</EMBI> 308 A.3d 1252, 1260

<CN><EM>ARGUMENTS</EM>

<P20>Father argues his incarceration "was the
sole barrier to participating in services to
work towards reunification with the Children."
Father's Brief at 7. He states that
because of his incarceration, he was unable
"to meaningfully participate in judicial proceedings,
and for the vast majority of the
case, proceedings and hearings were held
in his absence." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
<Page 1258>

<P20>Father explains that "[p]rior to his incarceration,
[he] saw the Children daily, as
he lived with Mother." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 9. He reiterates
that he was precluded from appearing
at hearings, which "continue[d] in his
absence, without an opportunity [for Father]
to question witnesses, assert a position,
or request services and be included in
the permanency plan." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 10.

<P20>Father cites testimony from the August
21, 2023 review hearing, where CYF's attorney
asked CYF caseworker Isabella
Grab the following:

<B22>Q. Let's begin with efforts that you
made to ascertain or obtain [F]ather's
presence for this proceeding.

<B22>A. Yeah. Since [F]ather's incarcerated in
Dauphin [C]ounty[,] there have been
some transportation issues. They apparently
don't do [Z]oom ... and the only
way he's allowed to call in is if he uses
his 15-minute phone call in increments,
which we realize wouldn't work for our
courts. Transportation, though. We've
looked into getting him transported for
court and, again, hasn't been very
smooth. I asked [Father], when I was
able to briefly talk to him on the phone,
if he has a counselor or anyone he talks
to in the prison and he said that [he]
doesn't talk to anybody. He just does his
time to get out, so he didn't have a
connection for me to meet with.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 11 (citing N.T., 8/21/23, at 27-28).
Father claims Ms. Grab's "attempts were
certainly in vain, as Father was no longer
at Dauphin County Prison, but had been
transported to SCI Smithfield. It seems
suspect that there would be a finding of
reasonable efforts, when [CYF] had not
bothered to ascertain Father's actual
whereabouts." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Father adds:

<B22>[T]he trial court allowed the proceedings
to continue without Father's presence
for what equated to more than half of
the dependency, as the petition to terminate
parental rights was filed on April
19, 2024. Of course, the trial court could
not consider any remedial measures taken
by [Father] after that date.

<B22>Father was also not present for the status
review hearing on October 16, 2023.
[CYF's counsel] stated, "I believe [Father]
remains in SCI Camp Hill. We do
not have the ability to make his presence
available here from that facility."
[N.T., 10/16/23, at 4-5.] Never, in any of
the hearings to this point, did any party
offer proof of efforts to secure Father's
participation. Notably, Father had requested
legal counsel prior to the October
16, 2023 hearing.... Despite Father
having requested legal representation,
the proceedings once again continued
without him having an opportunity to
cross examine witnesses, or present evidence
or argument in his favor.

<B22>Finally, on December 11, 2023, a mere
one-hundred-twenty-four days prior to
the filing of the petition to terminate his
parental rights, Father was made available
to participate remotely, though still
without the legal counsel he had requested.

<B22>At the next review [hearing on] March
12, 2024, Father was again not present.
[CYF's counsel] stated, "[F]ather, ... is
not present, I guess the SCI did not
make him available for today's hearing,
but his counsel, Attorney Jason Shirey,
is here...." [N.T., 3/12/24, at 3.] The
hearing, [which was] the final hearing
prior to the termination [hearing], went
on. During the hearing, the [CYF] caseworker
stated that she had contact with
Father, via three-way calls arranged by
<Page 1259>
Paternal Grandmother. The caseworker
would go on to testify that a permanency
meeting was arranged, and that Father
logged into the meeting and waited
in the waiting room. However, the meeting
was rescheduled, without notice to
Father, who again was not able to participate,
a[nd] the meeting went on without
him.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 12-14.

<P20>According to Father, "virtually no efforts
were made to reunify Father with the
Children" despite "his demonstrably short
incarceration[.]" <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 8-9. He stresses
that he lived with Mother and the Children
prior to his incarceration, and cites the
testimony of CYF caseworker Tess Shortt
at the dependency hearing, where Ms.
Shortt responded to CYF's counsel asking:

<B22>Q. To your knowledge, was there any
type of custody agreement involved prior
to [CYF's] involvement?

<B22>A. No. I believe mom and dad are still in
a relationship.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 10 (citing N.T., 2/17/23, at 18).

<P20>Father asserts:

<B22>What fell by the wayside is the fact that
Father resided with the Children, had a
bond with them and was a daily source
of parental care and affection. As he was
not present for the hearing, he had no
opportunity to present evidence or argument
to this effect.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Further, he explains:

<B22>Father was incarcerated in several different
institutions. Thus, he was not in
any one place long enough to complete
any therapeutic programs or services,
despite his making inquiries to do so, as
he testified to on June 4, 2024. During
the dependency action, Father was incarcerated
in the Dauphin County Prison,
moved briefly to SCI Camp Hill,
then to SCI Smithfield, then back to
Camp Hill, then once more to SCI Rockview.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 16 (citation omitted).

<P20>In response, CYF argues the trial
court's decrees and orders are "supported
by competent evidence." CYF's Brief at 18,
22.<fnr4> CYF asserts it made "[r]easonable
efforts ... to finalize the [p]ermanency
[p]lan," but Father "made no progress toward
alleviating the circumstances which
necessitated the original placement." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
11-12, 16, 18. CFY concedes "incarceration
alone cannot constitute grounds for termination,"
but states that Father had a duty
to "foster a continuing relationship" with
Children. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 26 (citing <EMBI>In re A.P.,</EMBI> 692
A.2d 240 (Pa. Super. 1997)). According to
CYF, "[t]he conditions which led to the
placement continue to exist; namely, Father
remains incarcerated." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 18.

<P20>After careful review, we find merit to
Father's argument.

<CN><EM>DISCUSSION</EM>

<HN20><EMUI>Termination of Father's Parental
Rights</EMUI>

<P20>Although the trial court referenced
CYF's alleged grounds for termination at
the conclusion of the termination hearing,
the court did not identify statutory
grounds in the termination decrees. The
court, "being satisfied as to the truth of
<Page 1260>
the facts set forth in the Petition, f[ound
Father] forfeited his parental rights ...
and further f[ound] it is in the best interest
of [R.H.B./J.K.B.] that the Petition be
granted." Decrees, 6/4/24.

<P20>Similarly, in its opinion, the trial court
did not articulate findings regarding
grounds for termination, although it quoted
the statute in its discussion. <EMBI>See</EMBI> TCO at
9-11 (quoting 23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2511(a) and (b)
verbatim); <EMBI>id.</EMBI> at 11 (trial court stating it
"is expected to consider factors outside of
Father's incarceration," and "considered
the totality of the case and the circumstances
that led up the termination hearing").

<P20>CYF alleged grounds for terminating
Father's parental rights pursuant to Section
2511(a)(1), (2), (5), and (8). "This Court
need only agree with any one subsection of
&sect; 2511(a), in addition to &sect; 2511(b)," to
affirm the termination. <EMBI>Int. of M.E.,</EMBI> 283
A.3d at 830 (citation omitted).

<HN20><EM>Subsections 2511(a)(5) and (8)</EM>

<P20>First, we find Father's parental
rights could not be terminated under subsections
2511(a)(5) and (8). Both subsections
provide for termination when the
child "has been removed from the care of
the parent." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> It is undisputed that Children
were not removed from Father's
care. Father was incarcerated when CYF
removed Children from Mother's care.
Thus, the trial court could not terminate
Father's parental rights under subsections
(a)(5) and (8), because those subsections
"are both predicated on removal of the
child from the care of the parent" and
"similarly inapplicable." <EMBI>In re C.S.,</EMBI> 761
A.2d 1197, 1201 n.5 (Pa. Super. 2000) (<EM>en
banc</EM>); <EMBI>id.</EMBI> at 1200 (finding termination of a
father's parental rights under subsections
2511(a)(5) and (8) was "not appropriate"
because the father was incarcerated when
the agency removed the child from the
care of his mother).

<HN20><EM>Subsections 2511(a)(1) and (2)</EM>

<P20>At the conclusion of the June 4, 2024
hearing, the trial court expressed similar
reasoning for terminating Father's rights
under subsections 2511(a)(1) and (2). These
subsections involve a parent's refusal or
failure to perform parental duties, and a
parent's continued incapacity or failure to
parent. Under subsection 2511(a)(1),
grounds for termination exist when:

<B22>(1) The parent by conduct continuing for
a period of at least six months immediately
preceding the filing of the petition
either has evidenced a settled purpose of
relinquishing parental claim to a child or
has refused or failed to perform parental
duties.

<P00>23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2511(a)(1).

<P20>The trial court recognized, "Father in
this case is incarcerated and it's difficult to
perform parental duties while ... incarcerated."
N.T., 6/4/24, at 91. The court
continued:

<B22>On the other hand, the last time that he
had anything to do with [C]hildren really
in person, he was in a car, operating it
and intoxicated and jeopardizing their
lives. Which he denies today, and he
says that he didn't really do anything
wrong actually. And I can't disturb the
conclusion of, you know, the trial that
occurred up in Dauphin County. I mean,
that was &mdash; there was, I guess, a verdict.
So, you know, there's a determination of
guilt that, yes, he did, in fact, do it.

<B22>The standard in that kind of situation,
you know, criminal court is beyond a
reasonable doubt, which is greater than
<Page 1261>
the clear and convincing standard that I
have today.

<B22>So the last time that the Father had
these the children, he was drunk and
jeopardizing their lives by driving
around with them in a motor vehicle. So
that's kind of the starting point, I guess.

<B22>And since then, what has he done to
show that he's not relinquishing his
claim? Well, he had contact with the
caseworker last fall &mdash; in August because
he acknowledged communicating with
Ms. Grab.

<B22>You know, he really hasn't done anything
in terms of getting treatment. I
think that is really a critical issue &mdash; or
one of the major issues that I have
that[,] I guess, what's been offered today
is that he'll pop out of Rockview and
come down to York County and take
these kids under his wing and he'll be
off and running as dad again.

<B22>Not so fast. He's got the [EWOC] and
DUI conviction[s]. He's got essentially
serious ... offenses that involve [C]hildren
as victims. Not just some other
kids, or, you know, some unknown child
in the community that maybe he sped
past in a playground or something.

<B22>These are his own kids, in his own vehicle
while he was drunk and got convicted.
You know, he thought nothing of
doing what he really needed to do with
them [<EM>sic</EM>].

<B22>I just don't find him credible at all. Is he
suffering from substance abuse, or &mdash; I
guess somebody asked, is he in active
addiction. No, not at all. It was fine up
until the time leading up to the kids.

<B22>Well, if you are putting the kids in the
car and driving around with them drunk,
you are not fine and that is a significant
indicator to me that your substance use
is out of control, if you are in a position
where that is a good idea and something
that you think is okay.

<B22>And whether or not, you know, Father
denies that at this point, the problem is
the jury convicted him. So it is what it
is.

<B22>So has he done anything to put himself
in a position where he's not relinquishing
his parental claim? Is he providing
any support? No. He's not able to provide
any support, I guess, because he
can't work and be in jail. No savings
were available for [C]hildren. I guess his
family members were unable to provide
the support or any kind of temporary
shelter from the storm.

<B22>I'm not sure what, in fact, he's done. He
hasn't gotten a risk of harm evaluation
done. There's really nothing that's been
done to move the ball forward for him.

<B22>He would be starting from the very
starting line in this case, and it would be
the day that he walks out of prison. If, in
fact, it is in August, which I have my
doubts on how I read the sentence, but
maybe I'm wrong on that. I don't know.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 91-94.

<P20>The trial court then addressed subsection
2511(a)(2), which provides for termination
when:

<B22>(2) The repeated and continued incapacity,
abuse, neglect or refusal of the parent
has caused the child to be without
essential parental care, control or subsistence
necessary for his physical or
mental well-being and the conditions and
causes of the incapacity, abuse, neglect
or refusal cannot or will not be remedied
by the parent.

<P00>23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2511(a)(2).

<P20>The trial court continued:
<Page 1262>

<B22>The second allegation is that ... repeated,
continuing incapacity of ... the
parent that has caused the child to be
without essential parental care, control
or subsistence necessary for the child's
physical or mental wellbeing[,] and conditions
that cause the incapacity, abuse
or neglect, cannot or will not be remedied
by the parent.

<B22>One of the contributing factors here is
that Father's, I believe unaddressed
substance abuse disorder, related to &mdash; at
least to alcohol. I'll probably never know
because there was no chemical testing
[for] whether there w[ere] any drugs
involved. And I'm not going to take any
surmise of that, but I'll take under serious
consideration that he was, in fact,
convicted of DUI while driving around
with the kids in the car, which suggests
to me more [than] a casual relationship
with alcohol.

<B22>Anybody who chooses to do that &mdash; and it
was a choice &mdash; is involuntarily [<EM>sic</EM>] risking
the lives of his children and other
motorists on the road, in addition to
himself, [and] suggests that his use of
controlled substance or alcohol I should
say, is out of control.

<B22>What has he done to remedy it in the
period since that occurred? Well, apparently
nothing. So that is what I would
definitely consider to be a refusal to do
what is necessary to address the causes
of incapacity, abuse, neglect.

<B22>I think abuse would definitely be something
that I would characterize as consistent
with driving around [in] the car
while you are drunk with kids in the car.
He's done nothing to get treatment for it
and even today he will not acknowledge
the fact that he was [DUI]. That's ...
what the first step is, that acknowledgment.
So I don't believe that he's any
closer to addressing that than he was
the day that he went into jail. He hasn't
provided any support. You know, there's
been very limited contact, et cetera.

<P00>N.T., 6/4/24, at 94-96.

<P20>The trial court based its findings of
grounds for termination under subsections
2511(a)(1) and (2) on Father's DUI and
EWOC convictions, which led the court to
conclude that Father had an "out of control"
and "unaddressed substance abuse
disorder." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 93 (trial court finding
Father's convictions to be "a significant
indicator" that Father's "substance use is
out of control"); <EMBI>id.</EMBI> at 95 (trial court finding
Father's "use of controlled substance
or alcohol ... is out of control," and concluding
Father had done "apparently nothing"
to remedy his "substance abuse disorder").<fnr5>

<P20>The record does not support the
trial court's findings. CYF presented no
evidence that Father had a substance
abuse issue, or that Father was required
or ordered to be evaluated or obtain treatment
for substance abuse. Father was incarcerated
from the time CYF obtained
custody of the Children in February 2023,
to when the trial court entered the termination
<Page 1263>
decrees in June 2024. Ostensibly,
Father did not use drugs or alcohol and
was sober during the 16 months preceding
the hearing.

<P20>The record also reflects that the circumstances
of Father's incarceration, particularly
at Dauphin County Prison, impeded
Father's ability to participate in the dependency
process and perform parental
duties, albeit from prison. The evidence,
including evidence presented by CYF, indicates
that Father encountered obstacles
which restricted his ability, in the words of
the trial court, "to move the ball forward."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 94; <EMBI>see also</EMBI> TCO at 5 (trial court
referencing "Father's communication problems"
at Dauphin County Prison).

<HN20><EM>Father's Family Service Plans</EM>

<P20>At the beginning of the termination
hearing, counsel for CYF stated that the
"only exhibits as it relates to Father[,] are
going to be the family service plans." N.T.,
6/4/24, at 10. Counsel continued:

<B22>More specifically, as it relates to Father
..., we would move for the admission of
[CYF] Exhibit Number 1, which is the
initial family service plan dated March 9,
2023. We would move for the admission
of [CYF] Exhibit Number 2, which is
the updated family service plan dated
August 22, 2023. Finally, we would move
for the admission of [CYF] Exhibit
Number 3, which is the revised family
service plan dated January 16, 2024.
And again, those are exhibits only as it
relates to Father.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 10-11.

<P20>The trial court admitted the family service
plans (FSPs) without objection. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
11. Exhibit 1, the March 9, 2023 FSP,
states that Father's objectives were: (1)
notify the caseworker of any change of
address or phone number; (2) "complete
any classes on parenting or related topics
while incarcerated"; (3) "sign any releases
of information necessary" for CYF; and (4)
notify CYF "of anyone who could be a
resource for" Children. Exhibit 1 at 11, 13.

<P20>Exhibit 2, the August 22, 2023 FSP,
repeats the same objectives: (1) notify
caseworker of any change of address or
phone number; (2) "complete any classes
on parenting or related topics while incarcerated";
(3) "sign any releases of information
necessary" for CYF; and (4) notify
CYF "of anyone who could be a resource
for" Children. Exhibit 2 at 12, 14. Exhibit
2 also contains comments from the caseworker,
Ms. Grab, stating:

<B22>Caseworker has attempted to contact a
representative from Dauphin County
Jail to be able to maintain fluent communication
for court hearings, etc., but
has been unsuccessful.

<B22>Caseworker asked [Father] if he has a
counselor or other person in the jail that
he regularly communicates with, and he
said no.

<B22>[U]pdate 8/22/23-at the expedited hearing
on 8/21, it was known that [Father]
is now in state prison&mdash;Smithfield Correctional
Institution....

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 19.<fnr6>

<P20>Exhibit 3, the January 16, 2024 FSP,
states that "Father remains incarcerated
with an estimated date in August 2024 for
release." Exhibit 3 at 2. Father's objectives
<Page 1264>
were unchanged: (1) notify caseworker of
any change of address or phone number;
(2) "complete any classes on parenting or
related topics while incarcerated"; (3) "sign
any releases of information necessary" for
CYF; and (4) notify CYF "of anyone who
could be a resource for" Children. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
12, 14. In the comments, Ms. Grab stated:

<B22>Update 1/16/24: [Father] is now at SCI
Rockview. Caseworker will reach out to
SCI to ask for a counselor or contact
person to assure that [Father] receives
the invitations to court proceedings and
see if he has applied for an attorney for
court representation. An application for
court appointed counsel was sent to [Father]
and his mother but they have not
confirmed if the application was filled
out and caseworker has not received a
notification from the court to state that
a counsel was appointed.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 19.

<P20>In sum, Father's FSPs do not mention
or contemplate substance abuse; the FSPs
also corroborate Father's claim that he
was unable "to meaningfully participate in
judicial proceedings," and anticipated being
released from prison within three
months of the termination hearing, on August
21, 2024.

<HN20><EM>Caseworker Michelle Royer</EM>

<P20>Next, CYF presented testimony from
Michelle Royer, who testified to being a
"contracted caseworker" for CYF, and "assigned
... to the family" three months
prior, on March 5, 2024. N.T., 6/4/21, at 13-14.
She testified that she visited children
"monthly" in foster placement. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 29.
Ms. Royer also testified that Father's
FSPs were "forwarded" to Father in prison,
although she never confirmed he received
them. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 17, 34.

<P20>Ms. Royer explained that Father was
unable to visit Children "due to being in
prison," and noted Father's "maximum
date" of incarceration of August 21, 2024.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 19-20. She stated that CYF did not
offer Father any services because "[h]e is
incarcerated." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 21, 38. Ms. Royer
opined that Father's incarceration "has
caused [Children] to be without essential
parental care, control and subsistence." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
at 24.<fnr7> Ms. Royer stated, "as far as [she]
kn[e]w," Children had never resided with
Father. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 30-31. When CYF's counsel
asked Ms. Royer if she knew whether "Father
was involved" with raising the Children,
Ms. Royer replied, "I don't have
anything." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 31. She also testified that
the Children did not have a pre-adoptive
resource. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>On cross-examination by Father's counsel,
Ms. Royer reiterated that she did not
confirm Father's receipt of the FSPs. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
at 34. She said, "I have never talked to the
Father." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Ms. Royer noted that Father
had "reached out" to CYF on August 21,
2023, but CYF did not respond. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 40.
She also reiterated that Children did not
have an adoptive resource. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 39.

<HN20><EM>Mother</EM>

<P20>Father's counsel also questioned Mother,
who appeared by Zoom. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 5. Father's
counsel asked Mother:
<Page 1265>

<B22>Q. Prior to [Father's] incarceration, did
he reside with you and [C]hildren?

<B22>A. Yes.

<B22>Q. Was he a daily presence in their
lives?

<B22>A. Yes. He watched them while I went
to work.

<B22>Q. And did he also work?

<B22>A. Yes.

<B22>Q. So that one of you work[ed] dayshift
and the other a nightshift[?]

<B22>A. Yes.

<B22>Q. [S]o there was always someone[?]

<B22>A. Yes, I worked dayshift in a nursing
home and he worked second shift cooking
in a kitchen.

<B22>Q. After his incarceration, did you at any
time facilitate phone or video visits between
Father and [C]hildren?

<B22>A. Yes, I did every day.

<B22>Q. And for how long did that go on?

<B22>A. Until they were taken.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 62-63.

<P20>CYF's counsel asked Mother a single
question:

<B22>Q. When you resided with Father, were
both of you actively engaged in your
addiction issues?

<B22>A. No. I had four years in recovery and
[Father] was also sober.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 63-64.

<HN20><EM>Father</EM>

<P20>Father was transported from SCI Rockview
to appear in person. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 15. Father's
counsel first asked:

<B22>Q. [Father], prior to your incarceration,
did you live with [C]hildren?

<B22>A. Correct.

<B22>Q. You did live with them from birth?

<B22>A. Yes.

<B22>Q. And were you daily present in their
lives prior to your incarceration?

<B22>A. Absolutely.

<B22>Q. I'm going to ask you to speak up into
the microphone?

<B22>A. Absolutely.

<B22>Q. Is it accurate that your absolute release
date is August 21st, 2024?

<B22>A. Sure.

<B22>Q. And that's just a matter of doing the
math from your sentence, correct?

<B22>A. Correct.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 66.

<P20>When Father's counsel showed him CYF
Exhibit 1, the initial FSP dated March 9,
2023, Father stated that he had seen it
when he was incarcerated at Camp Hill.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 67. Father testified that he did not
receive or see the other FSPs. He stated:

<B22>I've gotten mail saying that my stuff
was confiscated and returned to sender
because there was no control number or
something like that[,] along those matters
for legal mail. You have to have a
control number and they weren't sending
mail with a control number on it, so
it was being confiscated and [it was]
returned to sender.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>Regarding contact with CYF, Father
testified:

<B22>The only person that I've ever talked to
was Isabella Grab and I initiated that.
The whole time this has been going on
... other than Ms. Grab[,] and me initiating
that communication and contact, I
feel like I've been shut out.
<Page 1266>

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI>; <EMBI>see also id.</EMBI> at 77 (Father stating, in
response to questioning by the trial court,
that he "was never told anything," and,
"[t]hat's what I'm saying, I've been shut
out. I never have gotten anything other
than &mdash; I got one [FSP]").

<P20>Father explained he was able to call Ms.
Grab because his mother "would three-way
me through [her phone to] the prison
phone." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 74. Referring to caseworkers,
Father stated that CYF "keep[s]
switching them up." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 76.

<P20>Father testified that he was moved from
Dauphin County Prison in August 2023.
His counsel asked:

<B22>Q. And while [incarcerated], did you attempt
to participate in any education or
counseling programs?

<B22>A. SCI or Dauphin County[?]

<B22>Q. First in Dauphin County.

<B22>A. Dauphin County did not have any of
those resources. And I-however you
would go about it, that could be verified

<B22>....

<B22>Q. What about when you were at the
SCI?

<B22>A. They said that because I was so far
over my minimum and close to release
that the programs that they wanted me
to do were a year long and I didn't have
enough time to complete those programs.

<B22>Q. Did you ever reach out to someone at
the facility to try to arrange for these
services? Let me rephrase. Did you ask
to participate in those services?

<B22>A. For what services?

<B22>Q. While at the SCI you mentioned some
classes that weren't available to you.

<B22>A. Yes.

<B22>Q. But you did attempt to participate
... in those, correct?

<B22>A. Correct.

<B22>Q. Have you made any attempts to have
contact with [C]hildren since your incarceration?

<B22>A. Yes. Like I said, I was calling them
on a regular basis every day, talking to
them through [Mother]. And even when
they were ... with [CYF], I was seeing
them through a video trying to figure
out a way to [navigate the dependency
process]. Because, like I said, I was shut
out. I wasn't being taken to court dates.
Nobody was trying to help me be in
contact with [C]hildren, and [Mother] at
the time was the only way to make that
happen. And she said that [CYF] told
her that I needed to worry about myself
and she needs to worry and focus on
herself, and that it's in [my] best interest
... to no longer have video visits
while she was having her visitation time
with the kids.

<B22>Q. Now, when you are released in just
over two months, do you have a plan for
employment?

<B22>A. Yes, sir.

<B22>Q. Can you describe that? ...

<B22>A. I have a job. I work through three
different temp agencies which I'm registered
with. It's very easy, there is always
work. You go in and they've got a
list of stuff. You pick which one you
want, pick which shift you want and they
provide transportation. There are numerous
jobs, but I would probably be
looking to go back to Allen Distributions....

<B22>Q. Could you repeat the last part and be
clear in the microphone where you
would go back to?
<Page 1267>

<B22>A. Allen Distributions.

<B22>Q. And do you have a plan for housing?

<B22>A. Yes, I have a plan for housing. I have
a resource available t[o] me through my
mom's ex-husband, his name is John
Wilson. He works with ... nonprofit
organizations and financial assistance.
And he told me that as long as I ...
provide him with a letterhead from Allen
Distributions, which is already set up,
stating this will be my hourly rate[,] and
this is what I'll be able to make[,] and
this is what my monthly income will be,
he's willing to put me in a place before I
even get the money.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 68-71.

<P20>CYF's counsel and the trial court both
questioned Father:

<B22>[CYF's Counsel]: And while you were
incarcerated at either the state correctional
institution or at Dauphin County,
were there any occasions when you were
required to be segregated?

<B22>[Father's counsel]: I object to the relevance.

<B22>THE COURT: Answer the question.

<B22>THE WITNESS: Was I required to be
segregated?

<B22>THE COURT: Kept out of general population.
Did you ever get yanked out of
general population, when and why?

<B22>THE WITNESS: I got yanked out of
population and found not guilty of a
misconduct. The misconduct was disruptive
behavior and found not guilty.

<B22>THE COURT: And where was that[?]

<B22>THE WITNESS: That was Dauphin
County.

<B22>THE COURT: You said earlier you
were in the hole. I think [CYF's counsel]
was trying to ask about that. You were
in the hole in state prison, what [wa]s
that for?

<B22>THE WITNESS: That's been most recently,
since March 7th[,] I've [been] in
the hole.

<B22>THE COURT: Why?

<B22>THE WITNESS: I think that I told you
that in my letter, that is their form of
protective custody.[<fnr8>] It's a level 5 maximum
security prison &mdash; I mean, housing
unit, and that was my way of choosing to
avoid a situation and stay out of trouble.
I was refusing to go to population because
I didn't want to put myself in a
predicament to have to do something to
somebody, if they did something to me
and vice versa, and looking at a longer
stay or possible street charges or whatever
would have to come out....

<B22>BY [CYF's counsel]:

<B22>Q. So you requested to be placed in that
situation, correct?

<B22>A. Correct....

<B22>Q. At the time that you were arrested,
were you in active addiction?
<Page 1268>

<B22>A. No.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 72-74.

<P20>The trial court continued to question
Father:

<B22>Q. What drugs were you on at the time
you were driving with your kids in the
car?

<B22>A. I wasn't on any drugs, Your Honor. If
alcohol&mdash;

<B22>Q. Alcohol, all right. How much alcohol
was in your system at that time?

<B22>A. The legal limit.

<B22>Q. The legal limit?

<B22>A. Yes.

<B22>Q. So the legal limit would be under .08?

<B22>A. Correct.

<B22>Q. So you were under .08?

<B22>A. I would say so because I didn't have a
lot &mdash; I only had a beer. I didn't have a
lot to drink.

<B22>Q. Did you plead guilty to a DUI?

<B22>A. No.

<B22>Q. Well, what were you sentenced for?
I'm confused here because there was an
endangering welfare charge. Why are
you in jail?

<B22>A. I was found guilty at a jury trial.

<B22>Q. Of what?

<B22>A. DUI and endangering the welfare of
children. But it's general impairment, so
they don't need a blood draw.

<B22>Q. Did you give blood?

<B22>A. No.

<B22>Q. Okay. So the jury convicted you of
DUI, correct?

<B22>A. Correct.

<B22>Q. So that's a fact that I can't overturn
or disturb. But it's your contention today
that you didn't have enough to be
over the legal limit?

<B22>A. Absolutely not.

<B22>Q. Okay. What was your sentence?

<B22>A. My sentence was 18 to 36 months,
Your Honor.

<B22>Q. Okay. And when did you leave Dauphin
County Prison to go to Camp Hill?

<B22>A. August 9th, I believe it was, of 2023.

<B22>Q. All right, where did you go from
there? You went to Camp Hill and then
from Camp Hill where did you go next?

<B22>A. To ... SCI Smithfield.

<B22>Q. And that's in Huntingdon, right?

<B22>A. I believe so, right up the street from
it.

<B22>Q. So Camp Hill to Smithfield. And then
where did you go?

<B22>A. Back to Camp Hill.

<B22>Q. And then where did you go?

<B22>A. SCI Rockview.

<B22>Q. And where you are right now?

<B22>A. SCI Rockview.

<B22>Q. And didn't somebody say you were in
Benner Township?

<B22>A. They said Bellefonte, PA, and then
the paperwork [was] sent to Albion and
I was never at Albion.

<B22>Q. That is why I was confused. It seems
like you must have moved around a lot if
you were in Smithfield, Camp Hill,
Rockview, Benner Township and Albion,
those were different facilities.

<B22>A. No, Your Honor. I went to Camp Hill
... to Smithfield to Camp Hill and then
sent to my home jail, SCI Rockview,
where I've been ever since.

<C5>***
<Page 1269>

<B22>Q. Are there any conditions of your sentence
regarding contact with [C]hildren?

<B22>A. No, sir. And I can get you that documentation.

<B22>Q. Well, it's do or die today because I
have to make a decision today. I mean, it
is what it is.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 79-81, 83.

<P20>Father's counsel then stated, "I would
submit [Father's] Exhibit 1, which is his
sentence of 533 days," and the court admitted
the exhibit into evidence. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 84-85.

<P20>Based on the above evidence, we cannot
conclude that the record supports a finding
of grounds for termination under subsections
2511(a)(1) and (2). There is no evidence
of Father's substance abuse beyond
his DUI conviction,<fnr9> and substance abuse
was not mentioned in his FSPs. The trial
court stated, "It could have helped Father
had he substantiated his claim that he has
no concerns with a substance use disorder.
He did not provide any evidence that he
had a drug and alcohol evaluation that
gave him a clean bill of health." TCO at 14.
The trial court disregards that Father was
not required to address substance abuse in
his FSPs, as well as Father's limited ability
to obtain evidence given his incarceration.
<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> (trial court referencing "limitations
on communications imposed by
Dauphin County Prison").

<P20>Accordingly, the record does not
support a finding that Father, "by conduct
continuing for a period of at least six
months immediately preceding the filing of
the petition[,] either has evidenced a settled
purpose of relinquishing parental
claim to a child or has refused or failed to
perform parental duties." 23 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 2511(a)(1). Given the circumstances of his
incarceration, Father did what little he
could. For example, he had his mother use
three-way calling on her phone so he could
speak with Ms. Grab. N.T., 6/4/24, at 74.
The trial court observed that there "are
many parents that are incarcerated and
still manage to interact and express their
love for their children." TCO at 12.<fnr10> However,
the trial court disregards the "limitations
on communication imposed by Dauphin
County Prison," <EMBI>id.</EMBI> at 5, and the
impact of Father's various transfers between
SCIs.

<P20>Likewise, the record does not support
a finding that Father's "repeated and
continued incapacity, ... has caused [Children]
to be without essential parental care,
... and the causes of the incapacity, ...
<EMB>cannot or will not be remedied by the
parent.</EMB>" 23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2511(a)(2) (emphasis
added).

<P20>Father accurately testified that he
would be released from prison on August
21, 2024. We take judicial notice of the
records of the Pennsylvania Parole Board,
which indicate that Father was released on
August 21, 2024.<fnr11> We also note that Children
did not have an adoptive resource.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> TCO at 6.
<Page 1270>

<P20>We have "long recognized that a
parent is required to make diligent efforts
towards the reasonably prompt assumption
of full parental responsibilities." <EMBI>Int.
of K.M.W.,</EMBI> 238 A.3d 465, 474 (Pa. Super.
2020). Furthermore, "incarceration is a
factor, and indeed can be a determinative
factor, in a court's conclusion that grounds
for termination exist under &sect; 2511(a)(2)[,]
where the repeated and continued incapacity
of a parent due to incarceration has
caused the child to be without essential
parental care[.]" <EMBI>In re Adoption of S.P.,</EMBI> 47
A.3d at 828. Pertinently, "the length of the
remaining confinement can be considered
as highly relevant." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 830.

<P20>We are also cognizant that "[e]ach
case of an incarcerated parent facing termination
must be analyzed on its own
facts, keeping in mind ... that the child's
need for consistent parental care and stability
cannot be put aside or put on hold[.]"
<EMBI>Int. of K.M.W.,</EMBI> 238 A.3d at 474. The Supreme
Court has held:

<B22>Neither subsection [2511](a) nor (b) requires
a court to consider the reasonable
efforts provided to a parent prior to
termination of parental rights. Nevertheless,
this Court has observed that the
provision or absence of reasonable efforts
may be relevant to a court's consideration
of both the grounds for termination
and the best interests of the
child. For example, as applicable to subsection
(a)(2), a court may find an agency's
lack of assistance to a parent relevant
to whether a parent's incapacity
"cannot or will not be remedied by the
parent." 23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2511(a)(2).

<P00><EMBI>In re D.C.D.,</EMBI> 629 Pa. 325, 105 A.3d 662,
672 (2014); <EMBI>see also Interest of T.M.W.,</EMBI>
232 A.3d 937, 950 (Pa. Super. 2020) (finding
agency's lack of assistance was "determinative
in our conclusion that the evidence
was not `so clear, direct, weighty,
and convincing' to prove that ... [the]
causes of [the] mother's incapacity cannot
or will not be remedied by her under
[S]ection 2511(a)(2)").<fnr12>

<P20>Instantly, we conclude the record does
not support termination under subsection
2511(a)(2), or subsections 2511(a)(1), (5)
and (8).<fnr13> Thus, we vacate the decrees terminating
Father's parental rights and remand
for further dependency proceedings.

<HN20><EMUI>Children's Goal Change</EMUI>

<P20>The trial court did not explain its goal
change decision at the hearing. The court
only stated, "I'll change the goal to adoption
at this point." N.T., 6/4/24, at 101. In
its opinion, the court briefly addressed the
goal change, stating:

<B22>Regarding the change of goals, the court
is expected to use its own judgment
when approving a change of goals. The
court[,] having little evidence of improvement
made by [Father,] determined
that it was appropriate to change
the goal of the dependency cases from
reunification to adoption. The court's actions
were not beyond its authority or
reasonable judgment.

<P00>TCO at 11-12.

<P20>The record indicates CYF
made, at most, minimal efforts to reunify
<Page 1271>
Children and Father. An agency "must
redirect its efforts towards placing the
child in an adoptive home only after `the
child welfare agency <EMB>has made reasonable
efforts</EMB> to return a foster child to his or
her biological parent, but those efforts
have failed[.]'" <EMBI>Int. of T.M.W.,</EMBI> 232 A.3d at
947 (emphasis in original) (citing <EMBI>In re
G.P.-R.,</EMBI> 851 A.2d 967 (Pa. Super. 2004)).
For the reasons stated in our discussion of
Father's parental rights, we also conclude
the trial court erred in changing Children's
permanency goals.

<CN><EM>CONCLUSION</EM>

<P20>Because the record does not support the
trial court's decision to terminate Father's
parental rights and change Children's permanency
goals, we vacate the decrees and
orders, and remand the case for the trial
court to resume dependency proceedings.

<P20>Decrees and orders vacated. Case remanded
for further proceedings. Jurisdiction
relinquished.
<FN>
<fnt1> Children's mother, R.G. (Mother), voluntarily
relinquished her parental rights. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T.,
6/4/24, at 5-6. Following a hearing, the trial
court entered decrees confirming her consent
and terminating her parental rights.

<fnt2> Father was awaiting trial in Dauphin County
on charges of driving under the influence
of alcohol (DUI), endangering the welfare of
children (EWOC), and recklessly endangering
another person (REAP). <EMBI>See</EMBI> 75 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 3802(a)(1) and 18 Pa.C.S. &sect;&sect; 4304(a)(1),
2705.

<fnt3> This Court consolidated the appeals on July
30, 2024.

<fnt4> Children's guardian <EM>ad litem</EM> advised she
would not be filing a brief, although she "concurs
with the conclusions" of the trial court.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> "No Brief to be Filed by Appellee" Letter,
9/19/24. Children's legal counsel has not filed
a brief or otherwise communicated with this
Court.

<fnt5> The termination statute addresses instances
when a child is the victim of a parent's crime,
and provides grounds for termination when a
parent has been convicted of homicide or
aggravated assault of a child, or attempt, solicitation
or conspiracy to commit homicide
or aggravated assault of a child. 23 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 2511(a)(9). The statute also provides
grounds for termination when a parent "has
been found ... to have committed sexual
abuse against the child or another child of the
parent." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at &sect; 2511(a)(10). The statute is
silent as to a parent's convictions of other
crimes involving their child, including DUI
and EWOC.

<fnt6> Mother was responsible for the update.
Neither Father nor any counsel for Father
appeared at the hearing. CYF's counsel questioned
Ms. Grab about efforts to "obtain
[F]ather's presence at this proceeding," and
Ms. Grab replied, "in Dauphin [C]ounty
there have been some transportation issues."
N.T., 8/21/23, at 27. While CYF's counsel
continued to question Ms. Grab, asking what
Father "reported ... while he's been at Dauphin
County Prison?", Mother's counsel interjected:
"Your Honor, and [counsel,]
[M]other indicated to me [that Father is no
longer at Dauphin County Prison,] so while
we were sitting here I did pull up VINELink,
he's actually currently at SCI Smithfield.
He's no longer in Dauphin [C]ounty." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at
29-30.

<fnt7> At this point in the testimony, Mother interjected,
"So why doesn't he have a chance?"
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 25.

<fnt8> The record contains a letter from Father
postmarked May 8, 2024 from SCI Rockview,
which Father addressed to the York County
Clerk of Orphans' Court with a note asking
the Clerk to "please make sure [the trial
court] receives the enclosed letter," and requesting
"a copy of the enclosed letter time
stamped and dated so I know your office
received my letter." Correspondence, 5/13/24.
In the postscript, Father stated:

<B22>P.S. I have not been in the hole for being a
knucklehead. I am in the hole for refusing
to go to general population, because I don't
feel safe. Rockview does not have a protective
custody housing unit. The hole is their
protective custody because it is a maximum
security unit. I just wanted to inform you so
you don't think I am being a troublemaker
and haven't changed.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 3.

<fnt9> The trial court docket at CP-22-CR-0000356-2022
indicates that the incident
leading to the conviction occurred in 2022.

<fnt10> The trial court stated that "communications
which were made by Mother ... were
ultimately terminated by her," and "Mother
apparently stopped helping [Father] have contact."
TCO at 7, 12. The record does not
support these statements. Mother testified
that she facilitated "phone or video visits between
Father and [C]hildren ... every day[,
<EMB>u</EMB>]<EMB>ntil they were taken.</EMB>" N.T., 6/4/24, at 63
(emphasis added).

<fnt11> "A judicially noticed fact must be one not
subject to reasonable dispute in that it is ...
capable of accurate and ready determination
by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot
be reasonably questioned." Pa.R.E. 201(b).
Judicial notice can be taken at any time, including
on appeal. Pa.R.E. 201(d) ("The court
may take judicial notice at any stage of the
proceeding.").

<fnt12> Father stated, "there is a difference ...
between refusing to be involved, and being
incapable.... I have NEVER lost an interest
in wanting to be a loving father to [Children]."
Correspondence, 5/13/24.

<fnt13> Because CYF did not prove grounds for
termination under 23 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2511(a), we
need not consider needs and welfare under 23
Pa.C.S. &sect; 2511(b).

[MJ]
<P20>OPINION BY <author>PANELLA</author>, <dgn>P.J.E.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>A.M. ("Mother") appeals from the order
entered on February 13, 2024 in the Court
of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County
adjudicating J.M. (d.o.b. 8/2023) dependent.
After our careful independent review,
we affirm on the basis of the trial
court's opinion.

<P20>The trial court provides a thorough procedural
and factual background in its April
29, 2024 opinion.

<B42>Mother gave birth to J.M. [in] August
[] 2023. J.M. was born prematurely at
twenty-four weeks gestation. Due to
J.M.'s medical fragility, J.M. remained
hospitalized until January 3, 2024.

<B42>On November 19, 2023, [the Philadelphia
Department of Human Services
("DHS")] received a General Protective
Services (GPS) report alleging that
Mother was not visiting J.M. at the hospital.
The report alleged that Mother
needed to be present at the hospital to
learn how to manage J.M.'s medical
needs. Hospital staff communicated to
Mother that J.M. was sick. Mother responded
to hospital staff but she did not
visit J.M. (<EMBI>See</EMBI> Exhibit "A" Statement of
Facts, at &para; 5(b), attached to DHS Dependency
Petition, filed 1/11/24). On November
3, 2023, a meeting was conducted
<Page 1272>
between hospital staff, Mother, and
Maternal Grandmother, N.S. Mother resided
with Maternal Grandmother. The
purpose of the meeting was to address
whether Mother and Maternal Grandmother
were facing barriers in their
abilities to visit J.M. Hospital staff were
told that Mother was not employed or
enrolled in school. Hospital staff informed
Mother they expected her to
visit J.M. on a daily basis. Bus passes
were offered to help overcome any
transportation barriers. (<EMBI>See id.</EMBI>).

<B42>At the November 3, 2023 meeting,
hospital staff did not perceive Mother to
be appropriately concerned about J.M.
After the meeting, and prior to the filing
of the GPS report, Mother only visited
J.M. on two occasions&mdash;November 8,
2023, at 12:00 [A]M and November 14,
2023, at 10:00 PM. Hospital staff were
unaware why Mother was not visiting
J.M. on a daily basis and were concerned
about the infrequency of Mother's
visits. DHS determined the GPS
report to be valid. (<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at &para; 5(c)).

<B42>DHS attempted to visit Mother at her
home on November 22, 2023, but she
was not there at the time. DHS visited
again on December 2, 2023, and was able
to speak with Mother and Maternal
Grandmother to address visitation concerns.
DHS asserted that, at this point
in time, Mother had only visited J.M. in
the hospital eight times. (<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at
&para;&para; 5(d)-(e)).

<B42>DHS held a Crisis/Rapid Response
Meeting on December 8, 2023. Mother,
Maternal Grandmother and DHS attended
the meeting. DHS provided
Mother with a list of training sessions
that she needed to complete, including
training regarding feeding, administering
medications, and learning cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR). (<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at
&para; 5(f)).

<B42>By January 3, 2024, J.M. was ready to
be discharged from the hospital. At this
point, Mother did not provide certification
of completion of the trainings requested
at the December 8, 2023 meeting.
Mother only visited J.M. four times
between December 8, 2023 and January
3, 2024. (<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at &para;&para; 5(g)-(h)).

<B42>Contemporaneously with J.M.'s discharge,
DHS obtained an [Order of Protective
Custody ("OPC")] on the grounds
that Mother was not visiting J.M., Mother
and J.M. had not formed a bond,
Mother needed to undergo training, and
Mother had not demonstrated an adequate
parenting capacity. As a result of
the OPC, J.M. was placed in medical
foster care through Delta Community
Supports, Inc. (<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at &para; 5(h)).

<B42>A shelter care hearing was held on
January 5, 2024, where J.M.'s temporary
commitment to DHS was ordered to
stand. Mother was ordered to have twice
weekly, two-hour visits with J.M. at his
placement. Mother was also invited to
participate in J.M.'s medical appointments.
[J.M. remains medically needy,
requiring follow-up appointments in cardiology,
ophthalmology, and St. Christopher's
Hospital for Children's Developmental
Pediatrics.] (<EMBI>See id.</EMBI> at &para; 5(i)-(j)).

<B42>DHS filed a Dependency Petition for
J.M. on January 11, 2024. The petition
asked the court to adjudicate J.M. dependent,
commit J.M. to DHS, and order
the disposition best suited to the
welfare of J.M. The hearing on the Dependency
Petition was held before this
court on February 13, 2024. At the conclusion
of the hearing, this court found
clear and convincing evidence to adjudicate
J.M. dependent. J.M. was fully committed
<Page 1273>
to DHS based on the finding of
present inability of Mother to provide
proper parental care and control. J.M.
was to remain in medical foster care
through Delta Community Supports,
Inc. (<EMBI>See</EMBI> Order of Adjudication and Disposition,
2/13/24). Mother filed her Notice
of Appeal with Statement of Errors
Complained on March 14, 2024.

<P00>Trial Court Opinion, 4/29/24, at 1-3 (unnecessary
capitalization omitted; some record
citation formatting provided).

<P20>Mother raises five questions for this
Court's review:

<B22>1. Did the trial court err as a matter of
law and abuse its discretion by adjudicating
J.M. to be a "dependent child"
pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.[A.] &sect; 6302 in the
absence of clear and convincing evidence
that J.M. was presently "without proper
parental care and control ... as required
by law?"

<B22>2. Did the trial court err as a matter of
law and abuse its discretion by adjudicating
J.M. to be a "dependent" child
pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.[A.] &sect; 6302 and
removing J.M. from his Mother's custody,
and relying, at least in part, on
improperly shifting onto Mother A.M.
the burden to prove to the court that
she can provide J.M. with proper parental
care and control?

<B22>3. Did the trial court err as a matter of
law and abuse its discretion by committing
J.M. to the legal custody of the
Philadelphia Department of Human Services
in the absence of clear and convincing
evidence that removal from
Mother A.M. was clearly necessary?

<B22>4. Did the trial court err as a matter of
law and abuse its discretion by finding
that the Philadelphia Department of Human
Services made reasonable efforts to
prevent or eliminate the need for removal
of J.M. from his home?

<B22>5. Did the trial court err as a matter of
law and abuse its discretion by ordering
that J.M. should be placed in medical
foster care in the absence of clear and
convincing evidence that medical foster
care was the least restrictive placement
available?

<P00>Appellant's Brief, at 3-4 (answers and suggested
answers omitted).

<P20>Our standard of review in this matter is
well settled:

<B42>The standard of review in dependency
cases requires an appellate court to accept
the findings of fact and credibility
determinations of the trial court if they
are supported by the record, but does
not require the appellate court to accept
the lower court's inferences or conclusions
of law. Accordingly, we review for
an abuse of discretion.

<P00><EMBI>Interest of R.B.,</EMBI> 323 A.3d 828, 832 (Pa.
Super. 2024) (citation and brackets omitted).

<P20>The Juvenile Act defines a "dependent
child," in pertinent part, as a child who:

<B22>(1) is without proper parental care or
control, subsistence, education as required
by law, or other care or control
necessary for his physical, mental, or
emotional health, or morals. A determination
that there is a lack of proper
parental care or control may be based
upon evidence of conduct by the parent,
guardian or other custodian that places
the health, safety or welfare of the child
at risk[.]

<P00>42 Pa.C.S.A. &sect; 6302(1); <EMBI>see also In the
Interest of J.M.,</EMBI> 166 A.3d 408, 417 (Pa.
Super. 2017) (same). "The question of
whether a child is lacking proper parental
<Page 1274>
care and control so as to be a dependent
child encompasses two discrete questions:
whether the child presently is without
proper care or control, and if so, whether
such care and control are immediately
available." <EMBI>In Interest of K.S.,</EMBI> 159 A.3d
535, 538 (Pa. Super. 2017) (citation omitted).
It is the petitioner's burden to present
clear and convincing evidence, i.e., evidence
that is "so clear, direct, weighty and
convincing as to enable the trier of fact to
come to a clear conviction, without hesitance,
of the truth of the precise facts in
issue." <EMBI>Interest of A.M.,</EMBI> 256 A.3d 1263,
1270 (Pa. Super. 2021) (citation omitted).
An adjudication of dependency may be
based on prognostic evidence&mdash;which involves
predicting the child's safety, well-being,
and permanency&mdash;"and such evidence
is sufficient to meet the strict burden
of proof necessary to declare a child
dependent." <EMBI>In re E.B.,</EMBI> 83 A.3d 426, 433
(Pa. Super. 2013) (citation omitted).

<P20>As this Court observed in <EMBI>E.B.</EMBI>:

<B22>In <EMBI>Matter of DeSavage,</EMBI> 241 Pa.Super.
174, 360 A.2d 237 (1976), this Court rejected
the argument that a child cannot
be adjudicated dependent unless the
child is actually in custody of the parents
and they are shown unable to render
care or control as defined in the
Juvenile Act. We explained:

<B64>Obviously, state interference with a
parent-child relationship is a most serious
intrusion ... such an intrusion is
properly tolerated only in cases in
which the Commonwealth sustains a
very strict burden of proof.... The
rule of law appellants request us to
announce is overly restrictive. The
legislature defined ["dependent child"]
in exceedingly broad terms precisely
because it is impossible to foresee all
the possible factual situations that
may arise. Further the broad definition
enables the experienced juvenile
court judge to apply his training and
compassion to the unique facts of each
case. The proposition asserted by appellants
would compel the juvenile
court judge to place the child in the
home of the natural parents to determine
whether they are able to render
proper care, and ignores the possibility
that if the "experiment" proves unsuccessful,
the consequences to the
child could be seriously detrimental or
even fatal.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 433 (quoting <EMBI>DeSavage,</EMBI> 360 A.2d at
241-42).

<P20>After reviewing the record, the parties'
briefs, and the Honorable Brian McLaughlin's
well-reasoned Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion,
we conclude Mother's issues merit no
relief. The trial court's decision belies
Mother's claims that the court abused its
discretion, improperly shifted the burden
of proof, or failed to properly consider the
evidence before it. In addressing Mother's
issues, the April 29, 2024 opinion sets forth
the plethora of evidence and credible,
prognostic testimony that Mother's present
inability to provide proper parental
care and control for J.M. creates a substantial
risk that J.M. would suffer detrimental
or even fatal consequences if left in
Mother's care. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Trial Court Opinion,
4/29/24, at 5-10. The decision also fully
addresses the court's findings that DHS
made reasonable efforts to prevent J.M.'s
removal from Mother's home and that
medical foster care was the least restrictive
placement available. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Trial Court
Opinion, 4/29/24, at 10-13.

<P20>We affirm on the basis of the trial
court's comprehensive April 29, 2024 opinion.

<P20>Order affirmed.

<CN><EMBU>OPINION</EMBU>

<P20>A.M. ("Mother"), Appeals from the Order
entered by this Court on February 13,
2024, adjudicating J.M. dependent pursuant
to the Juvenile Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A.
&sect; 6302. In response to this Order, Mother,
by and through her counsel, filed a Notice
of Appeal with a Statement of Errors
Complained of on Appeal on March 14,
2024.

<HN00><EMBU>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</EMBU>

<P20>Mother gave birth to J.M. on August
[Redacted], 2023. J.M. was born prematurely
at twenty-four weeks gestation. Due
to J.M.'s medical fragility, J.M. remained
hospitalized until January 3, 2024.

<P20>On November 19, 2023, DHS received a
General Protective Services (GPS) report
alleging that Mother was not visiting J.M.
at the hospital. The report alleged that
Mother needed to be present at the hospital
to learn how to manage J.M.'s medical
needs. Hospital staff communicated to
Mother that J.M. was sick. Mother responded
to hospital staff but she did not
visit J.M. (Exhibit "A" Statement of Facts,
attached to DHS Dependency Petition,
filed 1/11/24).

<P20>On November 3, 2023, a meeting was
conducted between hospital staff, Mother,
and Maternal Grandmother, N.S. Mother
resided with Maternal Grandmother. The
purpose of the meeting was to address
whether Mother and Maternal Grandmother
were facing barriers in their abilities to
visit J.M. Hospital staff were told that
Mother was not employed or enrolled in
school. Hospital staff informed Mother
they expected her to visit J.M. on a daily
basis. Bus passes were offered to help
overcome any transportation barriers. (Exhibit
"A" Statement of Facts, attached to
DHS Dependency Petition, filed 1/11/24).

<P20>At the November 3, 2023 meeting, hospital
staff did not perceive Mother to be
appropriately concerned about J.M. After
the meeting, and prior to the filing of the
GPS report, Mother only visited J.M. on
two occasions&mdash;November 8, 2023, at 12:00
PM and November 14, 2023, at 10:00 PM.
Hospital staff were unaware why Mother
was not visiting J.M. on a daily basis and
were concerned about the infrequency of
Mother's visits. DHS determined the GPS
report to be valid. (Exhibit "A" Statement
of Facts, attached to DHS Dependency
Petition, filed 1/11/24).

<P20>DHS attempted to visit Mother at her
home on November 22, 2023, but she was
not there at the time. DHS visited again
on December 2, 2023, and was able to
speak with Mother and Maternal Grandmother
to address visitation concerns.
DHS asserted that, at this point in time,
Mother had only visited J.M. in the hospital
<Page 1276>
eight times. (Exhibit "A" Statement of
Facts, attached to DHS Dependency Petition,
filed 1/11/24).

<P20>DHS held a Crisis/Rapid Response
Meeting on December 8, 2023. Mother,
Maternal Grandmother and DHS attended
the meeting. DHS provided Mother with a
list of training sessions that she needed to
complete, including training regarding
feeding, administering medications, and
learning cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR). (Exhibit "A" Statement of Facts,
attached to DHS Dependency Petition,
filed 1/11/24).

<P20>By January 3, 2024, J.M. was ready to
be discharged from the hospital. At this
point, Mother did not provide certification
of completion of the trainings requested at
the December 8, 2023 meeting. Mother
only visited J.M. four times between December
8, 2023 and January 3, 2024. (Exhibit
"A" Statement of Facts, attached to
DHS Dependency Petition, filed 1/11/24).

<P20>Contemporaneously with J.M.'s discharge,
DHS obtained an OPC on the
grounds that Mother was not visiting J.M.,
Mother and J.M. had not formed a bond,
Mother needed to undergo training, and
Mother had not demonstrated an adequate
parenting capacity. As a result of the OPC,
J.M. was placed in medical foster care
through Delta Community Supports, Inc.
(Exhibit "A" Statement of Facts, attached
to DHS Dependency Petition, filed
1/11/24).

<P20>A shelter care hearing was held on January
5, 2024, where J.M.'s temporary commitment
to DHS was ordered to stand.
Mother was ordered to have twice weekly,
two-hour visits with J.M. at his placement.
Mother was also invited to participate in
J.M.'s medical appointments. (Exhibit "A"
Statement of Facts, attached to DHS Dependency
Petition, filed 1/11/24).

<P20>DHS filed a Dependency Petition for
J.M. on January 11, 2024. The petition
asked the Court to adjudicate J.M. dependent,
commit J.M. to DHS, and order the
disposition best suited to the welfare of
J.M. The hearing on the Dependency Petition
was held before this Court on February
13, 2024. At the conclusion of the
hearing, this Court found clear and convincing
evidence to adjudicate J.M. dependent.
J.M. was fully committed to DHS
based on the finding of present inability of
Mother to provide proper parental care
and control. J.M. was to remain in medical
foster care through Delta Community Supports,
Inc. (Order of Adjudication and Disposition, 2/13/24).
Mother filed her Notice
of Appeal with Statement of Errors Complained
on March 14, 2024.

<HN00><EMBU>STATEMENT OF MATTERS COMPLAINED
OF ON APPEAL</EMBU>

<P20>In Mother's Statement of Matters Complained
of on Appeal, she raises the following
issues:

<B24>1. The trial court erred as a matter of
law and abused its discretion by adjudicating
J.M. to be a "dependent
child" pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6302
in the absence of clear and convincing
evidence that J.M. was presently
"without proper parental care and
control ... as required by law."

<B24>2. The trial court erred as a matter of
law and abused its discretion by
committing J.M. to the legal custody
of the Philadelphia Department of
Human Services in the absence of
clear and convincing evidence that
removal from Mother A.M. was necessary.
<Page 1277>

<B24>3. The trial court erred as a matter of
law and abused its discretion by adjudicating
J.M. to be a "dependent"
child pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6302
and removing J.M. from his Mother's
custody, and relying, at least in
part, on improperly shifting onto
Mother the burden to prove to the
court that she can provide J.M. with
proper parental care and control.

<B24>4. The trial court erred as a matter of
law and abused its discretion by
finding that the Philadelphia Department
of Human Services made
reasonable efforts to prevent or
eliminate the need for removal of
J.M. from his home.

<B24>5. The trial court erred as a matter of
law and abused its discretion by ordering
that J.M. should be placed in
medical foster care in the absence of
clear and convincing evidence that
medical foster care was the least
restrictive placement available.

<HN00><EMBU>DISCUSSION</EMBU>

<P20>A dependency trial is a two-stage process.
The first stage requires the trial
court to hear evidence and determine, by
clear and convincing evidence, that the
child is without proper parental care, control,
or subsistence necessary for the
child's physical, mental, moral, or emotional
health. <EMU>In re A.B.</EMU>, 63 A.3d 345, 349 (Pa.
Super. Ct. 2013). "Clear and convincing
evidence" has been defined as testimony
by credible witnesses who clearly relate
facts that are "so clear, direct, weighty,
and convincing as to enable the trier of
fact to come to a clear conviction, without
hesitancy of the truth of precise facts in
issue." <EMU>In Interest of J.M.</EMU>, 166 A.3d 408,
423 (Pa. Super. 2017) (<EM>citing</EM> <EMU>In re Novosielski</EMU>,
605 Pa. 508, 992 A.2d 89, 107
(2010)).

<P20>If the trial court finds the child dependent,
the trial court may move to the
second stage, in which it must make an
appropriate disposition based upon the inquiry
into the best interest of the child. <EMU>In
the Interest of L.C.</EMU>, 900 A.2d 378, 381 (Pa.
Super. 2006); <EM>See</EM> <EMU>In the Interest of A.E.</EMU>,
722 A.2d 213, 215 (Pa. Super. 1998). Once a
child is adjudicated dependent, the issues
of custody and continuation of foster care
are determined by the child's best interests.
<EMU>In Interest of Sweeney</EMU>, 393 Pa.Super.
437, 574 A.2d 690, 691 (1990). The trial
court may remove a child from the care of
the child's parents only upon a showing of
clear necessity. <EMU>In re E.P.</EMU>, 841 A.2d 128,
132 (Pa. Super. 2003). Before the trial
court can enter any order of disposition
that would remove a dependent child from
their home, the court must determine that,
prior to placement, reasonable efforts were
made to prevent or eliminate the need for
the removal of the child from the home. 42
Pa.C.S. &sect; 6351(b)(2). The burden of proof
in a dependency proceeding is on the petitioner.
<EMU>In re C.R.S.</EMU>, 696 A.2d 840, 842-43
(Pa. Super. 1997).

<HN24><EMB>1-3.</EMB> <EMBU>The Court's determination that
DHS met its burden of proof
that there was Clear and Convincing
Evidence to adjudicate
J.M. dependent due to absence of
proper parental care and control,
as well as the necessity of removing
J.M. from Mother, was
not erroneous or an abuse of discretion.</EMBU>

<P20>A "Dependent Child" will be adjudicated
dependent if the trial court determines by
clear and convincing evidence that Child is
without proper parental care or control,
<Page 1278>
subsistence, education, as required by law,
or other care or control necessary for
Child's physical, mental, and emotional
health or morals. <EMU>In the Interest of J.M.</EMU>,
166 A.3d at 417 (Pa. Super. 2017). A determination
that there is a lack of proper
parental care or control may be based
upon evidence of conduct by the parent,
guardian, or other custodian. The Superior
Court has defined proper parental care as
the care which is geared to the particularized
needs of the child and, at a minimum,
is likely to prevent serious injury to the
child. <EMU>In re C.R.S.</EMU>, 696 A.2d 840, 843 (Pa.
Super. 1997) (<EM>citing</EM> <EMU>In Interest of Justin
S.</EMU>, 375 Pa.Super. 88, 543 A.2d 1192, 1200
(1988)).

<P20>The purpose of the Juvenile Act is to
preserve the unity of the family whenever
possible. 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 6301(b)(1). Nonetheless,
a child will be adjudicated dependent
when the child is presently without proper
parental care, and the care is not immediately
available. <EMU>In re R.T.</EMU>, 405 Pa.Super.
156, 592 A.2d 55, 57 (1991) (<EM>citing</EM> <EMU>In re
LaRue</EMU>, 244 Pa.Super. 218, 366 A.2d 1271
(1976)). A parent may not be separated
from their child unless the Court finds
necessity for separation, which is implicated
where the welfare of the child demands
a removal from parental custody. <EMU>In re
G.T. (Appeal of S.S.)</EMU>, 845 A.2d 870, 873
(Pa. Super. 2004).

<P20>Mother alleges that this Court ruled in
error by adjudicating J.M. dependent
based on Mother's present inability to provide
proper parental care and control, asserting
that DHS failed to present clear
and convincing evidence to support that
finding. This Court disagrees.

<P20>At the hearing on February 13, 2024,
Maria Sierra-Ortiz, a social worker from
Temple University Hospital, testified that
Mother gave birth to J.M. at twenty-four
weeks gestation on August [Redacted],
2023. (N.T., 2/13/24, p. 24). J.M, had significant
medical needs and was hospitalized
for the first one hundred and thirty three
(133) days of his life. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 24-25).
Ms. Sierra Ortiz testified she met with
Mother on August 24, 2023 in anticipation
of the challenges associated with caring for
a premature baby and to ensure that
Mother was prepared to raise J.M. (N.T.,
2/13/24, pp. 24-25, 34). Ms. Siena-Ortiz also
testified that CPR training is essential for
mothers of prematurely born infants.
(N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 36).

<P20>Ms. Siena-Ortiz testified that Mother
was informed about the necessity of visiting
her infant each day. However, Ms.
Sierra-Ortiz testified it was later brought
to her attention that Mother was not visiting
J.M. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 25). Ms. Siena-Ortiz
testified that she initially contacted
Mother over the phone regarding the reasons
she had not been visiting. Mother
stated she had been sick and she intended
to be coming back in for the visits. (N.T.,
2/13/24, pp. 25-26).

<P20>Ms. Sierra-Ortiz testified Mother's pattern
of failing to visit J.M. continued. A
meeting was scheduled on November 3,
2023 to address those concerns. (N.T.,
2/13/24, p. 27). Present at the meeting was
Ms. Sierra-Ortiz, Mother, Maternal Grandmother,
a neonatologist, and a nurse.
(N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 27-28). The group assessed
whether barriers were present hindering
Mother's ability to visit. The medical
professionals also wanted to make sure
Mother was comfortable in asking any
questions. (N.T., 2/13/24, p. 28).

<P20>At the meeting, Mother stated she was
not employed or enrolled in any schooling.
(N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 30). As to barriers for
visitation, Ms. Sierra-Ortiz testified Mother
stated Maternal Grandmother was her
<Page 1279>
source of transportation. This source of
transportation was not always reliable due
to Maternal Grandmother working. (N.T.,
2/13/24, pp. 28-29). Ms. Siena-Ortiz testified
that bus passes and Ubers were offered
and provided to Mother. (N.T.,
2/13/24, pp. 28-29). Ms. Sierra-Ortiz also
testified that visitation was available
"24/7". (N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 36).

<P20>Following the meeting on November 3,
2023, Ms. Sierra-Ortiz testified Mother visited
J.M. only two times in the next sixteen
days, each time at a late hour past 10
o'clock. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 30-31). This infrequency
of visitation was the main concern
which prompted the hospital to contact
and involve DHS with J.M. (N.T.,
2/13/24, pp. 41-42). Ms. Sierra-Ortiz testified
the hospital needs to ensure mothers
are comfortable understanding and caring
for a premature baby. This was never able
to take place with Mother. (N.T., 2/13/24,
p. 37).

<P20>The DHS worker assigned to the matter,
Sharron Burke, also testified at the
hearing. Ms. Burke stated DHS received a
GPS report about J.M. on November 19,
2023. The basis of the report was inadequate
nurturing, which means no bond or
connection between Mother and child, and
Mother did not demonstrate parental capacities
for the child. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 44-45).

<P20>When Ms. Burke spoke to Mother on
November 29, 2023 at a meeting at Maternal
Grandmother's house, she inquired
about the barriers preventing Mother from
visiting with J.M. (N.T., 2/13/24, p. 47). Ms.
Burke testified Mother said to her "she
was sick, and that she was doing music in
the studio." (N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 47-48). Ms.
Burke testified she also asked Maternal
Grandmother about visitations, to which
she mentioned that she was also sick and
her car had broken down, and she was
going to get it fixed soon. (N.T., 2/13/24,
pp. 49). Maternal Grandmother also mentioned
to Ms. Burke that Mother had a
confrontation with a hospital staff member
and that was a reason Mother had been
going to visit late at night to avoid that
hospital staff. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 49-50).

<P20>Ms. Burke testified it was her understanding
J.M. was born at twenty four (24)
weeks and was medically fragile. (N.T.,
2/13/24, pp. 50). J.M. was tiny and he
needed a lot of medical appointments that
needed to be attended. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp.
50). Ms. Burke stated that is why it was
important for Mother to attend daily visits
with J.M. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 50). Ms.
Burke testified she stressed upon Mother,
in the presence of Maternal Grandmother,
that daily hospital visits were necessary.
(N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 50).

<P20>Ms. Burke testified that on January 3,
2024, the same day J.M. was to be discharged
from the hospital, an OPC was
obtained. (N.T., 2/13/24, p. 52). The OPC
was obtained due to insufficient parenting
capacities, an absence of a mother-child
bond, a failure to complete trainings to
care for J.M., and a lack of visitation.
(N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 52).

<P20>By the time J.M. was discharged from
the hospital, the testimony was Mother
had only visited J.M. eight to nine times
over the course of his one hundred thirty
three (133) day hospitalization (N.T.,
2/13/24, pp. 32, 34-35). These visits were
recorded by the hospital (N.T., 2/13/24, pp.
40). Mother testified she visited more
times but she used a wristband and was let
into the hospital without checking in.
(N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 108). Maternal Grandmother,
who accompanied Mother to her
visits, testified the number of visitations
were about forty. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 120-121).

<P20>Sinamon Bethea, J.M.'s assigned CUA
case manager, testified at the hearing as to
the single case plan objectives that were
<Page 1280>
created for Mother. She testified Mother
was to attend all of J.M.'s medical appointments,
complete all medical trainings
needed, sign all consents as needed, reach
out to CUA if in need of transportation to
medical appointments, confirm and attend
all visits, attend and comply with family
school, attend and comply with a domestic
violence consult, and attend and participate
in services at ARC. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp.
71).

<P20>Ms. Bethea testified these single case
plan objectives had not been met by Mother
at the time of the adjudicatory hearing.
No certification was ever presented to
DHS or this Court regarding Mother's
completion of CPR training. (N.T., 2/13/24,
pp. 68-69). Since J.M.'s discharge, J.M. had
attended eight medical appointments.
Mother was invited to each of them, but
she only attended two. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp.
68-69). Mother was provided with a referral
to family school, but no confirmation on
attendance was presented. (N.T., 2/13/24,
pp. 73). Mother attended only three of the
five visits with J.M. that had been offered
to her. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 75).

<P20>This Court found the testimony of Ms.
Sierra-Ortiz, Ms. Burke, and Ms. Bethea
to be credible. The Court found, based on
this testimony, that there is clear and convincing
evidence that Mother is not presently
able to provide the proper care and
control necessary to support J.M.'s physical,
mental, moral, and emotional health.
This is due to J.M. being an infant with
significant medical needs and Mother's
failure to visit J.M. while he was hospitalized
to bond with and learn how to care for
her prematurely born child. Mother was
repeatedly given opportunities to provide
herself with the skills necessary to care for
these needs and Mother failed to provide
herself with these skills. Mother also failed
to obtain a certification in CPR and attend
family school classes.

<P20>Mother testified she visited J.M. more
than eight to nine times, and Maternal
Grandmother maintained that the number
of visits was closer to forty. Even accepting
this testimony as true, if Mother visited
J.M. forty times, she would have only
visited him roughly one third of the days
she was required to, which this Court finds
insufficient. Even after barriers were addressed
by hospital staff and DHS, and
solutions were offered to ensure Mother
could visit J.M., she still failed to do so.
Additionally, after J.M.'s discharge, Mother
was invited to attend J.M.'s medical
appointments, yet she only attended two
out of eight. This lack of visitation, demonstration
of care, and preparation for J.M.'s
medical needs leaves this Court deeply
concerned for the safety of J.M. should he
reside with his Mother.

<P20>Based on all of these reasons, the Court
found clear and convincing evidence to adjudicate
J.M. dependent based on Mother's
present inability to provide proper parental
care and control. The Court found clear
and convincing evidence that such removal
was clearly necessary for the welfare of
the child. Additionally, the Court found
DHS had met its burden of proof and did
not shift any burden of proof onto Mother
to prove that she can provide J.M. with
proper parental care and control.

<HN24><EMB>4-5.</EMB> <EMBU>This Court did not err as a matter
of law or abuse its discretion
by finding that DHS made reasonable
efforts to prevent or
eliminate the need for removal
of J.M. from his home, nor did
this Court err as a matter of law
or abuse its discretion in determining
that medical foster care
was the least restrictive placement
available.</EMBU>

<P20>Mother alleges this Court erred as a
matter of law and abused its discretion by
<Page 1281>
finding that DHS made reasonable efforts
to prevent or eliminate the need for removal
of J.M. from his home. Mother also
alleges this Court erred as a matter of law
and abused its discretion through ordering
J.M.'s placement in medical foster care in
the absence of clear and convincing evidence
that medical foster care was the
least restrictive placement available. This
Court disagrees with Mother's allegations.

<P20>For the reasons previously discussed,
the Court found there is clear and convincing
evidence Mother is not presently able
to provide the proper care and control
necessary to support J.M.'s physical, mental,
moral, and emotional health. Ms.
Burke testified J.M.'s Father, R.R., is incarcerated.
(N.T., 2/13/24, p. 53). Ms. Bethea
testified that Paternal Grandmother
allegedly disputes whether J.M. is even the
child of Father. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 79-80).
Ms. Burke testified that a maternal aunt
was contacted by DHS about the possibility
of serving as a placement resource.
(N.T., 2/13/24, p. 51). Ms. Burke stated the
maternal aunt agreed to be a resource but
later declined after speaking with her husband.
(N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 51).

<P20>Likewise, a maternal uncle was considered,
but he lived "down south," meaning
that he was not an option to be a placement
resource. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 51). Additionally,
Ms. Burke testified Maternal
Grandmother was not a viable option to
serve as a resource considering Mother
lived with Maternal Grandmother, the two
were together at all meetings stressing the
necessity of visitation, Maternal Grandmother
was the source of transportation
for Mother, and Maternal Grandmother,
too, failed to visit J.M. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp.
53). According to Ms. Burke, because Maternal
Grandmother did not demonstrate
herself to be a strong support for Mother,
a safety plan was not pursued in lieu of an
OPC. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 59-60).

<P20>Prior to obtaining the OPC, Ms. Burke
testified to have stressed to Mother and
Maternal Grandmother the importance of
her visitations because nobody else was
available to serve as a placement resource
for J.M. (N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 52). J.M. was
later placed in medical foster care because
of his frequency of medical appointments
and the unavailability of a person to take
him to these appointments. (N.T., 2/13/24,
pp. 66).

<P20>After J.M.'s discharge from the hospital,
eight medical appointments were scheduled
on his behalf. Mother was invited to
each of these but only attended two. (N.T.,
2/13/24, pp. 68-69). Mother was required to
receive CPR training upon J.M.'s discharge,
but she never provided any certification
of receiving such training. Similarly,
she was asked to attend family school but
certification of attendance was never provided.
(N.T., 2/13/24, pp. 68-69).

<P20>The Court found the testimony of Ms.
Burke to be credible. In light of this testimony,
this Court found reasonable efforts
were made to prevent or eliminate the
need for removal. This Court heard meetings
were scheduled to remove barriers
contributing to Mother's failure to visit
J.M. and to teach Mother how to care for
J.M.'s sensitive medical needs. This Court
finds that reasonable efforts were made by
DHS to accommodate for Mother's barriers
to visitation, but Mother still failed to
visit J.M. despite these accommodations.

<P20>This Court also finds, after reasonable
efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for
removal were made, medical foster care
was a necessary placement for J.M. This
Court heard J.M, was still medically needy
after his January 3, 2023, discharge from
<Page 1282>
the hospital and he needed to attend medical
appointments. This Court heard Mother
was aware of these appointments, was
asked to attend, but only attended two of
the eight appointments.

<P20>This Court is not inclined to find Mother
is presently capable of scheduling J.M.'s
medical appointments and bringing him to
these appointments for future care. Additionally,
Mother did not provide certification
of completion of CPR training or family
school. This Court makes the factual
determination, after assessing the credibility
of the witnesses, these trainings were
not completed. As such, there is a significant
concern for J.M.'s medical wellbeing
should he live with Mother.

<P20>This Court heard J.M.'s Father is incarcerated
and incapable of caring for J.M.
Paternal Grandmother disputes whether
Father is the biological father of J.M. and
she is not presently available to serve as a
resource for J.M. Likewise, in assessing
Maternal Grandmother's presence
throughout these events, this Court finds
Maternal Grandmother has demonstrated
she is not presently suited to care for J.M.
and a safety plan was not feasible prior to
obtaining an OPC. In light of J.M.'s medical
concerns and in light of the absence of
another placement resource, medical foster
care was the least restrictive placement
available for J.M.

<P20>Based on all these reasons, the Court
found reasonable efforts by DHS to prevent
or eliminate the need for removal of
J.M. from his home and clear and convincing
evidence that medical foster care was
the least restrictive placement available.

<HN00><EMBU>CONCLUSION</EMBU>

<P20>For the foregoing reasons, this Court
respectfully requests the Order entered by
this Court on February 13, 2024 adjudicating
J.M. dependent and committing J.M.
to the care of DHS be <EMB>AFFIRMED.</EMB>

<P20>OPINION BY <author>BECK</author>, <dgn>J.</dgn>:
[MT]
<P20>George Bloomer ("Bloomer") appeals
from the judgment of sentence entered by
the Northampton County Court of Common
Pleas ("trial court") following his conviction
of summary harassment.<fnr1> Upon review,
we conclude that Bloomer waived
appellate consideration of his claimed due
process violation, and that the Commonwealth
presented sufficient evidence to
support his conviction. We further hold, as
a matter of first impression, that section
9781(b) of the Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 9781(b), precludes our review of his claim
challenging the discretionary aspects of his
sentence because he was convicted of a
summary offense. We therefore affirm the
judgment of sentence.

<P20>We glean the following factual and procedural
histories from the certified record.
Bloomer and Paul Hitzel ("Hitzel") are
neighbors who live across an alleyway
from each other. On May 30, 2023, Hitzel
filed a private criminal complaint against
Bloomer, accusing Bloomer of harassing
him during two incidents on consecutive
days. Bloomer pled guilty to summary
harassment on August 23, 2023, and the
magisterial district judge imposed a fine
and costs of $468.75.
<Page 1285>

<P20>Bloomer filed a timely appeal from his
summary conviction and the trial court
held a trial de novo on December 18, 2023.
Bloomer appeared pro se and moved to
dismiss, which the trial court denied. At
trial, the Commonwealth presented Hitzel
as a witness, and the trial court admitted
Hitzel's cell phone video recording of
Bloomer. Bloomer did not present any evidence.
At the conclusion of trial, the trial
court found Bloomer guilty of summary
harassment and sentenced him to one and
one-half to three months of incarceration.<fnr2>
The trial court further ordered Bloomer to
not have contact with Hitzel, undergo a
mental health evaluation, and follow any
recommended treatment.

<P20>On December 27, 2023, Bloomer filed a
document entitled, "Motion for a Dismissal
and/or Lessening of Sentence Imposed on
Defendant as per Rule 720," in which he
claimed that the trial court imposed an
excessive sentence based on his "extremely
low" criminal record; the trial judge's bias
against him because he presided over
Bloomer's trial for attempted homicide of
Hitzel's father (of which a jury acquitted
him); and the trial judge's "speculation"
about Bloomer's mental health. The trial
court denied the motion because, pursuant
to Pa.R.Crim.P. 720(D), post-sentence motions
are not permitted in summary appeals
following a trial de novo. This timely
filed appeal followed.

<P20>Bloomer presents the following issues
for our review:

<B24>1. Did the trial court violate [] Bloomer's
due process rights by eliciting
testimony about purported incidents
of harassment beyond the allegations
in the criminal complaint?

<B24>2. Was the evidence insufficient to sustain
[] Bloomer's conviction for summary
harassment under [18 Pa.C.S.
&sect; 2709](a)(3) where his alleged criminality
consisted of (a) one 30-minute
incident involving non[-]obscene and
non-threatening statements[,] (b) an
undated incident where he purportedly
called the police on the victim[,]
and (c) an undated incident of purported
"witness intimidation" which
pre-dated the filing of criminal
charges?

<B24>3. Did the trial court abuse its discretion
by imposing a statutory maximum
sentence of 1 and 1/2 to 3
months for a non-violent summary
conviction where (a) the [magisterial
district judge] only imposed a fine[,]
(b) there was no proof that []
Bloomer had a criminal history[,] (c)
the record did not support a mental
health requirement[,] and (d) the trial
court exhibited bias after presiding
over [] Bloomer's acquittal of
attempted homicide in 2019?

<P00>Bloomer's Brief at 4 (suggested answers
omitted).

<P20>We begin with Bloomer's due process
claim. Bloomer contends that the trial
court violated his due process rights by
eliciting testimony at trial that went beyond
the factual allegations in the private
criminal complaint and using it as a basis
for his summary harassment conviction.
Bloomer's Brief at 11, 13.

<P20>By way of background, the private criminal
complaint alleged two incidents of
harassment: the first involved Bloomer
yelling to Hitzel, while they were both
outside, that Hitzel would "regret being a
witness because karma is going to get
you," and the second involved Hitzel hearing,
from inside his home, Bloomer repeatedly
<Page 1286>
yelling for approximately thirty
minutes, "Hey Paul why are you collecting
fraud social security for over twenty
years." Priv. Crim. Compl., 5/30/2023, &para; 2.
At trial, Hitzel testified to a third incident
in which Bloomer called the police as Hitzel
played with a "bubble gun" with his
children in his own yard, with Bloomer
claiming the "bubble gun" was a threat
directed at him and that the bubbles were
unsafe for birds. N.T., 12/18/2023, at 13-14,
30.

<P20>Bloomer argues that Hitzel's testimony
concerning this third "bubble gun" incident
could not be used as a basis to support his
summary harassment conviction because it
was not contained in the private criminal
complaint, in violation of his right to fair
notice of facts sufficient to advise him of
the nature of the offense charged. Bloomer's
Brief at 11, 13-14; Bloomer's Reply
Brief at 4-6 (citing <EMBI>Reitz v. Flower,</EMBI> 245
A.3d 723 (Pa. Super. 2021)). He argues
that because the Commonwealth had to
prove a "course of conduct" under subsection
(a)(3) of the harassment statute, the
third incident's omission from the complaint
was "critical and potentially dispositive,"
and the admission of this evidence
thus warrants reversal. Bloomer's Brief at
15-16 (citing 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2709(a)(3)).

<P20>The trial court found that Bloomer
waived this issue on two bases: (1) his
failure to raise the issue at trial and preserve
it for appellate review; and (2) too
vague a concise statement of errors in
which Bloomer failed to identify the specific
testimony he claimed went beyond the
allegations in the complaint. Trial Court
Opinion, 3/22/2024, at 2. "The issue of
waiver presents a question of law, and, as
such, our standard of review is de novo,
and our scope of review is plenary." <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Berrios,</EMBI> 297 A.3d 798, 805
(Pa. Super. 2023) (citation and quotation
marks omitted).

<P20>"Issues not raised in the trial
court are waived and cannot be raised for
the first time on appeal." Pa.R.A.P. 302(a).
"Indeed, issues, even those of constitutional
dimension, are waived if not raised in
the trial court. A new and different theory
of relief may not be successfully advanced
for the first time on appeal." <EMBI>Berrios,</EMBI> 297
A.3d at 805 (citation and quotation marks
omitted). "In order to preserve a claim
that the trial court erred in overruling an
objection, a party must state the specific
grounds of the objection." <EMBI>Brown v. Halpern,</EMBI>
202 A.3d 687, 708 (Pa. Super. 2019)
(citing Pa.R.E. 103(a)(1)(B)).

<P20>The record reflects that Bloomer objected
at trial to Hitzel's "bubble gun" testimony
as speculative, which the trial court
overruled. N.T., 12/18/2023, at 30. Bloomer
did not, however, raise a due process violation
based upon the presentation of testimony
beyond the allegations in the criminal
complaint. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> We therefore agree
with the trial court's conclusion that
Bloomer failed to preserve this issue for
our review. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 302(a); Pa.R.E.
103(a)(1)(B); <EMBI>Berrios,</EMBI> 297 A.3d at 805;
<EMBI>Brown,</EMBI> 202 A.3d at 708 (holding appellants
failed to preserve for appellate review
their claim that the trial court erred in
overruling their objection to testimony because
the specific ground for the objection
at trial (hearsay) was different than that
claimed on appeal (relevance)). Accordingly,
Bloomer's first issue is waived and not
reviewable by this Court on appeal.

<P20>For his second issue, Bloomer argues
that the Commonwealth presented
insufficient evidence to support his summary
harassment conviction. Bloomer's
Brief at 16-21. Bloomer challenges Hitzel's
<Page 1287>
testimony as non-specific and speculative,
pointing to Hitzel's inability to recall a
specific date and "guess" that Bloomer was
the one who called police about the "bubble
gun."<fnr3> <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 19. Bloomer further assails
Hitzel's testimony concerning his
threats based on Hitzel serving as a witness
because Hitzel was not asked and did
not provide a date for the incident and did
not identify a specific legal proceeding in
which Hitzel was a witness. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 20.

<P20>Our Court's standard of review
of a challenge to the sufficiency of the
evidence is well settled:

<B22>In reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence
claim, we must determine whether
the evidence admitted at trial, as well as
all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom,
when viewed in the light most
favorable to the verdict winner, are sufficient
to support all elements of the
offense. Additionally, we may not reweigh
the evidence or substitute our
own judgment for that of the fact finder.
The evidence may be entirely circumstantial
as long as it links the accused to
the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

<P00><EMBI>Commonwealth v. Juray,</EMBI> 275 A.3d 1037,
1042 (Pa. Super. 2022) (quotation marks
and citations omitted). "[A] sufficiency of
the evidence review does not include an
assessment of credibility of testimony offered
by the Commonwealth. Instead, such
arguments are more properly characterized
as challenges to [the] weight of evidence."
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 1043 (citations omitted). The
trial court, sitting as factfinder at a bench
trial, "is free to believe all, part, or none of
the evidence presented." <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Williams,</EMBI> 302 A.3d 117, 120 (Pa. Super.
2023) (quotation marks and citation omitted).

<P20>"A person commits the crime of harassment
when, with intent to harass, annoy or
alarm another, the person ... engages in a
course of conduct or repeatedly commits
acts which serve no legitimate purpose[.]"
18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2709(a)(3). A "course of conduct"
is defined as "[a] pattern of actions
composed of more than one act over a
period of time, however short, evidencing a
continuity of conduct." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> &sect; 2709(f).

<P20>The trial court analyzed Bloomer's sufficiency
claim as follows:

<B22>Here, the evidence established that
while [Hitzel] was in his backyard playing
with his children using a bubble gun,
Bloomer called the police. Bloomer and
[Hitzel] are neighbors. When police arrived,
Bloomer claimed that [Hitzel] was
threatening him and that the bubble gun
was not safe for the birds. Next, Bloomer
threatened [Hitzel], stating that he
would regret being a witness against
Bloomer concerning another matter. Finally,
early one morning as [Hitzel] was
sleeping, Bloomer stood outside the Hitzels'
home and, for approximately thirty
minutes, repeatedly stated in a loud
voice, "Hey, Paul Hitzel, why are you
committing Social Security fraud" over
and over. Based upon the above testimony,
it is clear that Bloomer engaged in a
course of conduct and repeatedly committed
acts that served no legitimate
purpose other than to intentionally harass,
annoy or alarm [Hitzel]. Therefore,
the evidence was clearly sufficient to
sustain Bloomer's conviction.

<P00>Trial Court Opinion, 3/22/2024, at 3-4.

<P20>The certified record confirms the trial
court's findings. <EMBI>See</EMBI> N.T., 12/18/2023, at
<Page 1288>
10, 12-14, 16-19, 21, 25, 27, 30-31; Commonwealth
Ex. 1 (Hitzel's cell phone video).
Moreover, to the extent Bloomer challenges
the credibility of Hitzel's testimony,
such a claim goes to the weight of the
evidence, not its sufficiency. <EMBI>See Juray,</EMBI>
275 A.3d at 1043. The trial court, sitting as
factfinder, was the arbiter of credibility,
free to believe all, part, or none of the
Commonwealth's evidence. <EMBI>See Williams,</EMBI>
302 A.3d at 120.

<P20>Based upon our review, we conclude that
the evidence at trial, as well as all reasonable
inferences drawn therefrom, when
viewed in the light most favorable to the
Commonwealth as verdict winner, were
sufficient to support Bloomer's summary
harassment conviction. <EMBI>See Commonwealth
v. Barzyk,</EMBI> 692 A.2d 211, 214-15
(Pa. Super. 1997) (holding evidence of an
incident on one date was part of a course
of conduct and sufficient to sustain a
harassment conviction under subsection
(a)(3) where the victim visited a friend
whose house was adjacent to the appellant's
house and the appellant played, rewound,
and replayed several times an audio
tape of pig noises at a high volume
while mocking the victim).

<P20>For his final issue, Bloomer argues that
the trial court imposed a "manifestly excessive
statutory maximum sentence for a
non-violent summary conviction." Bloomer's
Brief at 21. Specifically, he contends
that the trial court should have imposed a
lesser sentence because (1) the magisterial
district judge imposed only a fine; (2) the
record did not show that Bloomer had a
criminal history; (3) the record did not
support imposing a mental health condition;
and (4) the trial judge exhibited bias
against Bloomer because he presided over
Bloomer's 2019 trial for attempted homicide.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 22-25.

<P20>Bloomer challenges the discretionary
aspects of his sentence for his summary
conviction. Before we address the
merits of this issue, however, we must
determine whether we have jurisdiction to
decide it. <EMBI>See Commonwealth v. Collins,</EMBI>
286 A.3d 767, 778 (Pa. Super. 2022) ("A
challenge to the discretionary aspect of a
sentence is not appealable as of right.
Rather, an appellant challenging the sentencing
court's discretion must invoke this
Court's jurisdiction[.]") (citation omitted);
<EMBI>see also Commonwealth v. Gaines,</EMBI> 127
A.3d 15, 17 (Pa. Super. 2015) (<EM>en banc</EM>)
("We may raise issues concerning our appellate
jurisdiction sua sponte.") (citation
omitted). This inquiry involves a question
of statutory interpretation, raising a question
of law for which our standard of review
is de novo and our scope of review is
plenary. <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Bartic,</EMBI> 303
A.3d 124, 131 (Pa. Super. 2023).

<P20>"Appellate review of sentences is governed
statutorily, by Subchapter G of the
Sentencing Code, 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9781." <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Tuladziecki,</EMBI> 513 Pa. 508,
522 A.2d 17, 18 (1987). It states, in pertinent
part:

<B22><EMB>(b) Allowance of appeal.</EMB>&mdash;The defendant
or the Commonwealth may file a
petition for allowance of appeal of the
discretionary aspects of a sentence for a
<EMB>felony or a misdemeanor</EMB> to the appellate
court that has initial jurisdiction for
such appeals. Allowance of appeal may
be granted at the discretion of the appellate
court where it appears that there
is a substantial question that the sentence
imposed is not appropriate under
this chapter.

<B22><EMB>(c) Determination on appeal.</EMB>&mdash;The appellate
court shall vacate the sentence
and remand the case to the sentencing
court with instructions if it finds:
<Page 1289>

<B44>(1) the sentencing court purported to
sentence within the sentencing guidelines
but applied the guidelines erroneously;

<B44>(2) the sentencing court sentenced
within the sentencing guidelines but
the case involves circumstances where
the application of the guidelines would
be clearly unreasonable; or

<B44>(3) the sentencing court sentenced
outside the sentencing guidelines and
the sentence is unreasonable.

<B22>In all other cases the appellate court
shall affirm the sentence imposed by the
sentencing court.

<P00>42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9781(b)-(c) (some emphasis
added);<fnr4> <EMBI>see also</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 902 cmt.<fnr5>

<P20>In analyzing this statute, we
are guided by the Statutory Construction
Act, pursuant to which we must "ascertain
and effectuate the intention of the General
Assembly." 1 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1921(a). "Every
statute shall be construed, if possible, to
give effect to all its provisions." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> "When
the words of a statute are clear and free
from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to
be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing
its spirit." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> &sect; 1921(b). "Generally,
the best indication of the General Assembly's
intent may be found in the plain
language of the statute. In this regard, it
is not for the courts to add, by interpretation,
to a statute, a requirement which the
legislature did not see fit to include." <EMBI>Commonwealth
v. Wright,</EMBI> 609 Pa. 22, 14 A.3d
798, 814 (2011) (cleaned up). We must
therefore not only "listen attentively to
what a statute says," but also "listen attentively
to what it does not say." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> (citation
omitted).

<P20>The plain language of section 9781(b) is
clear: a request for review of a discretionary
sentencing claim may be brought by
either party to the appeal following a conviction
of a felony or misdemeanor. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 42
Pa.C.S. &sect; 9781(b). Notably absent from the
provision is a statement permitting a petition
for allowance of appeal of a discretionary
sentencing claim to be brought following
a conviction of a summary offense.

<P20>The statute continues, providing the circumstances
wherein this Court may vacate
the sentence imposed. <EMBI>See id.</EMBI> &sect; 9781(c).
Each basis for vacatur is premised upon
the trial court's application of, or failure to
<Page 1290>
apply, the sentencing guidelines&mdash;an erroneous
application, a clearly unreasonable
application, or an unreasonable sentence
imposed outside the guideline range.<fnr6> <EMBI>See
id.</EMBI> Notably, however, "the sentencing
guidelines do not apply to summary offenses
... and therefore provide no basis
on which to conclude that the sentence was
an abuse of discretion." <EMBI>Collins,</EMBI> 286 A.3d
at 779 (citing 204 Pa.Code. &sect; 303.1(a)).<fnr7> As
such, there is no basis under the law that
this Court could vacate a discretionary
sentencing claim for a summary conviction.

<P20>Based upon the plain language of the
statute&mdash;heeding both what subsections (b)
and (c) say and what the provisions omit&mdash;
it is clear that the General Assembly did
not provide for this Court's review of discretionary
sentencing claims for summary
convictions.

<P20>Our research reveals no published decision
by this Court that has conducted a
statutory analysis of section 9781 as it
pertains to the appealability of the discretionary
aspects of a summary sentence. In
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Winters,</EMBI> 733 WDA
2018, 2019 WL 4733473 (Pa. Super. Sept.
27, 2019) (non-precedential decision),<fnr8> this
Court acknowledged that section 9781(b) of
the Sentencing Code does not contemplate
discretionary sentencing challenges for
summary offenses. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at *3 n.3. Additionally,
although recognizing "the incongruity
inherent in analyzing a summary conviction
under a framework derived from 42
Pa.C.S.[] &sect; 9781," we nonetheless considered
the discretionary aspects of Winters'
sentence imposed for a summary conviction
of driving while operating privileges
were suspended. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at *1, 3-4 & n.3. We
explained that we felt "obligated to do so
under the constraints of precedent, the
factual circumstances [of the case], and in
the absence of objection to such analysis
by either party." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at *3 n.3. We believed
we were bound by our Supreme Court's
decision in <EMBI>Tuladziecki,</EMBI><fnr9> and this Court's
decisions in <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Kraft</EMBI> and
<EMBI>Commonwealth v. Barzyk. Winters,</EMBI> 2019
WL 4733473, at *3 n.3.
<Page 1291>

<P20>Beginning with <EMBI>Tuladziecki,</EMBI> the <EMBI>Winters</EMBI>
Court focused on the following language
to support its consideration of the
appellant's claim:

<B22>[W]e find it significant that Section
9781(b) specifies that allowance of appeal
of the discretionary aspects of sentence
may be granted "where it appears
that there is a substantial question that
the sentence imposed is not appropriate
<EM>under this chapter.</EM>" The chapter referred
to is, of course, the entire Sentencing
Code.

<P00><EMBI>Tuladziecki,</EMBI> 522 A.2d at 20 (emphasis in
original). Reviewing the above-quoted language
in context, however, we are constrained
to disagree that <EMBI>Tuladziecki</EMBI>
supports our consideration of a summary
discretionary sentencing claim.

<P20>At issue in <EMBI>Tuladziecki</EMBI> was the Commonwealth's
failure to include in its brief a
Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f) statement as to why its
appeal of the discretionary aspects of the
sentence should be allowed, and Tuladziecki
objected to its absence. <EMBI>Tuladziecki,</EMBI>
522 A.2d at 19. Recognizing the requirement
that the appellant raise a substantial
question in accordance with section 9781(b)
to invoke this Court's jurisdiction, our
High Court made clear that our consideration
of the Rule 2119(f) statement was
required under the circumstances prior to
examining and ruling upon the merits of
the sentencing claim. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Otherwise, the
Court found, the appellant would effectively
obtain an appeal as of right from the
discretionary aspect of a sentence, in contravention
of the language of section
9781(b). <EMBI>Id.</EMBI> Importantly, the <EMBI>Tuladziecki</EMBI>
Court observed that "an enlargement of
the appeal rights of a party cannot be
accomplished by rule of court" and as
such, "it is essential that the rules of procedure
governing appeals such as this [discretionary
aspects of sentence claim] be
followed precisely." <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>

<P20>In mandating that appellants present
separately in their briefs a Rule 2119(f)
statement, our Supreme Court explained
that "important concerns of substance"
guided its decision:

<B22>In addition to preserving the respective
rights of both parties according to the
jurisdictional scheme provided by the
legislature, it furthers the purpose evident
in the Sentencing Code as a whole
of limiting any challenges to the trial
court's evaluation of the multitude of
factors impinging on the sentencing decision
to exceptional cases. In this regard
we find it significant that Section
9781(b) specifies that allowance of appeal
of the discretionary aspects of sentence
may be granted "where it appears
that there is a substantial question that
the sentence imposed is not appropriate
<EM>under this chapter.</EM>" (Emphasis added).
The chapter referred to is, of course, the
entire Sentencing Code.

<P00><EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 19-20 (emphasis in original).

<P20><EMBI>Tuladziecki</EMBI> did not involve a summary
offense conviction and as such, the first
sentence of section 9781(b), limiting petitions
for allowance of appeal to felonies
and misdemeanors, was not at issue. In
other words, the <EMBI>Tuladziecki</EMBI> Court did
not address whether section 9781(b) permitted
an appellant to file a petition for
allowance of appeal of the discretionary
aspects of a sentence for a summary offense.
Accordingly, we are not persuaded
by <EMBI>Winters</EMBI>' analysis that <EMBI>Tuladziecki</EMBI> permits
our review of discretionary sentencing
claims for summary offenses.

<P20><EMBI>Winters</EMBI> further found it was bound by
this Court's prior decisions in <EMBI>Kraft</EMBI> and
<EMBI>Barzyk. See Winters,</EMBI> 2019 WL 4733473,
<Page 1292>
at *3 n.3 (citing <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Kraft,</EMBI>
737 A.2d 755, 757 (Pa. Super. 1999); <EMBI>Barzyk,</EMBI>
692 A.2d at 216). We acknowledge, as
<EMBI>Winters</EMBI> did, that in both cases, this Court
addressed appeals of discretionary sentencing
claims for summary convictions
utilizing the framework provided by section
9781(b). In each case, however, the
Court did so without analysis or consideration
of the applicability of section 9781(b).

<P20>In <EMBI>Kraft,</EMBI> this Court addressed whether
an appellant sentenced to ninety days of
incarceration for her summary conviction
of driving while under suspension raised a
substantial question that the sentence imposed
was not appropriate under section
9781(b). The Court concluded that two of
her claims did not raise a substantial question
and the third had no merit. <EMBI>Kraft,</EMBI> 737
A.2d at 756-57. Similarly, in <EMBI>Barzyk,</EMBI> we
held that an appellant sentenced to thirty
days of incarceration for his summary
harassment conviction failed to raise a substantial
question under section 9781(b).
<EMBI>Barzyk,</EMBI> 692 A.2d at 216-17. Both <EMBI>Kraft</EMBI>
and <EMBI>Barzyk</EMBI> cited to <EMBI>Tuladziecki,</EMBI> but did
so for the proposition that the right to
appeal from a discretionary aspect of a
sentence is not absolute and must raise a
substantial question that the sentence was
not appropriate. <EMBI>See Kraft,</EMBI> 737 A.2d at
756; <EMBI>Barzyk,</EMBI> 692 A.2d at 216. Neither case
discussed whether section 9781(b) applies
to summary offenses.

<P20>Since <EMBI>Winters,</EMBI> this Court has continued,
without discussion of the limiting language
of section 9781(b), to consider discretionary
sentencing claims raised following a
summary conviction. <EMBI>See, e.g., Collins,</EMBI> 286
A.3d at 778-80 (allowing challenge to the
discretionary aspects of appellant's fifteen-day
jail sentence imposed for two summary
harassment convictions, but concluding
no relief was due as the trial court's
sentence was not based upon bias against
the appellant); <EMBI>Commonwealth v. Stewart,</EMBI>
1674 MDA 2019, 2020 WL 3263716, at
*2-4 (Pa. Super. June 16, 2020) (non-precedential
decision) (finding no substantial
question raised in challenge to trial court's
exercise of discretion for sentence of 20 to
180 days of incarceration imposed for two
summary disorderly conduct convictions).
In the absence of any consideration of
whether section 9781(b) allows discretionary
sentencing claims to be brought for
summary convictions, these cases are neither
precedential nor persuasive here.

<P20>We find further support for our reading
of section 9781(b) in our recent decision in
<EMBI>Bartic.</EMBI> There, this Court addressed
whether a discretionary sentencing claim
was properly before the Court in an appeal
from sentences imposed for six indirect
criminal contempt convictions that
stemmed from violations of a final protection
from abuse order issued pursuant to
section 6114 of the Protection from Abuse
Act.<fnr10> <EMBI>Bartic,</EMBI> 303 A.3d at 130. As we do
here, the <EMBI>Bartic</EMBI> Court examined the statutory
language of section 9781(b), observing
that the statutory provision limits challenges
to the discretionary aspects of a
sentence to felonies and misdemeanors. <EMBI>Id.</EMBI>
at 133. Finding that the crime of indirect
criminal contempt under section 6114 is a
misdemeanor, we concluded that the appellant
was permitted to petition our Court
under section 9781(b) for allowance of appeal.
<EMBI>Id.</EMBI> at 134. Although a different context,
<EMBI>Bartic</EMBI> confirmed what the plain language
of section 9781(b) mandates&mdash;that
is, petitions for allowance of appeal from
the discretionary aspects of a sentence are
limited to felonies and misdemeanors.

<P20>In light of the foregoing, we conclude
that an appellant is not permitted
<Page 1293>
under section 9781(b) of the Sentencing
Code to challenge the discretionary aspects
of a sentence imposed for a summary
offense. This holding is consistent with the
plain language of the statute as well as the
<EMBI>Tuladziecki</EMBI> Court's recognition that "an
enlargement of the appeal rights of a party
cannot be accomplished by rule of court[.]"
<EMBI>Tuladziecki,</EMBI> 522 A.2d at 19. Accordingly,
we deny Bloomer's petition for allowance
of appeal of the discretionary aspects of
his sentence.

<P20>Judgment of sentence affirmed.
<FN>
<fnt*> Former Justice specially assigned to the Superior
Court.

<fnt1> 18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 2709(a)(3).

<fnt2> The trial court stayed Bloomer's sentence
pending appeal. N.T., 12/18/2023, at 35.

<fnt3> In his second issue, Bloomer appears to
also claim trial court error in overruling his
objection to Hitzel's "bubble gun" testimony
as speculative. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Bloomer's Brief at 19-20.
To the extent he makes such a claim, it is
waived for failure to raise it in his concise
statement of errors complained of on appeal.
<EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)(4)(vii).

<fnt4> Bloomer does not contest the legality of his
sentence. <EMBI>See</EMBI> 42 Pa.C.S. &sect; 9781(a) ("The defendant
or the Commonwealth may appeal as
of right the legality of the sentence."). Although
the trial court sentenced Bloomer to
the statutory maximum term of incarceration,
it was within the limit permitted by law. <EMBI>See</EMBI>
18 Pa.C.S. &sect; 1105 ("A person who has been
convicted of a summary offense may be sentenced
to imprisonment for a term which
shall be fixed by the court at not more than 90
days.").

<fnt5> The Comment to Rule 902 provides as follows:

<B22>Section 9781 of the Sentencing Code (42
Pa.C.S. &sect; 9781) provides that the defendant
or the Commonwealth may file a "petition
for allowance of appeal" of the discretionary
aspects of a sentence for a <EMB>felony or a
misdemeanor.</EMB> The notice of appeal under
this chapter (<EMBI>see</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 904 (content of
the notice of appeal), in conjunction with
the requirements set forth in Pa.R.A.P.
2116(b) and 2119(f), operates as the "petition
for allowance of appeal" under the
Sentencing Code. No additional wording is
required or appropriate in the notice of
appeal.

<B22>In effect, the filing of the "petition for allowance
of appeal" contemplated by the
statute is deferred by these rules until the
briefing stage, where the question of the
appropriateness of the discretionary aspects
of the sentence may be briefed and argued
in the usual manner. <EMBI>See</EMBI> Pa.R.A.P. 2116(b)
and note; Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f) and note.

the mandatory nature of Rule 2119(f) of the
Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure,
which provides as follows:

<B22>An appellant who challenges the discretionary
aspects of a sentence in a criminal
matter shall set forth in a separate section
